I feel like I‚Äôm fine this way but when I have to act like a normal person around people (everybody eats dinner and everybody limits their alcohol and they all go to bed by 10pm) it makes me want to crawl out of my skin.

Aside from ~aN eArLy DeAtH~ i don‚Äôt really see the problem with getting my caloric intake from alcohol. I haven‚Äôt eaten in 2 days, I‚Äôve been getting 3 hours sleep at night‚Ä¶ yet the quality of my work is better than it‚Äôs ever been, I‚Äôm more social than I‚Äôve ever been, and my life is more organized and enjoyable than it‚Äôs ever been. Except for the discomfort when i have to ‚Äúact normal‚Äù (eat instead of drink)

My disordered eating stems from my crippling IBS and my drinking started with my social anxiety. I feel like i found the golden key to living my best life.

Just venting/seeking solidarity here i guess. Using a throwaway but really glad i found this sub bc I‚Äôve always felt so alone in my ~existence~ like this"

Since hs ( am 24 now) I started to drink, I love drinking ( is one of my pleasures and a coping mechanism for my unfortunate events in my life, love smoking too, cigs and the spicy grass) I do not overdo it tho. 
  So my question is what alcohol beverages you can make that will be low cal? I am a wine lover ( dry white wine mixed with sparkling water is my go-to) but wandered if you guys know other beverage recipes that might be low cal? 
PS: I live in Eastern Europe and drinking and smoking is part of our culture. IK is bad for me, but as long as I do not overdo it, I am ok.

I landed on ""definitely need at least a detox center,"" set up one, and called my grandfather, the father of my aunt, and spilled the beans for an hour. He was disappointed in me but realizes I know I made a mistake. HE LET ME KNOW that my aunt actually canceled the trip and will not be coming here to wonder why the apartment floor is so sticky and I'm completely absent. That eased up my anxiety so much that I called mum and dad after to tell them what happened. They weren't angry, just so happy that I was getting help.

All's well that ends well. They're on the way right now to pick me up. I'm going to kick this addiction in the ass this week. Wish me luck!

EDIT: Aaaaaaaaaaaand they just called again to say they're not on the way and I need a higher level of care because eating disorder. What the fuck. I have no words. An eating disorder won't kill me right now at this very moment, but I know for a fact that if I don't get immediate alcohol help I either need to keep drinking or pray to some unknown entity that delirium tremens won't take over my withdrawal. Man fuck this I'm upset.

EDIT: aaaaaaaaaaaand ladies and gentlemen and enbies and otherkin drumroll to this saga. They let me back in. It's important to advocate for your mental health. I KNOW I needed immediate attention which they denied. I told them point blank ""detox or death for me right now. We can troubleshoot anorexia later AFTER I get completely detoxed"" My bags are packed, I ate a few Takis after no food for like what three days, they're picking me up in two hours, and this nightmare will enter a new chapter of recovery and healing.

Don't be a me. Get help early before you spiral like this into total failure. It's just not fun to deal with this and you all know that"

You know you're drunkorexic when you eat a small quesadilla and decide that is PLENTY to combat almost half a liter of vodka, plus various other sorts and amounts of alcohol.

Surprisingly, I wasn't hungover. 

You consider a fifth of jack daniels at 9am breakfast lunch and dinner.

When your friends ask for a chaser you laugh, take their shot straight, and tell them to use water.

You had to help your shaky ex girlfriend up the stairs because all she ate for three days was crown royal ""it's okay babes we got klonopins for dinner.""

You have to walk to the store to get a 24 pack and almost pass out walking up the hill to your apartment.

Your friend ordered dominos and you accidentally ate half the pizza, throw it up, and continue shooting vodka.

Same friend always buys you a burrito out of pity but you can't even eat half of it without getting your buzz.

You fall off your friends porch because you were drunk since the night before and ate nothing.

You get called an alcoholic even though you're underage but can out drink half your friends on an empty stomach.

Sorry, I'm broke, and am basically being forced into sobriety by my mother (hah!) so I'm reminiscing.

And my body is reacting horribly to this lifestyle...ugh yall I can't fucking sleep someone bring me some jacky d! I've got more but I've done so much xanax this past year I can't remember shit."

So to make a long story short, I went through an awful breakup/seperation with my boyfriend of 5y. I left him because of a mid 20s crisis and ended up regretting it. He didn't want me back. I moved back home to my dad and gained 10kg from drinking and binge eating.

I finally reached a turning point when I weighed myself last summer and was 75kg. I started dieting and drinking less and managed to go down to 63kg before Christmas. After Christmas I got a new job that I really enjoy, even though it has nothing to do with my education. I felt like life was actually good. During this time, I was barely eating (purging everything I ate) and drinking 4-5 days a week (not getting drunk every day, but having wine with friends etc).

This summer was pretty good, especially compared to the last one. I bought my dream apartment and felt comfortable being single. Around this time i started seeing a guy who I kind of liked. I didn't develope any deep feelings but I enjoyed his company a lot. The problem was that I've become so scared of opening up to someone after all the trauma of last year. Slowly he made me open up more and I really appreciated it. He pointed out that i seem to drink a lot, which I do. I drink a little almost everyday, usually a lot on the weekends. I didn't think about it to much, because that's how me and my friends hang out. 

I drank a lot last week and on Friday I had a bunch of white wine with my family. I didn't eat anything. I usually don't stay up to late on weekends. I like to drink wine, maybe go out a with with my friends and as soon as I feel like I've had enough I'll go home. Usually around 12.30. However, the guy I'm seeing stays up really late and I wanted to see him, so mu DUMB ASS decides to take Adderall, hoping to be able to stay up later. 

15 min after taking the Adderall I pretty much blackout. I can't remember anything. Apparently I appeared quite intoxicated, and after his friends left he confronted me about it (i don't remember this part). Allegedly, after he confronts me, I lash out and start yelling at him that he means absolutely nothing to me, that he should just leave and that i never cared about him whatsoever. This went on for like 10-15 min. He leaves for the bathroom, and when he came back, i had forgotten all about what i apparently said. I started freaking out because he was so upset and genuinely did not remember saying all those things. I don't feel that way at all, however I have had those thoughts when trying to protect myself when being scared of him dumping me. 

I didn't remember any of it the next morning. He called me and accused me of being mentally ill and an alcoholic. He doesn't want to see me anymore. I barely said anything cause I was so shocked of what had happened. It literally sounds like I was possessed. 

In my mind, it has to be the pills and the alcohol. I genuinely don't agree with anything I told him during those blacked out 15 min. It's really scary and I'm devastated about him not wanting to see me and also accusing me of being a schizophrenic drunk. 

So. This is it. I have to start taking responsibility for my actions and from now on, I will always make sure to eat really well before drinking, never have more than 5 units and NEVER take pills again. 

I just wanted to tell my story and get some advice/support. Thanks for reading."

i drank occasionally up until 3 months ago when my ana relapse started, & then drank essentially every day for these last 3 months. my tolerance steadily got higher, which google says is a sign of physical addiction. coupled with the anorexia, i get that‚Äôs really dangerous. 

anyway, i‚Äôm 5 days sober today & planning on taking at minimum a 2 week break to reset my tolerance (which again is what google said would do it). it hasn‚Äôt really been hard not to drink besides the withdrawal headaches, which makes me think how can i be an alcoholic if it‚Äôs that easy to stop? 

i‚Äôm literally only 19 & this was only a 3 month thing, so am i really just fucked for life? like does that make me an irreversible alcoholic? i want to go back to moderate drinking on the weekends, probably every weekend but at least that isn‚Äôt daily like i had been. does anyone have anything to comment on this? 

i do get a doctor would have better advice but i don‚Äôt want my doctor telling my parents :// lmk yall thoughts :,)"

I picked up a bunch of booze after i got off work tonight and then went back to the mall I work at to drink it in the mall bathroom and get an uber home. I need to stop because theyre catching on to me. I came out of the bathroom and security was sitting outside flashing their lights but they didn't say anything when I walked by them. To get in my ride. 

Anyways whenever i get out of an uber it'll take me  a second to grab my stuff and exit the vehicle. Ill usually say ""sorry"" while im getting my bearings. My driver was like ""no take your time you might fall, you know"" and i just was like ""haha yeah"" without really thinking about it but now im like fall? Like no I'm not gonna fall exiting your car I just need a second to grab my bags and make sure I didn't leave anything.

This is why I hate drinking though. Because it could have been an innocent comment but here I am kinda taking it personally because I know I'm a drunk and drank but if i was sober I wouldn't even have a reason to dwell on this. 

Sorry if none of this made sense, just venting i guess."

i‚Äôm now in recovery for the ana because as it turns out you can only survive for so long on so little calories & hella alcohol before shit stops working. im also 4 days sober, which was easy, but i‚Äôve already turned back to small binges, i guess to replace the alcohol. don‚Äôt see a way out tbh."

Right now I only have access to wine because liquor stores are closed (New Zealand doesn't sell liquor in supermarkets) and I just feel so stuck"

Hotel A. Cons: has an outdoor pool that is subject to weather, is slightly more expensive

Hotel B. Cons: is new & don‚Äôt know what to expect , only double Queen beds and no suites, longer walking distance if I wanted to go out to eat 
Pros: indoor pool, cheaper, and 24/7 snack bar that includes wine & beer.

I had been meaning to save it for a special occasion, but figured, fuck it. With nervous anticipation, I brace myself for the mixed shot I made. 

I winced but then realized it was smooth. So, incredibly smooth! So smooth that‚Ä¶.wait a second. I go to smell the bottle, and‚Ä¶.nothing. No alcoholic scent whatsoever. 

I have no idea if it had previously been opened and all the alcohol evaporated over the decades, if someone had intentionally replaced it with water as a gag gift, or if I myself had for some reason replaced it with water in a drunken stupor for future damage control. 

Either way, I just took a mixed shot of fucking water. I am disappointed. I am BOTHERED."

when anxiety brain is telling me to worry about something i tell it: ""this is not a helpful thought, so i'm going to disregard it.""     
    
having a thought does not make it true. you may think, ""i suck, everyone hates me."" but that thought may not be correct. our brains like to have these thoughts when we're upset. our brains are liars sometimes.     
    
have to make a phone call on monday? worrying won't make it easier.     
    
worrying about something i did 5 years ago? damage is already done.     
    
worrying about going into the kitchen and having to possibly interact with a roommate? they don't hate me. they're pizza delivery drivers and deal with weirder people than me all the time.     
    
if there is something i probably should worry about, i can worry about it later, when i'm feeling stable enough to worry without totally breaking down. but usually, worrying is fucking useless and should be dismissed.     
    
obviously it's not always easy to dismiss anxiety thoughts, but if you try to tell it to fuck off it does get easier to handle.    
      
p.s. for those who are anxious right now:         
distract yourself. go on a walk. look at cute animal pics. read a book, put on some music you love. remember your bad mood won't last forever."

I did not drink yesterday nor attempt to dampen my mind with my guy's favorite weed gummies he always keeps around. The main things I noticed: 1) Much more energy/desire to continue being productive. 2) ""I feel so AWAKE."" I kept looking around for things to do instead of just watching Netflix. 3) I still got sleepy around the time I usually do - which was comforting considering I was afraid of having a hard time falling asleep. 4) Sleep quality was about the same, & I woke up with a similar grogginess but no worry about an impending headache.

So day 1 went well, my first day without drinking in... I couldn't even tell you. It's my weekend now, though, but I'm hanging out with a sober friend today. Limited food & no liquor makes me...energetic? Go figure."

We are seeking to recruit participants for an online survey who are over the age of 18 years, and who are currently experiencing difficulties with overeating, emotional eating, or binge eating.

[https://swinuw.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6hztnk5hnXfyhJs](https://swinuw.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6hztnk5hnXfyhJs?fbclid=IwAR3krT8fz-pSV1_-3K00O6rZ3xefRz2or895OtzTZJ2qYrU9IR5bhZCSqYg)

***As a token of appreciation for your time and for sharing your experience, participants who enter their details at the end of the survey will go into a raffle to win 1 of 10 Amazon e-Gift cards valued at AUD$100.***

This research project aims to develop a motives for binge eating scale. This study is also exploring factors that may increase the risk of binge eating. Specifically, this study examines the relationships between negative childhood experiences (e.g., emotional abuse or invalidation), shame, self-compassion, and motives for binge eating. It is hoped that the results of this research will inform preventative and treatment strategies for individuals experiencing binge eating. The survey will take approximately 70 minutes to complete. Participation in this survey is voluntary, no identifiable information will be collected, and all responses will remain anonymous, except for those participants who choose to provide their contact details at the end of the survey for the purpose of follow-up interviews, in which case information will remain private and only accessible to the student investigator, co-investigator, and principal investigator.

It would also be greatly appreciated if you could forward this advertisement or survey link to any friends, colleagues, or family members who are currently experiencing difficulties with binge eating, as I am hoping to reach as many people as possible. Thank you for your time and assistance. If you have any questions regarding the project, please contact me via email at [elyseologhlen@swin.edu.au](mailto:elyseologhlen@swin.edu.au) or the principal investigator Dr Roslyn Galligan via email at [rgalligan@swin.edu.au](mailto:rgalligan@swin.edu.au).

I dont make much money and I sqander it all on alcohol. Thankfully I still live with ny parents so no rent to pay for now. But I cant live like this. I'm rationing myself to 1 bottle of vodka every other day or every 2 days if I'm not too depressed. Its just not enough though. I can comfortably drink 1 bottle of vodka a day. Thats good enough to disassociate and get me through my work but the money and calories im really worried about. 

I want to save up for my future  for a house etc. But rn im finding that if I don't spend money on alcohol I know I'll just spend it on random crap I don't need like more clothes or makeup.

I‚Äôm 20f and didn‚Äôt have a history of drinking before this. How many nights can I do this combined with my ED before I start to seriously harm my body? I‚Äôm 3 days without drinking right now but it‚Äôs so tempting. I love how easy it is to fall asleep after a ton of wine.

Anyway, any comments are appreciated. I hope you guys are having a good day/evening/night üíò"

To be drunk when I fall asleep and have a harder time falling asleep? I have insomnia but drinking (unless it‚Äôs one or two) doesn‚Äôt help it makes it worse. Also when I go to sleep even slightly tipsy I‚Äôm hungover, but if I sober up a bit before bed I‚Äôm more ok.

Hangovers have been fueling my depression and fucking my life up bc I can‚Äôt get anything done and they ruin my sleep schedule. I have been better this past week about portioning my drinks so I‚Äôm not getting fucked up, but still I have had a slight hangover twice this week all because I drank then went to sleep immediately after.

I am so mad at myself because I was barely in a drinking mood yesterday  (rare for me, I always wanna drink if I have booze lol) but I had a few trulys while playing a game and stupidly CHUGGED one even though I was tired and ready for bed. I don‚Äôt know why I did it! Drinking quickly like that makes me really awake (sleep is hard for me to get anyways) so I stayed up and had another (also basically chugged it). All that just to not enjoy my drunkness bc it was way past bedtime. I‚Äôm also mad at me bc I wanted to drink today and FaceTime with my family but I feel weird bc I drank yesterday and I‚Äôm kinda hungover, but situations like yesterday make me wanna drink bc I‚Äôm like well I didn‚Äôt even enjoy my drunk I went to sleep so I deserve a drink lol.

Sorry this was a long post about something small but I just hate myself rn. I wouldn‚Äôt rant like this if this was a one off thing but of course this happens all the time."

In order to not be hungover, I have to eat before drinking and go to bed sober (which means also eating before bed). Sometimes I am still hungover and that means I am prone to binge eating. I don‚Äôt binge eat otherwise, only when hungover, but bc i drink so much and don‚Äôt deal with hangovers well I have gotten fat. 


I can easily stay under a normal cal amount and drink but not while avoiding blacking out and keeping hangovers at bay (although I‚Äôm starting to feel it‚Äôs all in my head/kind of a myth bc I‚Äôm still getting the hangovers).
