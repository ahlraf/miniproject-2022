I've been struggling with mild depression for a bit more than a month now, which was preceded by a long, near-constant apathetic state of mind. Not the terribly oppressive kind, but one that I couldn't manage to escape, evidently.

I managed to identify the core issue I'm having, the reason I cannot seem to find anything enjoyable for extended periods of time, gradually sinking into states of despair, ennui, and general apathy.

For some reason, my brain does not respond with a feeling of reward most of the time when I'd want to accomplish something. I see the logical reasons why I'd want to get from A to B, but 99% of the time there's zero satisfaction coming from them. I should clarify that I've never been diagnosed with any kind of mentall illness or underdevelopment, I've been perfectly fine unitl I hit 19, I'm 25 now. Yet for some reason, my brain's reward system doesn't function as it should for 6 good years now, and there's virtually no cause I could point to, only that things gradually got worse, then I lately managed to somewhat avoid falling into depression, but it's always temporal, because if I can't find something engaging that makes me happy, I'll stop caring eventually.

Because of all of this, I find it extremely hard to follow any kind of vision I have for my future, I'm highly antisocial, and though I have an endless list of interests, none of them hold my attention long enough for me to want to commit to them. Recently I gave up on my studies at uni because of this, I figured being broke while learning something I'm unable to picture as a future career sucks - but now I'm without that source of distraction, and I feel like I lost the last thread of covert satisfaction and I'm completely lost again.

&#x200B;

If there's anyone of you who've dealt with similar kind of issues, and especially if you've managed to beat it, I'd love to hear your experiences or advice. Stay safe out there and happy New Year!"

I've been depressed on and off for most of my life as far as I can recall. Throughout my teens I had this awful habit of sleeping until I physically couldn't do it anymore. 

A few years ago, my girlfriend cheated on/left me, and I forced myself to actually physically go to college. I made some friends, was on my feet a lot, and my depressive symptoms really did start going away for awhile. I even got a new girlfriend. 

Then boom, covid hits, I'm forced to go back home and get into my old routines. My new girlfriend breaks up with me due to the distance between us, I'm back to sleeping as much as possible, and the only real difference between now and a few years ago is that I'm older and more exhausted. Equally as alone, equally as hopeless. 

Although I'm not as suicidal as I was, but I can feel that urge creeping back the longer this goes on. The only real positives are that I got my degree and I'm about to start my new job, but I feel like that's gonna rob me of the chance to make friends like I did before. Life's just really hard right now."

The scars make it difficult to find a part of the skin I would like to place a new cut on. The scars remind me how hard it was to restrain myself from all those. I want to be how I was 1 year ago, trying to heal and trying my best to keep the negative thoughts at bay. I hate to look at the mirror. I hate to look at myself. I hate how I look in the photos.

I want a happy life, but I feel like my ""curse"" is keeping me from ever achieving it. I know it's possible to be happy and to achieve goals and dreams because I see other human beings having that happiness and living lives people only dream of, but I'd be a fool to think they didn't have any trials they've overcame or are still currently overcoming too.

I feel I have to keep myself in check because the only people who care about the depression and suffering I have to deal with on a daily basis are the ones involved and that's only myself. 

I can't get out of bed without having to do it only so I can pay my rent. I feel my issues caused me to stunt my growth emotionally at a young age and miss out on things I should have done or learned at my age(27), I feel like a young child trapped in an adults body. 

I'm fighting like hell to overcome my own issues because I don't want it to be a life of even more regrets than I currently already have and also I don't want it to keep being an excuse for me to not have the life I wish I did, I've been this way since I was a child dealing with untreated issues and I really really want to make improvements and changes and I noticed I do make some improvements over the years, but not at the rate that I'd like.

I am terribly sorry for this rant and for anyone who took their time to read the whole thing through, does anyone relate? I used to think I was cold and callus from feeling emotionally numb, but now I feel I'm handicapped because of it. 

I don't know if this is a huge factor into things but Im sure it's a factor but I had horrible child abuse growing up and being sexually abused horribly, I wish I opened up and asked for help that I need when I was younger to have stopped those things but I was young and didn't know any better, but I feel any point in life is better than not doing it at all.

I guess I just wanted to post the story of my shitty life in the void of the internet.
I don't even know if I will keep this reddit account or read the responses. And if someone I know irl finds this, meh

I've always been the kinda weird kid at school, it didn't help I was bullied in the first few grades. When I was around 12/13 I realized I was gay, although I didn't tell anyone at that time. I finished school at 18 (which is normal here in austria) and was having a little bit of hope that my life will get better, and it actually was for about a year. I decided to go to university and study physics. This went ok for a while until i realized it wasn't really what I wanted for my future. I struggled quite a bit later on until I finally quit university. I felt like I dissapointed my family and everyone when I failed that. I spend almost the entire next year sitting at home doing nothing except play games and such bullshit. I eventually decided to go studying again, this time computer science. I finished that and found a great job, and was finally having hope again that life would be better.

My family is not that big, I don't know who my father is amd grew up with my mother alone. Being an only child too didn't make that easier. Now all the fucking time I wasted in my 20s with being depressed and focusing on my studies, I lived at home. Then, when I finally got a job, I was hoping to finally move out and begin to actually live my life and not feel like a little child. The covid came and fucked everything up again. But the real hopelessness came when my mother had a stroke last year. Luckily, it wasn't that severe, but now I'm trapped in my fucking life again. I feel guilty when I would leave but I feel more and more depressed if I continue to sit around at home and feel like I never had my own life to begin with.

I have very few friend I pick up over the years, but never told them the truth about how my life is going. probably because I feel its fucking embarrasing to be 30 (almost 31 lol)
 and still live at home. I don't have a drivers license due to medical reasons. I have social anxiety. The once great job i had has turned into mundane bullshit that pisses me off most of the time.

 I don't know how long I can take it anymore. I have a rough plan for killing myself but I'll probably be a bitch and not go through with it anyway lol. It's new years eve and i'm sitting hgere alone writing that while listening to pink floyds comfortably numb. At least it felt kinda therapeutic writing this wall of text. Was invited to a party but was too stupid to got because fucking social anxiety. I'll just get drunk now and watch some movies or youtube, idk. I hope next year will get better but I doubt it. 

If your read all of that thx I guess

I hope that whatever dark hole you are in you'll get out of. I've basically given up hope on me but all the best to you

goodbye"

I can’t afford the emotional anguish of screwing everything up and needing to start again with nothing and no one. Sitting in silence seems better than that. It’s just that everything feels so distant at this point anyway… But I can’t keep doing this to myself either. What the f is wrong with me?"

rswj2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rswj2y/my_psych_ward_experience_during_covid19/,My psych ward experience during Covid-19,5,1,1640965258.0,"I want to start by saying my experience was probably unique, if you or a loved one is being admitted do not assume my experience will mirror your own. 

After a couple of phone calls with the mental health crisis hotline in my area, I decided to go to my local emergency department. Long story short, they decided I should be involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric ward as I was potentially a danger to myself. 

Fast forward to my first morning there, a new patient gets admitted to my room (4 beds total in the room). No worries, she stays in bed all morning and I go about my day. Shortly after lunch, I am told that I have to immediately move rooms. Turns out, our new roommate tested positive for Covid. They were swabbed prior to admission but I guess the results didn’t come out until that afternoon. After some confusion among nursing staff, it’s decided that those of us who are exposed are to be locked in private rooms, not allowed to leave, for 10 days to self isolate. 

That meant 10 days of no group activities, not talking to anyone at all, no contact with the outside world whatsoever (electronics were forbidden and we had no phones in the room). We didn’t even have clocks on the wall to tell what time it was. 

I was told I couldn’t leave my room to shower, make phone calls, even go for supervised walks outside. Our rooms were too small to walk around or do any kind of exercise, and there were no tables or desks or anything so we were essentially forced to sit in bed to eat our meals and hang out all day. 

My psychiatrist wouldn’t even come into my room or bring me to a private area, he stood outside of my door and I had to loudly explain my feelings to him despite other patients walking by, hearing everything. 

The first night of our isolation I had a full meltdown. I was very stressed about my predicament and wound up having a full panic attack. Another patient helped me through some breathing exercises while several nurses and a physician were in the vicinity and ignored me. One nurse rudely told me to get back into my room (I was standing in the door way) and none of them tried to help or bring my nurse over. My isolation meant I had no way to tell my nurse I needed help. Our rooms had no call bells or anything and I wasn’t allowed to leave my room to go to the nurses station. I stayed in my room panicking until my nurse did her hourly walk around and noticed me. Rather than doing anything to actually help, I was offered a sedative and told there was nothing else they could do. 

I ended up demanding to be discharged the next day (which the psychiatrist was surprisingly ok with) but that was after I had to spend a substantial amount of time in forced isolation and I never even received any psychiatric help whatsoever while I was there. No coping strategies, no diagnosis, no assigned psychiatrist (I saw two on call psychiatrists during my stay). 

All that for an experience that was extremely dehumanizing. I wasn’t allowed to wear my own clothes,  I had to sit in my own filth, I couldn’t take a walk or do anything, and I was treated like a diseased animal because of an exposure that was their fault. One of the nurses that ignored my panic even tried to gaslight me and my family when we brought it up after the fact. 

All this to say that the fear of Covid was prioritized over my own treatment. I left the facility worse than when I came in. Now I have new fears and the sense of isolation and anxiety have persisted despite me having been home around people for at least a day now."

I've never been an angry person, and I think I have some real issues around it because being angry makes me feel sick, it turns to crying immediately and often leads to anxiety attacks, I don't know how to process the emotion, and the only way I can really stop feeling It is to either decide to feel nothing and sit there feeling numb, or to sleep it off, which means I could be taking multiple naps during the day.

But fuck man, all NYE is to me at this point is a reminder that the years are ticking by and everything keeps getting fucking worse. Not even talking about the virus bullshit, my shit was still well and truely fucked back when Corona was just a beer. Guess it hasn’t fucking helped anything either though.

Didn’t think I’d feel more shitty than this time last year. Spent NYE last year trying to drink myself into an early grave and doing rails of coke someone I’d never met gave me in a bathroom. First memories of 2021 were spent being so fucking hungover I couldn’t stand up without feel like I was gonna pass out. But somehow, here is it, stone cold sober and it’s way worse. 

Every single year I feel like it’s taken every last thing I had, and every year the next year reminds me of what little I had left by taking that too. But thinking about what I lost in 2021 isn’t just depressing cause I lost it, it’s mostly depressing to think that those things were really all I had going for me. Depressing to think I was surviving on such fucking table scraps and even those were taken. 

Started the year with I job I fucking hated, but one that let me afford my shitty, cockroach ridden shoebox of an apartment so that I could live alone. It was a fucking gross apartment, but at least I was free in it. If I was still there I’d be blasting music over speakers rather than having to use headphone like I do right now. But I got way too fucking depressed to be able to work and had to move back in with my toxic fucking mother, just like always fucking happens when I claw my way outta here.

Moving back in with her cost me every fucking freedom I had. We got another wave of covid here almost immediately and since my mums such a paranoid control freak, she won’t let me leave the house (says she’ll kick me out if I ignore her and leave anyway), can’t go to the fucking gym anymore, can’t ever be alone cause her and her fucking husband are always here, she even opens my fucking mail “in case the envelope has covid”. It’s fucking ridiculous, I’m fucking 22 and I feel like a fucking teenager again.

Also had the last smouldering embers of my one and only friendship I’ve had this lifetime finally get snuffed. It was realistically treading water when the year started, but I guess I didn’t realise how much I still valued the once per months she’d text me outta the blue and the 4-5 consecutive replies I could get outta her before she was gone again. Been 7 months now. Knew it was officially dead when I didn’t get a “merry Christmas” text. She always used to send one. 

A day later the last of the two goldfish she bought me died. Didn’t think that’s bother me, I didn’t even fucking want them, specifically told her not to get them at the time. But again, it was just one more thing I had but don’t anymore. Probably all for the best though. Didn’t want the goldfish, knew when she bought they’d probably wind up being a reminder of a friend I’d lost. 

Fuck her though, she clearly wasn’t interested in being friends for months, glad she finally grew up and stopped checking in each month. Probably only did it to make sure I wasn’t dead, guess all it takes in one little suicide attempt and all of a sudden people feel the need to fucking put you on life alert at all times like you can’t be trusted to take care of yourself. Can’t wrap my head around why she’d fucking bother anymore though, she pretty clearly didn’t fucking care to spend any time or even really talk with me while I was alive last year, so why the fuck does it matter to her if I was dead? 

So yeah, 2021 took my last few freedoms and autonomy, the last thing I had that even sorta resembled a friendship, my pets that I low key didn’t even want. Can’t wait to fucking see what 2022 reminds me I have only to fucking rip out from under me. Maybe it’ll finally be the year I get it all over with and kill myself. Not like I have anything to stick around for. Don’t fucking enjoy anything anymore at all. And my life is just gonna be a constant loop of moving out, getting my freedom for a while until my mental health cripples me, stops me from being able to work, and forces me back to my mum’s. Got no future anyway."

To make matters worse I hooked up with another coworker shortly afterwards and that failed almost immediately. It was pretty awful to see both exes almost every day at work and slowly but surely I ended up on extended sick leave for almost a year. Bunch of therapy and antidepressants later I quit my job and started looking for something new. Got accepted into a school I had dreamed about for nearly a decade, found myself a part time job I was happy with and a girlfriend I was very in love with.

After about a year of school I just had to quit. Afterwards I felt  really great and realized how much anxiety it had caused me. It was at this point that I decided to stop taking the antidepressants; after all, I still had a  loving girlfriend and that was all that mattered to me. We got married, had kids and bought a house of our own.

Everything seemed ok until she suddenly informed me this September she wants a divorce. I went through shock and all the typical emotions associated with such news but decided I wouldn't go down the same path I'd gone before. I seeked out help almost immediately, tried keeping myself busy and promised myself I wouldn't need the meds this time around. 3 months have passed and I find myself in a worse place mentally than in the beginning. Yesterday I had to surrender and  started taking antidepressants. She has said to me afterwards that I I relied too much on her to find happiness and I hate to admit it, but it's true. I was still happy all this time but being as codependent as I am has its major repercussions. F*cking hate the fact that in the end I didn't really learn anything from my previous battle with depression."

This is who I am and who I’ve been for years. I don’t know any different. IT WILL KILL ME. There’s no doubt about that anymore. I’m screwed up in the head. It goes deeper than being sad. I can’t take other peoples opinions if it isn’t “nice” even if it’s trying to help me. And for that I feel like I’m not normal. I feel not normal in MANY ways. I just want to never exist again. What’s funny is people don’t realize how close I am to ending things, and so when they treat me like shit, they don’t know the thoughts that go through my head in that moment.

Every one of my friends have partner or casual relationship while I'm 35 old virgin and it feel like I'm such a failure. I just never been loved, even in childhood my mother often told my that it would been better if she made a abortion, I think mostly it was due to breakup with my father and struggling financially.

I in my early 20 I  thought that I don't deserve a partner, so I tried to better myself, worked, acquire degree in CS, etc. Now I'm financially stable, have my place, workout but it looks like I still don't deserve a partner in my live. When I get reason of why they reject me, it often comes to my lack of experience in sex and relationship at such old age. It isn't what I can fix, so it seems that all is lost. I tried to go to therapy, but I just quit when we discussed relationship, and I confessed that I never had any success with women, she started laughing about it and told ""How? It's soo easy, I can just go and have sex with women in no time, and I even don't want it."". Then she bragged how she constantly get approached by women. She also shared this in group chat. I just can't hear stories from people how it is easy to find someone at least for casual sex, it is panful to see couple everywhere. I'm soo jealous of people who have this easy, for me it is just impossible, I can't do this even to save my live. I keep trying dating, but it never works.

I am on two antidepressants, highest dose of one of them (200mg sertraline). Two antianxiety's, an antipsychotic, and other meds for other diagnoses. And I still feel this horrendous doom. Lots of my depression symptoms are less severe, but this doom never goes away or improves really.

All the time. Except brief periods of maybe.....1 minute or 30 seconds every few months or once a year where it dissipates partially and I see...there is a point, after all, I have motivation, and that doom, that cloud, is almost gone.

And then it comes back. And while the black cloud is up, I see life differently. And I forget how I felt when it was gone for 30 seconds one year ago or so. I have many things I want to do in the world. I'm in college. I love certain things, like dance, art, law, human rights, etc. I am a very passionate person, don't get me wrong.

But I can't truly focus on anything to get good enough grades, to make a solid plan for my future, to decide where to go and what to do for graduate school, **solely because of this doom cloud.** It has ruined my ambitions and my future. I have lost many years to it. I want to do things, but this cloud stops me because it says although I would love being a lawyer, dancer, artist, writer, I would love making a difference in this world, it says there is ultimately no point because 1. it took so much work just to make myself a good person, there are not enough good people on this planet so even if I make a difference when I die it will all dissipate and go back to how shitty it was and 2. many years from now earth will burn up anyway and 3. there is just no point, the world is full of evil people. 

So I procrastinate. I don't get anywhere far. Because of this feeling that almost never lifts. Which I believe is my depression.

How the hell do I fight this shit away and feel motivation?"

He is very smart, loving, and craves social jnteraction much more than I do. Last year, he applied for master's in Canada which is half a planet away from me. I plan to apply but with all the processes it will take about 2 years for me to get there. My boyfriend was a very extrovert and sociable guy back in his homeland. Now, due to new environment, he feels very isolated and I clearly see all signs of depression in him. He no longer enjoys things he used to, no joy for the future and even talking to me doesn't help him anymore. Honestly, I run out of words when he tells me about how he feels.
There are some guys who live near him which are from the same country as him. But he can't even mingle with them 'cause they all got their girlfriends and go partying without ever inviting him.
So now, my boyfriend who was very well-liked and sociable in his own country, is very isolated and depressed in the new country. Worst of all, he says that even *I* don't cheer him up anymore. He says he only needs social connections and hugs, and I'm not there to provide.
I feel very helpless. Even when I try to offer solutions he says he doesn't want to hear any. I tried things like watching movies at the same time to feel some connection, didn't work. I ask him to talk and he only says a few words. And for christmas time, I guess the university's councelling must be closed for now.
I would really appreciate if you could offer me advices. Thanks

Edit: I created this account to post this, because he sometimes checks my main account."

It has been almost a whole year since my world turned upside down. I am what I would consider a successful 27 year old female who has a masters degree/was pursuing another one, and a good support system. Last year around march I had a traumatic event occur post surgery that left me crippling panic and anxiety that eventually led to severe depression. I was bed bound for months and then put on an ssri to help. Within a month of taking the ssri i developed severe intrusive thoughts that led to a diagnoses of OCD (pure o). Since developing this diagnoses my life has been practically a living nightmare since. I have been in therapy for almost 8 months with an ocd specialist and doing everything i should be doing. I am trying to get back to
Working full time and recently I have been driving and getting out more. Yet every day I wake up the intrusive thoughts are the first thing to greet me. Even on my good days they are always there to remind me of my life now. Every week i break down crying as some days my thoughts are almost unbearable. I am also currently tapering off my med due to developing ringing ears, sexual dysfunction, etc and this is clearly effecting my emotions. I am doing it very slowly too. Yet it seems like i cant win. Most days i just want to sleep all day and do nothing. Half the time i just wish i had my old life back and could wipe some of my memory. My ocd themes also cause me intense guilt and shame thus making me more depressed. I find myself thinking i dont deserve to live and that i am a monster because of my thoughts. I just want to be a good person and have a “normal” life. I just don’t know how much longer I can deal with this. I know I will always have ocd andI have done pretty much everything that i can to help treat it but it doesnt matter. Trying to fathom the rest of my life with this scares me so much. I love my family and friends but i still feel constantly alone because noone truly understands. I feel like i am fighting a battle with myself everyday inside my head but can never win. I just want a break. I am tired of crying, tired of being a burden, tired of having to fake it for others, and just tired of fighting. I am mentally exhausted and i just want it to end. 😪"

I've been in this role 7 months and the best I've done is this month where I hit 45% of quota. (Our whole team has been doing terribly for a bit but I've never even made it in the top half of our team for monthly performance, so I'm consistently in the bottom half of a badly performing team.) I had one scheduled call with a prospect today to try and get this deal closed by end of month, and I got the contract signed, but I feel like that's in spite of our call as opposed to because of it. I got nervous and stuttered and had a hard time understanding & responding to their questions. I think the fact that they were already very familiar with our software before I had ever talked to them is the only thing that sold them. I constantly worry that I'm going to get fired for underperformance and I have a hard time not stressing about work when I'm not working.

In the group chat with my friends they were talking about playing Warzone later tonight around 10pm and I said I was down. Dicking around on my computer after work around 4pm I saw them all on Discord playing Warzone which I didn't know they were doing. Sometimes they hit me up to play and sometimes they don't. I joined the call and we played 2 games I did terribly in, in the Discord call I made plans with those same friends to play again later tonight. It was like 4pm and we had talked about playing around 10pm. At 9:30pm I texted the chat to make sure we were still on and nobody responded. I had also joined our Discord voice channel to see if anyone would hop on but nobody did. At 10:20pm I saw one of those friends had joined a separate Discord voice channel and was playing a different game with someone else. Those voice channels are in the same Discord group from our school and isn't particularly big so he definitely would have seen me in the other voice channel. At midnight that friend finally responded after the other person and said he was down to play. We played a couple rounds I also did terribly in. Sometimes I'm good at Warzone, when I play by myself I usually have a good KD, but when I play with friends I get anxious about performing well and end up doing terribly. I constantly get anxious that those friends don't like me and think I suck at the game. Why did nobody mention in our group text they were all playing Warzone earlier than we had discussed?

I have several texts from other friends from over a week ago that I haven't responded to for no real reason other than that I forgot. At this point I'm too embarrassed to respond and thinking about those texts eats away at me each day.

I have several bills that have been overdue for months, I'm definitely not rich but I have the financial means to pay, but I haven't paid yet. I'm too afraid to check the status on those because I know they'll be covered in late fees. The doctor visit one is probably fucking my credit too and I'm too afraid to find out how.

I can't keep anything clean, my apartment is always a disaster. Dirty dishes and trash are always over my desk, coffee table, even floor sometimes.

I'm addicted to kratom and vaping and hate the amount of money I spend on those things but I don't have the willpower to stop. I consume 5 glasses of kratom per day and will run through a 4-pack of Juul pods in about a day, which I realize is a shitload of nicotine and probably terrible for my health but I feel like I can't quit. I'm prescribed Adderall for ADHD which I take on work days, bu I still struggle to get my work done. A year ago the ARNP I see for ADHD told me that 5G causes covid and ever since then I wonder if she's a quack, if I even have ADHD, and if I'm just fucking my brain up by taking Adderall. But I feel like I'm dependent on the Adderall to get work done now and I'm too afraid to find a new mental health professional because they might take my Adderall prescription away.

My parents are successful, my dad was literally a fuckin orphan and had a poor, abusive family growing up and managed to become quite successful. Meanwhile I had a nice middle-upper class upbringing and now I'm squandering all of it. My friends are all in programming jobs while I cold call people to buy some software for a living. I make similar amounts of money to them, but I'm constantly jealous that they're actually building things and being productive while I'm just harassing strangers to buy shit. I took a bunch of comp sci classes in college but I didn't get into the major, and honestly don't think I would enjoy programming for a living either. I actually can't think of any job I think I would enjoy doing full time. I feel like I'm going to be on my death bed looking back and realizing I've contributed nothing to the world.

Anyway thanks for reading my tangent, some days are better than others but today I've been having one of those days where I feel like I'm not good at anything and nobody likes me."

TW : harassment

It's really hard for me to go back home during holidays. My mother can't do anything but belittling me, telling me I'm taking bad decisions, shaming me on the way I do nothing of my days. I can't afford it anymore, every second I have the feeling that my chest is going to explode, that I'll start crying and making panic attacks. I don't know what to do.

I often lean on my girlfriend, but these times are hard for her too, I can't ask her to be there everytime I don't feel well. I have suicide thoughts all the day. I don't know what to do anymore. My medication doesn't help me I'm totally lost. I just need help but don't know where to find it. My friends are kind but I don't feel comfortable enough with them to talk about my depression. If you can bring any help, any idea, please do it. Thanks for reading me."

I don’t go to school or have a job this year due to how much I was/ am still struggling, but I’m slowly feeling better bit by bit. I struggle a lot in feeling like it’s ok to just let myself rest and not really do anything productive because I compare myself to others a lot. I’ve only talked to one person who also has depression and they applauded me for what I’m doing and made me feel validated. However whenever i talk to my best friend who is constantly keeping herself busy and constantly doing productive things even over breaks, I feel like she doesn’t really understand and I feel a bit judged. I feel like people were so much more understanding and kind about my mental health when I was still in school. Now I feel like people just see me as lazy or unmotivated when I’m actually just trying to get a will to live and interest in school back by resting. I’m so tired.

Having Depression completely changed my life. I used to be so extraverted and such an outgoing and positive person! Then It hit me out of nowhere and now I’m extremely introverted and barely leave my own house. While anxiety just makes me need so much reassurance and clouds my mind. Both depression and anxiety are just terrifying to have at the same time, but of course with the help of antidepressants (Prozacs to be exact) I can finally feel myself getting better (: I’m more out of my room and more active just moving around more. I used to be glued to my bed and just wanting to stay in bed all day but now I’m able to wake up and feel refreshed that I’m alive for another blissful day. Prozac really helped me feel like my old self again, a stronger and better version of my old self. The journey with antidepressants isn’t easy as you deal with difficult side effects but PATIENCE truly is key when it comes to being on these types of medications. I trusted the process and I’m finally getting better. I’ve been one them for about a month now and I’m just so glad to start feeling myself get better, and I of course wish the same thing for all of you reading, wondering if it’ll get better, trust me IT DOES, be patient with it ♡ and if you’re reading this and still haven’t reached out for help yet… what are you waiting for? Do it, don’t be afraid! Talk to friends, close relatives, family, or even find yourself a therapist! I used to be so deep in a hole until I reached out and checked myself into a mental clinic. Don’t be ashamed to go through these types of things, embrace them! Having these emotions are what makes us human. And trust me, once you reach out for help it’ll feel so much better. Keep trying, don’t give up ♡ Know your worth and know that you’re all meaningful and have a purpose here♡ Keep on fighting! We all got this <3"

I don’t want to commit suicide. I don’t want to hurt my family like that. But I’m also realizing, that there’s more than one way to waste a life. And I hate the idea that 10 years from now I’m gonna still be like this. That I’m still gonna be this person that I hate so much.

It just hurts that I'm so alone. I know, I should be happy as my own, my life shouldn't be dependent on others. But everyone is happy with someone else. I'm not even talking about romantic relationships, those are way out of my liege. Do I have friends? No idea. There are some people whom I talk with online sometimes. But is this really friendship? We met once, but that's all. Everyone already has friends and even if they think I'm a friend for some reason, I'm way low on their priority list. I mean, I'm the one who always texts everyone, nobody ever texts me first. I know that I'm a bitter and negative person, but I'm lately trying to keep all these negative feelings to myself, because nobody cares. If they know you are fucked up, they will just distance, and leave you alone in the darkness. This always happened to me, why would it suddenly change?

I don't even know what I want. Happiness, probably. My dreams can be more realistic than seeing myself happy. But what could give me happiness? How can I make my life be better?

A little backstory. I’m currently 17 and have been depressed since I was nearly ten years old. Moving on because that was a descriptive “backstory” haha. 

I swear in this life I’m meant to have fun. I would do anything to go out and club every night and meet people, to have quick witted conversations that don’t leave me feeling guilty afterwards. 

I am young, obviously.. and didn’t experience the parties of early 2000’s, but there’s something in the music that makes me feel at peace in a way and somewhat content, and that if I’m in a club somewhere with music like that.. it would be amazing. 

Y’all seen project x? Well, if you have I can stop there and you see where I’m going (at least the good moments.) I just want to do all of these things and I know if I never get help or help myself, I’ll never get close to it. It’s mainly the social anxiety and lack of confidence that keeps me away from people and I’m sure depression fits in there somewhere, but lol… this party life/living in the moment is what gives me hope.. to be happy in the moment, to be able to look back on the memories and actually feel good that I was living.

But does anyone else feel this way too? 
That you keep missing out on the fun, and that you actually want to live and experience everything, but mental illness is consuming to the point it prevents you from doing it?"

I stay up till nearly noon and sleep through the day. I can't sleep early at all, I can't force myself to stay awake for until a better time to fall asleep, I live most of my days during a time where everyone is asleep like a vampire.

I hate it, even though I'm technically being productive by working on my comic, I lost my job and car so I barely have any job options. When I finally get money from unemployment, I'm pretty sure I'll just have most of my groceries sent to me and I'll slowly not leave the house.

 I don't really have a reason to live outside of making art. There's a ton of things I could do to get my life on track, but I just can't, I don't have the reason to. My dad wouldn't understand if I told him that I  just don't have the energy to live, he didn't understand when the school had to call him and told him I was having suicidal thoughts. Maybe my art and comics will take off, I already have people that like my work, but I just don't have the energy to do anything else. The side of me I put out when I'm around people cares, but deep down inside, I can't help but wonder why does anything even matter? 

But I just can't die yet, no matter how down I am, there's this side of me that wants to see things through. I tried to pretend that I don't care if I die, but I do, I'm scared to. It feels like I'm dragging myself around and it hurts, but I'm scared to die. I can't help but to feel like pouring my life into art is a bad thing, like I'm making some mistake. 

My mind's a mess... every since I had a panic attack a few weeks ago, all I've been able to do is write. It's like my hands are moving for me even though I feel so conflicted inside."

I haven’t been diagnosed with depression but I would argue I’ve suffered from symptoms since I was 11. My mothers side of the family has a long history of depression, suicide, and attempted suicide so I wouldn’t be surprised if that played some role in it as well. I think my major problem is that I don’t feel any ambition, drive, and my emotions feel very dull. Things that should and used to make me feel both good and bad very rarely do so as much as they used to. I enjoy shooting guns with my dad for example but I notice that it doesn’t feel as fun as it once did and if I do it alone it’s almost a waste it feels. I do feel guilty though, as an only child my parents have spoiled me and I’ve always felt extreme guilt over it. I have a lot of things most 23 year olds don’t have, a machine gun, a ton of expensive guns, several acres of land, and an extremely easy life. I wouldn’t say I think life is hard, but I don’t think it is worth the pain or trouble of suffering for something. I assume this is because I don’t receive as much enjoyment or pleasure from things so why put more effort in? I think my guilt is in that I feel like an absolute waste of these things and although I know my parents are proud of me and love me immensely I feel like I’m not worthy of anything they give me mostly because I feel it’ll be wasted on me. I have a lot of self hatred for myself too, granted I have tried to take good care of myself by losing like 111 pounds a few years ago and keeping it off. I think that I truly just feel that I see what life is about and don’t really want anything so it’s not worth it. I have friends but they live somewhat far away and really my dad has been like a best friend. I fear that when my parents die (they are in their early 60’s only but I just don’t think I’m going to disconnect from them anytime soon) based on the current trajectory I’d be pretty much alone most of the time and really have no purpose at all. I guess this is my way of anonymously seeing some help because I destroyed too many friendships trying as a teen"

I thought it would be interesting to share the emotion of this.

“(This is a warning for a pretty deep and dark, but hopefully, an ultimately uplifting post.)

As this year draws to a close, and the decade ends, I’m spending a lot of time reflecting on the experiences I’ve had and the people I have met. 

This last decade has been nuts, and I’ve met some amazing friends, and had some incredible experiences I’m so happy for. 

I’ve also had some of the worst experiences of my entire life. 

I’ve been homeless, had several medical issues, lost many friends, had an irreparably broken heart, had some life ruining drama, and just struggled to survive and cope with existence. 

This last year especially, however, I’ve had some of the best experiences of my life. 2 of the best days of my life happened this last year. Days I never could’ve fathomed would exist, and I’m sure I’ll never share anything like them again. And I’m so grateful for those experiences. 

I’ve also experienced a lot of pain and hurt that I’ve been struggling with. Life long pains in my mind and heart, deepening depression and worsening anxiety compounding with each passing day. More people leaving me and turn against me, pushing those I love away from me, and watching everyone else speed ahead in my life, while I’m still stuck in the same place as I was 10 years ago, and my mental health even worse than it was 10 years ago. 

(I’d like to place another warning before this next part because I’m really spilling my guts here. Not to scare, worry, or look for sympathy, as my point of this post is hope.)

As my depression has worsened, I’ve found myself contemplating suicide nonstop every single day, and worsening over time. Even attempting twice last year alone. 

I’m very grateful I did not succeed.

Moving into 2019, the anxiety worsened. The hurts cut deeper, and I could only find myself wishing I had succeeded. 

“Next time I’ll do it right.” I’d tell myself. 

So I made a promise to myself:

“By the end of the year I will kill myself. No exceptions. No half measures. I will make sure it’s done and done right. And I will live this year as my last big one.”

And with that promise under my belt, I experienced such great times with some amazing people that I wouldn’t give for the world. But the time ticked down and drew closer. 

Every time I found myself thinking: “Well, maybe I won’t have to do that?” something would knock me back down a peg. 

As these last few months came around, life did it’s thing and kicked me while I was down, but it shadowed over me with this impending doomsday clock I had set for myself. Every minute ticking away. Drawing closer to the inevitable. 

I really struggled with coping with what I needed to do. And multiple times I would get up to go through with it, only to get knocked down into tears. Scared. Terrified. 

Not of the end, or hurting people, or what comes after. But of the physical pain I would feel in the process. 

Such a selfish fucking thought. But I didn’t care. 

Nothing helped. I turned back to self harm, like an idiot. I stopped taking care of myself. Overeating and gaining 13 pounds. Failing to exercise. 

“Maybe this is why people do drugs and drink?” I kept asking myself. 

I’ve never done drugs. Ever. Not even once. Never even smoked a cigarette, vape, or a hookah. How the fuck do I cope?

With that, you probably wonder why I’m talking about this. 

Well, as of the time of posting this, the year is about to end. The decade is over with. 10 years of my life, gone. Never to get back.

And I’m FUCKING HERE. 

And through hard work, perseverance, and the help of all my wonderful and amazing friends, I’m breaking that promise. 

And my mental health, while not perfect, is in the best place it has ever been, that I can remember. 

I’m seeing a counselor, I’m taking several natural medicines, my anxiety is under control, suicide rarely in my mind, I’m exercising again, I’m back on my diet, I’ve got a support system, a roof over my head, I’m self harm free, and now I’m moving into the new decade with the best broken promise I could’ve ever broken. 

I know I don’t feel it sometimes, but I am fucking STRONG and I am fucking PROUD of myself. 

Let’s move into this new year and decade with hope in our pockets and the bullshit in the past. 

Thank you so much, everyone. You mean so much to me and I want to personally hug and thank every single one of you for the wonderful life you’ve given me, and the hope to keep me still living it. 

Thank you. 

It really does get better. 

I can’t wait for the next 10 years.”"

It feels like I've tried everything to help me get out of this 3-year long slump. I first felt like I was losing myself in November 2018. I was 16 at the time. I didn't think it was depression, I thought it was just school - but I had never felt like the way I did before then. I was too scared to reach out. I turned 17 a few months later and that's when the self-harm started. Despite that, I still refused to self-diagnose because I thought it was all in my head. I never reached out to anyone until I turned 18. 

My parents were extremely unsupportive. I know they cared but they did not show it. My mom saw my scars and called me weak. My dad refused to listen to anything I had to say and tried to isolate me from my friends because he thought they were the problem. After that, I knew that I couldn't ever rely on them. 

I almost tried to kill myself for the first time in September 2020. I was 18. I had 51,000 mg of ibuprofen all counted in front of me in my bathroom. I don't know why I stopped myself but I did. My boyfriend at the time was extremely helpful. We broke up the next week. After that, I did not self-harm for a year. I was still very depressed but I managed to not cut myself for a year and  I was proud of myself for that. I got professionally diagnosed with clinical depression that October. I still wasn't okay, but I thought it was at least neutralized.

I was wrong. I tried to kill myself through overdose again a year later. This year - September 2021. I ended up at the hospital. It was a failed attempt. I wish it worked. 

I was connected with psychiatrists, referred to therapists, given medication, etc etc. My university denied my request to be put with a school therapist. They were backlogged by 4 weeks. I cannot take the anti-depressants they gave me because I am scared of pills now. The psychiatrists worked with me for 2 weeks and then released me from their care. 

NOTHING is working. I've tried everything. I just want to die. I do not want to be here. I am so, so tired. I wish I didn't lose myself so young. I feel like I've lost a large portion of whatever life I've lived to depression. I am so. so. tired."

 I hate almost every single thing about me… inside and out… I hate the way I see myself, the way I carry myself and how I let what other people think of me dictate the way I value myself. I push people away often but I constantly crave attention and nothing will ever fill that void it seems. I always grow interested in the most unattainable people and people that may never see me in that light. They say jealousy is an ugly thing and man so I wreak of it. I’m bad at sharing those I care about and seeing people get the attention and recognition i feel maybe I deserve eats me to my very core. I like to believe I have a big heart but I close down quick but will let people hurt me over and over again before I ever actually learn my lesson because I want to truly believe they will show me what I see in them. I wonder every day if it could be my last day feeling the pain I feel inside. Wanting to feel normal or at least a sense of it. I am what I deem beyond repair at this point. Mentally I’m exhausted and I think I make everyone hate me so quickly that they have no interest in even reaching out to me.. I put effort in where it’s been long past time to let go and I try so hard not to quit on people because I don’t want them to feel like I did when everyone left me on my own. I’m suffocating at times in guilt and in self hate that i think I don’t deserve any of the people that do remain in my life. I offer absolutely nothing to anyone why would they want to stay. 

I provide no benefit to them in any way shape or form and eventually just end up being a burden or wasted energy. I want all of the amazing people in my life to find whatever it is they are searching for but one day I just want my brain to settle. The anxiety to stop the depression to cease and the hate to be gone but I don’t think that will be for some time. I’ve earned these feelings and I’m scared with them for life and it’s sad and unfortunate that I’ll never be able to hold those back because I can’t keep them in check. Jealousy will eat me from the inside out and it’s over things that I’ve never even had or will ever have and for what… to hurt myself based off a fake scenario I created in my head… I feel so overwhelmed with every day life at times that it drains every ounce of energy and life force I actually have sometimes not only from me but I feel like I’m draining those around me and I wonder at times if I should just go ghost and give everyone peace of mind and let them succeed on their own and not interfere. Disrupting course and ruining the good things seems to be what I’m good at and I’ve just come to the conclusion that we are all good at something maybe this is just who I’m wired to be."

We lived in an average home until my dad decided to leave and my parents got divorced, he didn’t care what happened to us.

We had 4 animals at the old house, now they’re here and they have no space and are extremely annoying. Of course covid increases my frustration because my sister is irresponsible and goes to see her boyfriend in NY and I can’t sleep in a separate room. I have to go from room to room based on what everyone is doing in the house. My sister is always napping, so I can never even use my room. She and my mom are always using the living room and the dogs are always barking and running around or play fighting. I am very introverted and need alone time, and I can’t talk to my boyfriend on the phone without feeling like someone is listening. I’m so frustrated here, and can’t afford rent by myself and don’t really want a roommate.

I've been depressed since my teenage years. Nothing seems to be working out. I'm ugly, poor physique, no talent whatsoever (at least they're not working out), and feel out of place everywhere.   


Recently I had a break from my meds because of number of reasons, and I'm thankfully back on them now. My therapist is on leave, maybe I can talk to them soon, but even then that's not the only answer. I struggle to spill all my feelings and am afraid to bring some skeletons out.   


You see, I am quite religous, and I have faith things will get better, but still sometimes I want to just melt away. The worst feeeling is when I feel completely numb. At least when I am sad, I can cry. I can't even cry now - all I can do to alleviate the pain is make a demonic roaring noise with my face stuffed in, well a pillow maybe.   


I had almost given up on the idea of finding a partner, but now I feel as though I need someone by my side. Well easier said than done when you're the kind of person that no one will even cast a second glance at. In addition, it's hard to find people of my type.   


I live 11,000km away from home. Am I ungrateful? I don't know, I recognise all the blessings I have. But the depressions comes from somewhere deeper than having my needs met. My thoughts are tangled, and I am conflicted between what I want and my inner values.   


Everyone I know is successful in some way. I don't have achievements to make myself feel good. If I'm ugly and unpopular, at least maybe more career success will make me feel fulfilled?   


I am an N type personality, so really hard for me to live in the moment. I have had a friend ship me ""Power of Now"" buy Eckhart Tolle thinking it might fix me. But really, I don't know what to expect.   


A spiral of guilt, hopelessness, and self-loathing has me wishing for the end. I rarely understand why people say life is a blessing. I wonder how neurotypicals see the world. How the good-looking, popular, athletic, intelligent people experience life.   


I suck at everything, will probably never experience love again. I'm done with school, so where on earth will I meet someone? I want to move cities and start over again. Maybe that will help me. But then again, moving to a different city where everything is new might cause my anxiety to spike. Heck moving to a new neighbourhood recently was scary enough.   


I don't know guys, I'll just try to go and cry and pick up the pieces. Maybe I can take the new year day by day, baby steps, until I have things back in control."

Although she has severe levels of RA, she used to clean, be active, and lively, etc. but as the years progressed, she’s been unbearably negative and rude. She’s recently vented how she wants to kill herself and blames me and her kids for her not having already killed herself. I’ve gotten to the point that I want to leave the relationship because out of the 3 kids we have a 5 month old together, and not only am I tired of her behavior and purposely not making efforts/giving excuses to not get help, but I also don’t want our daughter growing up thinking her moms attitude/behavior is normal or acceptable.

When her two kids from previous relationships want to go play outside or go to parks, she gets annoyed with them and tells them no. I usually work 15+ hours a day at the hospital, and yesterday I watched out daughter due to no baby sitter. When my gf got home, she held our daughter for 5 mins then handed her back to me saying “here you go” and proceeded to lay in bed and watch tiktok/YouTube.

Am I being an asshole or am I being reasonable? I feel like on top of her lack of effort to get help, she’s lacking on being a partner/helping with the housework and baby care. I basically feel like I do everything.

Lastly, she had a breakdown after an argument arose and she admitted to noticing her changes, attitude, behavior, etc. but she just left it at her “feeling like we all deserve better than her”. Back in high school I was a nice guy, but when I’ve heard her say that 1,000 times, in my mind I said “you’re right, we do”"

Been married for 8 years and together for 9. She hit me with a dump truck of “I don’t love you and haven’t for a while” discussion a week before christmas. I never saw this coming as we’ve seemed to have an open and communicative relationship until then, but she just came out with it a few weeks ago.

The truth is I’m an alcoholic and have been harsh on our daughter the last few years, and I accept that I’ve had flaws that have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship, but she’s never communicated her feelings of unhappiness until recently…but she seems dead set that she doesn’t want to work on things and I genuinely want to change for the better not only for my family but for myself. I haven’t been my natural self for a long time but I want to change for the better to be who I truly am and to be a better father and husband to my family.

I love my wife and daughter more than anything in the world and all I want in life is to be a part of their family and to be happy. I feel like I’ve tried all I can but she doesn’t want to work on things and all I can do is do my best to change and show her I can be the man she wants in her life. I’m hoping against hope here and am trying to be better every day, but I just can’t seem to convince her that things can and will change for the better.

She’s the woman of my dreams and my soul mate, and this situation is absolutely destroying me inside. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated

I’m reading a book right now that recounted a fantasy of a girl who had lost her sister to a tragic murder. She spent the day on the beach playing volleyball and drinking beers with her late sister. Towards the end, she recognized it for the fantasy it was and cried in her sister’s arms to only have that one moment again with someone you lost that you beg God for. I cried. I haven’t felt something so emotional in a long time. For someone to put in writing what I could only feel inside. 

So have I built up such a tolerance that the emotions I’m trying to bury have snuck their way back in? Or are they finally staring to work? Or is it that someone has finally been able to describe that feeling you have inside when you have lost someone so close to you that you can never recover from? When will I ever find myself again?"

I have let a horrifyingly large pile of garbage grow in my kitchen. I haven't gathered it all up since the weekend before Thanksgiving. I have actual years of dirty dishes, in plastic storage tubs, that I moved between apartments. There is so much hair, everywhere.

I managed to stay employed by once weekly showers, work from home and good to excellent performance. It's kind of an easy job, it's a little fun. I've stayed up with my laundry, kinda. I always wear a clean shirt to work when I go into the office, and I take care of my hoodie/sweater so it's not dirty day after day. I present well, I guess.

This brings me much shame to admit. I don't feel human. It doesn't feel possible to feel human again, something's turned off. I'm on meds, 3 every day with a fourth as needed. We've tried a few meds too. I'm in therapy, have been for a decade at least, same therapist the whole time plus a variety of prescribing physicians. I've been at this point at least during the pandemic, but was declining to it prior to that imo. 

Am I alone here?"

It feels like I live in a prison of the mind, that I am buried alive. Everyday is a struggle. 

Every dream I have had and wanted to accomplished has been destroyed by this diseases. I see people who I have gone to school with accomplish all their dreams and have meaningful relationships and grow and I feel like I am the same place as I was 15. 

Basically since 15, I have been living my life like a recluse, with minimum contact with friends and exended family. I find it very difficult to be around people. 

I have gone to therapy before for almost 2 years and stopped  but was deemed okay and we stopped. That ended in 2017.  Recently I started seeing a psychiatrist after I had a breakdown at a family event.  He has been trying to help me with all my problems

This past week has been the worst with increased suicidal ideations and not having the will to go on.  

Out of all the people I have talked to no has ever been able to tell me whether there is a cure to this. That there are only coping mechanisms. Has anyone cured their depression, how did they do you all do it?"

So here's the deal I've posted here before both bad and good, but unfortunately this one is beyond bad.

This happened the end of 2020 this year, an old online friend who we were always close, yet she was unavailable came back into my life. Everything went normal and we started talking, playing games and everything was as if we were always in each others lives. We got close through the whole period of the beginning of 2021. I've always just for whatever reason felt like as the one who can this is someone I care for and I want to help if I can which I did. So we gamed and talked, and literally messaged everyday. We pretty much helped each other through the shit days and celebrated the happy days. On evenings we play video games with my ""best friend"" and another ""friend"".

Anyways fast forward a bit a few months (think it was april), she randomly went cold, not replying, not being talkative. I got soo confused. I don't know why. No reasoning, nothing. So I consulted my ""best friend"" and was like I don't know wtf. He says to me ""who cares, she's just a gaming friend"" then he goes on to say ""I get the notion that she's two faced"". Right then I was hurt, I was pissed, I believed in her and cared for her for her to just act it. So we're on group voice chat, she isn't there and basically call her two face. The other ""friend"" goes and tell her. Start of argument #1. She's mad at me; I'm mad at her. We basically don't talk for a week or so, meanwhile the other ""friend"" and her start to talk more.

We made up and things went on normal I guess. Just even though we were still close as before, I guess she replaced me with the other ""friend"". This guy well he likes troll. So anyways the following months went on like this. 

She was told something I said by said guy and gets mad at me and we fight and make up.

I get mad at her because of something I heard she said by said guy and we fight and make up.

Guy influences her to push my buttons, so I get mad and we fight and make up.

Until finally. I take some time away, stopped gaming, cause I was causing trouble for her. At this point we were not texting every day, we just have this 2-3 hour conversations every week. So yes I took time away until one day, She, the guy and another friend posted gifs on our discord sever (i have failed them, etc) and left the server (guy's idea)

So I didnt see it. She texts me the day after and literally just yelled at me. Then we talk and she wanted to pretend nothing happened. We fought and we kinda made up.

Anyways few days ago, ""best friend"" and guy came back in my life because she ""got a boyfriend and disappeared"" but then guy tells me some things that I get mad about and then I posted something to the guy and he tells her and spins it to her. So now she's hates me, I feel like I fucked up so hard that I lost someone soo dear to me :(.

I feel hopeless and I just try to do my daily duties without trying to break down and cry.

I don't know I just feel so down"
rsjhzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rsjhzd/no_matter_what_i_do_i_cant_make_myself_get_out_of/,"No matter what I do, I can't make myself get out of bed in the morning even if I'm awake. I just stay half-asleep for hours.",1,0,1640918974.0,"I set multiple alarms every day--the issue isn't that I don't *wake* up, it's that I can't *get* up. The only things that can make me get up are if something feels truly mandatory, like a flight (although I've missed numerous flights over the last couple years, which is really awful and something I wish I could change). Even if it's a class or a meeting or something like that that should be non-negotiable, my brain goes like, *""it's okay, you can just skip the shower and then you still have ten minutes...you can be five minutes late...you can be thirty minutes late...you can just skip the whole class...you can just lie in bed for the next three hours with no commitments...""*

I'm a college student, and I don't remember it being an issue in high school, so I'm wondering if maybe something changed over the last few years. In that time, I've gotten multiple head injuries, so I was thinking it could be some sort of neurological damage. It has nothing to do with the amount of sleep I get or what time I go to bed (for example, during the pandemic when I was trapped at home I'd easily get 12+ hours of sleep a night and still be like this). I take antidepressants but they don't seem to help. It's not that I'm tired, just that I can't get up.

This whole winter break, I'll get up at 4pm or so and it'll be dark out, or I'll get up because my mom needs me to help make dinner. If I absolutely have to get up, though, e.g. I'm going on a day trip with my mom, I'll get up and be glad I did. I frequently miss out things I want to do because I truly cannot make myself get up unless another person is physically making me. Even if someone calls me to wake me up, I'll answer the phone, then put it down and not get up. It's like I'm in this kind of eyes-shut-half-awake-lazy state where I can hear what's going on around me, but I don't feel fully conscious.

A strategy I use a lot is to sleep in a weird place, like my dorm lounge or a couch in another building. Recently I was sleeping on a beanbag in my dorm lounge as a strategy to try to get up before noon. I heard my dormmates talking all around me (about how funny I looked!) and still it did nothing to get me up.

I don't brush my teeth, wash my face, eat breakfast, or do anything that people are supposed to do in the morning. A lot of times I don't even change clothes. I just get up and go wearing the same clothes I was wearing before. I can't sign up for classes that are in the morning because I know I won't go. I've even been late to my *1:30pm class* because I'm not out of bed.

I was recently reminded how abnormal this all is when I was talking to a therapist and describing   how I needed to get up the next day (at, say 10:30am), and how I therefore needed to sleep on the floor of the conference room or something like that. ""Wait, do you not use an alarm?"" she asked incredulously. I had totally forgotten that ""normal people"" can just set an alarm and get up at that time. I explained how I will set dozens of alarms, going off for literally hours, and I'll just turn them off and stay in bed. Even if they're across the room--I'll just get up, turn them off, and get back in bed. Even if it's an actual alarm clock rather than my phone. Even if it's a friend calling me. Even if it's really loud.

Can anyone help me? Is this just depression? Why can I not get up? It's kind of ruining my life."

I struggle with paying too much attention to shameful thoughts. I was 23 when I had my child, and I love him to pieces of course, I just don’t think I realized the long term. Like most things. Always told to think before I speak.. and now being a parent to shed the perspective on me.. I get it.. I seem to not realize the effect of my decisions and that just makes things so much harder too. Nervous. And then there’s the thoughts about what if’s. Which all just seem selfish. Been called that before too. Then I look at how much I’ve been pushed to break some of the depressive cycles. Absolute reason to get up etc. I have some family support, but only goes so far and within work help. My kids dad just sucks. I keep thinking maybe it’ll change and things get better but in the last 5 years it’s been a series of inconsistent and him taking the part time/ excuse road.. and it weighs on me… I hadn’t realized I was signing up to do this alone. Or rather I never took the time to evaluate what I was getting myself into. 

I’m on meds, in therapy, taking it day by day. 

On top of my rant, because my child is an only, I don’t have many friends at least in person, building that up, and met with another single mom with a year up on mine, I thought she was cool and we clicked together, yet after a good handful of hangouts with our kids.. I couldn’t handle it. Kids were nuts. Jumping on her furniture, running through the house slamming doors, an almost constant of tattling between the two of them. Talking before meeting seemed our kids were in similar boats of behavior and well, too much. My son complained several times of him being mean, especially the last, the other boy has antagonized him to running and said on the first hangout and told my son not to listen to his mom.. last visit her son smacked mine in the face, they ended up showing themselves to each other, he was and always tries to either hit his turn in a game, draw on his painting, broke down his blocks… soo ugh. Ended up setting her up with my cousin at that too… and so when this came around the last time, I had already started to take space and Xmas came around and we had presents for each other and kids.. and my son told several family members how he was mean.. so I cut it off with her.okay sorry for the rant 😅 these thoughts and anxiety of the situations that have been playing out is weighing :/"

   I saw some old guy struggling to replace his tire. I was perfectly anonymous in my vehicle. There was no social pressure to help this guy out. I pulled over and replaced it for him. Looked like it improved his day a bit. I, again, didn't feel anything.

  When I say something hurtful to my wife, that's a big deal. My brain really cares about that.

He lives several hours away, and does nothing for me. I have many vivid memories of him being violent due to drug use. My life is super fucked, to say the least. 

       My grandma takes care of me. She allows me to sit home and be drunk all the time. She enables me, to be fully honest. My mother's mother allows me to be nothing and I hate it. But I accept it, because that's what I am. I am nothing. I am no one. I have zero ambition. I am done. 
     
       So I honestly did nothing about it. When I was 15 I thought I'd pick up a trade. HVAC. I failed out of the steam workers union for smoking weed, then kinda gave up on life at that point.
       I've been drunk pretty much ever since.now I've collected 4 duis, and I  have no interest.... there is no plan. No one cares. I only want to overdose and die, like my ancestors. Please, tell me why not to."

I saw it with my friend. It was a good movie, but every little spark of joy was just immediately cut off and I felt depressed again. When I got home I just laid in bed and listened to music that I didn’t enjoy. Then I watched an anime I didn’t enjoy. Then I went to sleep which I didn’t enjoy. I woke up late because I have nothing to wake up for and played video games(surprise surprise, I didn’t enjoy them). Every game I’ve found I haven’t enjoyed. I have all the tomb raider games which I’ve barely touched just sitting there, waiting for me to play them. It’s no different for the Batman Arkham games. I spent $40 on games just to sit there and look nice I guess. But hey it wasn’t my money so what do I care. I don’t have school right now so I just sit in my chair and be angry and sad. Whenever I have school I get bullied by spoiled rich kids or little hoodrats. I’ve pushed every friend I’ve had away from me. Everywhere I go I get bullied. I get bullied at school, even online I get bullied. The one thing I thought I was good at was video games, but Ive never been above gold in anything (which I get bullied for). Then I used to be good at school, but my grades are dropping and I don’t understand anything. I feel like I’m not good at anything and I’m being kicked while I’m down. I just really want a break from it all. I’ve thought about killing myself, but last time I did that I just ended up in a hospital and ended up hurting myself. The only thing that gets me away from it all is weed, but I hate being high for so many reasons. I hate school, but I hate being at home too. When Christmas came I was hoping it would help me, but I just woke up and felt indifferent. Normal people would say “Man, I wish I could go back to a couple years ago when everything was great” but I can’t say that. I was in and out of the hospital for so long I didn’t get a childhood, these past few years have been my first time experiencing life and it sucks. I feel like I’m stuck and there’s nothing I can look forward to"

But every fucking day feels like that scene in every war movie, where someone looks at all the death around them with that thousand yard stare. My eyes feel glassy all the fucking time and if I stop and stare for too long, my ears start ringing. I’m losing presence in my own body. 

But it’s fucking stupid. I haven’t been in a war. I haven’t just watched hundreds of people die, or fought for my life. I just woke up and tried to make it through to the end of the day. That’s not heroic. It’s something most people wake up and do every fucking day without batting an eye. 

Used to be I feel like I’d go through a range of different emotions, even if most of them were shitty and unhealthy. But for a good while now, I’ve just been in this weird state of mostly numb with the last embers of rage smouldering somewhere in me, but it’s too weak now to access now. Sometimes I listen to the right music and that fans the flames a bit, but more than anything that just makes me sad, realising that I’m too numb to even feel rage properly. 

I don’t even know why I’m still here to be honest. There’s no experiences I’m hoping to have, no places I’m hoping to go. I don’t enjoy anything about this life. I’ve isolated myself for years, so no people around to miss me. Seriously, no one. Only had one friend ever anyway. And that was such a turbulent, chaotic shitshow because of me that she doesn’t even talk to me anymore anyway. Made me realise friendships really aren’t for me at least. 

And relationships aren’t either, never had one, don’t want one. Sure maybe sometimes I want sex or honestly mainly just someone to hold, but I can’t handle all the emotional shit you gotta go through to get to that point with someone. Maybe if I could somehow skip the build-up, the getting to know you phase, straight to the part where you’re 100% comfortable with each other like you’ve known each other your whole lives. Skip straight to the part where we she knows me so well that she doesn’t need to ask me questions about my past. Where she knows I don’t wanna talk at all most of the time. Think it’s pretty fucking obvious to see why that doesn’t work and why I’m not ready for relationships. And hell, sometimes I can’t even handle the intimacy part that I claim to actually want, so a relationship would be a mostly negative experience for me.

Just sick of feeling like I’ve got a thousand-yard stare when nothing is even fucking happening to me. Kinda wish it would, at least I’d have a reason to feel like this. Daydream about getting into fights and losing so that I can feel something for a while, feel bruised and bloody and be able to justify feeling traumatised. Used to cut myself but I fucking hate the scars that left so I’m trying not to do that shit. Just fucking hate feeling so fucked just from waking up in the morning."

Bought three tickets for $6 and of course I didn’t win. I know my chances of hitting the lottery were infinitesimally small but for a short time I at least felt some hope. Of course now that hope has become soul crushing defeat and I am sucked back into my constant reality of loneliness and pain. I hope death comes for me soon. I want to be strong enough to end my life but I’m afraid of the unknown. I really really hope I die tonight. I really really fucking hope I die.
rsi1b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rsi1b6/i_cant_see_a_future_where_things_get_better_for_me/,I can't see a future where things get better for me,3,0,1640914584.0,"Throughout my late childhood and teenage years I've lived through poor housing, shitty neighborhoods, and poor schooling. I was a shitty student in my freshman and sophomore years. My attention was all over the place and I would never do my homework. None of the work was impossible to comprehend, but I'm a natural procrastinator. And I could never really pay attention to what was being said in class. With some cheating and some hard work, I graduate with a 3.3 GPA, and based on recent psat scores, a 930-970 SAT. I managed to get into university. 


Just to put a little cherry on top of my shit life sundae, I had an emotionally abusive father during my childhood. I wouldn't even say he was the cherry, he was the fucking ice cream. He destroyed my self esteem in my most essential years. I'm a worthless fucking pushover thanks to this piece of shit. I want to be clear, I'm not making excuses for myself because nearly everyone has *something*. But I've meet very few people who had similar experiences achieve a life of prosperity. And the few who do, usually have some talent, skill, or personality they can work to their advantage. I have nothing. People like me usually don't go on to live quality lives. Whether it's due to genetics or environment, we're likely to live in poor conditions until our deaths. Almost all of the poor living conditions I mentioned were the childhoods of both my parents. If the conditions are not to dissimilar, where's the light at the end of the tunnel? 


I look around my neighborhood, and I cringe when I see older people living in these conditions. This isn't a life I want. What's the point of living if all I'm destined to be is  a working poor slave? I won't even be one of the funny, confident working class wage slaves. 


I see the freshmen at my college slack off, drink, smoke. They come from great families and great wealth. Their lives are on an upward trajectory whether they put in hard work or not. They will be comfortable in the near future. No amount of hard work on my part will make it even possible to achieve a tiny slice of what they have and will achieve. This makes me incredibly angry and depressed. We cannot change our fates. it isn't their fault they're lucky. It isn't my fault, I'm unlucky. 



Whenever I talk to anyone about my hopelessness, everyone says the same thing. ""Hard work will set you free.""  When intelligent people say this, they want to feel good about their awesome lives and accomplishments. It's depressing for them to know that their success was largely predetermined from the start by conditions largely outside of our control. When average or dumb people bullshit me, they want to avoid a fact that will make them unhappy. This is completely understandable, it is a depressing thought that despite their best efforts they will never their dream lives. Everyone has an incentive to bullshit me, including therapists. If therapists recognize that I'm not wrong given what we know about social science, they acknowledge my life isn't likely to improve. If they believe that I'm wrong, they are bullshitting me and themselves. 



I don't want to be alive if I can't live comfortably in the future. I deserve ""hard work"" to work for me. I'm not naive about what my future holds. I wish I could just disappear."

They then just started laughing and saying I am not depressed because I always seem happy. I don’t think they understand that people can be depressed and still generate some sort of fake smile so they don’t look bad all the time. I mean this has probably been the worst year ever for me, for example I got covid and missed so much school work because of it so my grade fell hard, I lost all my close friends and now have no one to talk too, and I am lonely constantly. It’s really starting to piss me the fuck off, my parents are the type of people that are always fucking happy and shit and probably never felt sad in their lives.

They always nag me about getting a job even though I am in high school with nothing to pay and my dad has taken my shit because I won’t get a job.

I also cope with anxiety and depression so things are just hitting me a little harder.

I had plans for tomorrow. I was going to spend NYE with my bf and some of his friends and have a chance to forget the world is falling apart around me for just one special night and I was *excited*. I don't have many friends of my own, and the one's I do have are not close to me in location so most days I'm at home with my ghost of a roommate and either working or just hanging out.

But there's covid going on and it's spreading very fast and of course, when I saw my bf just before the christmas holiday, his roommate told us they tested positive so I went home early and have been keeping my fingers crossed for the health and safety of the household. I thankfully tested negative but for him, living with someone who tested positive is like living in a petri dish and so I just got word tonight that his other roommate tested positive so NYE plans are off. 

Maybe it's selfish but I'm heartbroken. I desperately didn't want to be alone tomorrow. My dog passed away some months ago and he was my only company when I'm in my apt and I'm still grieving over the loss, my work has been terribly stressful and my efforts to possible find a new job has kept me up most nights because there's so much to prepare (I'm in tech so interviews are thorough and require a lot of preparation), I'm alone more days than not, and I was yearning for an escape just for one night and be a little social with some new people and my bf but it fell through. 

Idk what to do now. I had just bought champagne when I got the text so I guess I'm just going to drink it by myself and I'm most likely going to be crying than celebrating anything. Idk who to reach out to either so I guess that's why I'm posting here. Idk what that'll get me either since while well wished can be made, it doesn't change the outcome of tomorrow. I'm just so heartbroken and I wish my bf would have at least said ""sorry I can't spend NYE with you"". It just hurts, plain and simple."

I think starting at the age of 9/10. My parents migrated during their teenage years to Europe. I have always been a really shy and vulnerable person. Learning that I was different was not an easy thing for me, because I didn’t understand what was wrong with me. My grandparents wanted us to have a good life without financial problems that’s why they migrated to Europe. Hearing jokes and being asked a lot about your own Chinese culture makes you wonder why being different is so ‘special’. I actually think there is more to this story other than feeling/lonely or disconnected from this world. I don’t have to be strong. I just don’t want the earth to be shaking whenever I am going outside and come in contact with people. I want to be true to myself and my way to do that is thinking about everything and asking myself why I feel the way that I fee now. But I just feel so weak and broken. A lot of people with depression feel like I do, they like to be in the darkness, because they are used to it. I was bullied during high school and I’m still in high school now, so that is really tough for me to return to that place almost everyday. I just would like all the emotions to overflow. Even though I always tell myself that I don’t want to live anymore deep down I know that I want to. It is a wonder that I came to this point, it truly is and God bless everyone who is still with me on this earth today. I thought I knew myself pretty well, but I think there is way more to me as a person and that discovering that is the way to get through my depression. For the earth not to be shaking under my feet. I made myself depressed because I realized that my life consisted of 60% bad memories and 40% good memories. Let’s see what those bad memories want to tell me and what relation they have to me. I don’t know where to start but it will happen. Because I feel broken and that is why I have the will to break this depression and the bad memories, not only by asking myself why, but also letting everything that I have just overflow, just let it all out, because there’s a reason that I feel this wat."

For a long time, I've wanted to become a Youtuber and do a whole animation channel. Because my parents limited my computer usage as a kid until now though, I never had time to really play with any programs. The only thing I could do was draw using old fashion pen and paper.

When I finally got my hands on my own computer, I started by making a Twitter fanart account, as a sort of training session for algorithm stuff. After a while, I started by creating two animatics and posted them on Youtube (they didn't get a lot of attention but that was fine with me)

Eventually I decided that I wanted to create something original. I heard that there were storytime animations so I thought I'd give that a try. So I wrote a script (that was the easy part), and storyboarded it. It would be about 7 minutes long, significantly longer than anything else I've created. But managing that, college and putting together a social life at the same time was too much for me.

Now it's finally winter break, I can finally work on this freaking animation. Or so I thought. Even though I have had all day so far, I'm still only trickling along, busting my ass to refine each and every panel (I draw in an anime style). Even when I have given up on the idea of a posting schedule entirely, I can only barely bring myself to do it

It's gotten to the point where I'm questioning if this is really what I want. Why do I want to do this? Why is it taking so long? Do I just not want to do it? Is it because I don't have a lot of experience? Am I taking on a project that's just too big? Am I just tired and burnt out? I don't know

I think I've explained my situation ok. I'm just not sure what's wrong and I don't know how to move forward"

rsey7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rsey7f/some_of_my_close_friends_just_really_triggered_my/,Some of my close friends just really triggered my abandonment trauma issues,2,0,1640905617.0,"Over the past few years, I've been building up a gaming community on Discord. So far, it's been going really well, and I have met some of the best friends I've ever had while building this server. The closest people to me are my mods in this server, and among them are IRL friends, romantic partners  and online friends that I have known for years. As a group, myself and the mods have been a tight knit sort of ""found family"" dynamic. I trust these people a lot. 

Other context: before I met/started hanging out regularly with this group, I went through a period of my life where several very close people I sincerely trusted left my life in traumatic ways. Like, telling me to my face that life would be better without me around. Of course this caused some lasting realtionship/abandonment anxiety.

Recently, one of the IRL friends has been exploring things they have found about themselves(no detail for privacy reasons). I support this friend fully in their journey and I want to be there as best as possible. However, after introducing this friend to the discord group, I had been fighting for a while some feelings that I was chalking up as just being relationship anxiety because of the shit from before this group. I was ignoring toxic thoughts in the back of my head that were telling me that since I introduced this IRL friend, everyone seemed to be getting closer with each other than they were with me. I ignored the anxiety that these people would do the same thing that the old friends did. 

However, I found out yesterday that the IRL friend made a server themed around this part of themselves that they are discovering about a month ago. And then proceeded to invite nearly everyone in the group but myself. And then everyone proceeded to hang out in there a lot and specifically keep it a secret from me. 

It wasn't even because the IRL friend wanted to hide this specific part of their personality either. I knew about that and had seen it several times before.

The friend that made he one who came to me about it, and they say that keeping it from me was anxiety inducing. And it's not like I'm mad that the group hangs out without me once in a while (I'm not that clingy lol). I'm just more upset by the fact that it was behind my back and secretive. 

Now I'm feeling anxious and overwhelmed just being around the group because I can't stop fucking thinking about how they all were part of this (except ONE person who got invited to that server just the day before me). They all still hang out with me and talk with me and send signals that indicate they care but I'm honestly just really hurt and idk what to do. I'm fighting an urge to just ghost before it can get worse."

The lifestyle change they force on you is brutal and unpleasant but that is the nature of the beast. Change, real radical change, will always be ugly and painful. You'll think it won't mean anything because nobody cares but really that's why it will mean everything.

A change, big or small, can only mean something if it's real to you. As I look into the face of discipline, I  doubt the meaning everyday but you know what? It's better to suffer and learn through this then to remain a passive realm of nothingness. Where no matter how bad I want fulfillment it never happens because I take the easy way every-time.  The truth is that discipline has sharpened my brain and made my world smaller. As my eyes narrow through the pain, who I am becomes brighter and clearer. Who I'm not becomes a distant memory.

In the back of my head, I have a vision of a me without a care in the world. I have a dream of me being able to smile everyday and I mean really actually smile because no matter how bad the world is, my shit will be together. When I exit training in 5 months and come home for reserves, I really believe that I'll be unrecognizable and there won't be a single employer or person that can deny my purpose.

TLDR: Life is full of road blocks, I simply picked a path that I know will provide if I keep faith."

The beginning of new year is always really hard for me. Ever since my mental health started declining 6 years ago, new year has been just a reminder how much time I have wasted doing nothing but being depressed. I've lived one more year which hasn't brought me anything but bad and next year probably being the exact same depression and being useless. Everyone around me seems so excited about new year and I'm just not ready to know I've wasted the past year on nothing and next year I'll have to still live with my struggles. I've lost almost all hope for better future. I also lost the only person who had been able to understand my feelings and had helped me through new year celebrations. Pretty sure anything i have written here sounds absolutely stupid but whatever.

 How do I get trough the start of new year? How to be just more excited about new year? How to not feel so horrible? Am i the only one who feels this way or is this normal?"

It’s so hard dealing with this type of shit, specially because I have to deal with my own anxiety and depression, but since I’m an only son I feel like I have to take care of her, and plus I have no family, they are all dead. I’m afraid that if I will let her alone, she will commit suicide, and my father has the same fear, but he always lets all the weight and responsibility to me. The worst thing is that I can’t blame them, or hate them, because I understand they’re background, but I just feel like I’m losing my life here, and like if I’m not allowed to be happy, like if they were taking all my energy.  Sometimes I even feel like things will be better if she finally killed herself, I know it’s a shitty thing to think or say, but it’s real. 
All of this background make me feel isolated when I talk to other, I just feel unfortunate, and feel like the other people have so much luck for not having to deal with all the shit I have. I just feel like I can’t sleep, I can’t breath, I can’t be awake, I just don’t want to be here.

Someone forced me here on this earth. I didn’t ask to be here, and if someone asked me, I would have said no. I wouldn’t hesitate to say no. If I can’t dictate whether I die, or whatever I get an abortion, or whether I’m allowed to drink at a certain age, why did someone get to dictate whether I be born? 

I can’t begin to tell you how mad it makes me sometimes… I mean…. I want to unalive myself all the time. Yet… the only options I have… are treatments that I have to pay for… in order to… “get better” or “Live with my disease”. So I can pay thousands and thousands of dollars for a therapist, to listen to me, to give me some coping mechanisms or whatever the fuck they do, and continue to go back to talk and chat about feelings that I can’t even explain?

I've disabled my social media accounts and I'm thinking about turning off my phone. I'm not an attention seeker, trust me I'm quite the opposite, but there are these moments where I wonder why no one checks up on me when I go AWOL. Today I've been feeling so unloved and unwanted and holy fuck, it's never gonna get better. I'm never NOT going to feel those things. I don't know what the hell I'm doing with my life anymore (I'm 22) and for so long all I've wanted was death. I've been suicidal for so long, I've come close a couple times and then I get mad at myself when I don't succeed but then I get scared when I think about what would happen if I did just end it all. I hate being me most days, other days I'm in auto pilot or if I'm lucky, I've disassociated to the point of not knowing what day it is. I can sit in my room for hours and 20 min would've passed but it'll feel like 5 min or 5 years. I can usually detect the moment my reality doesn't feel like mine as soon as my body starts to feel lighter. Everything around me just feels.. fake. And not only that, I can almost automatically start day dreaming about anything but my day dreams hold a strong grip on my emotions-I get so involved in the story I'm creating in my head that I can day dream myself into a bad mood. Shit I can day dream so much it's hard to snap myself out of it.

 Maybe this will be easier. If I can stop feeling bad for myself and asking myself why my friends don't check in on me like I do with them, then I'll be fine. But it's getting harder and harder to have to do this every fucking year, every fucking time I start to feel 'unwell'.

 I just want to feel NORMAL (or be dead)"

And since then I just can't shake off that sad or sometimes sinking feeling.

I just don't feel like myself anymore, I feel like im never truly happy since those 2 months.
I have suicidal thoughts that really really scare me and I thought I have OCD, because of all the violent(suicidal) images in my head.

I was and still am really really scared to go near knives because im afraid my brain is gonna go crazy and hurt myself to the point of death. And I try not to stay alone, because when I do I start to spiral into those thoughts and have a panic attack again.

I lost interest in gaming (I still game from time to time but don't get as much enjoyment as before), which was my favourite hobby one if the worst thing is that I feel really unmotivated.

I feel hopeless that im ever gonna feel happiness like before and that really really really fucks me up.

Anyway my New Years resolution for 2022 is to eat lunch, but I literally don’t know what normal people eat for lunch. Cold sandwiches? Salad? Those sound kinda gross but I haven’t really ever had to make daily lunches, since I could get it in the dining hall/ cafeteria in school and have been skipping it since then. 

The internet is full of bs like “roasted sweet potato and feta tacos” and other stuff that would take way more effort than I can muster. Any other meal skippers out there with advice and ideas for lunch? Breakfast is easier cause I can just grab a yogurt or a granola bar and call it breakfast."

I don‘t know who I am anymore. I‘m just losing my personality, my identity.

I‘m currently spending most of my time at home, with my family. I‘ve noticed that I tend to agree with their views and opinions. I‘m far too impressionable. And the same thing happens when I‘m with other people.

I just pick a certain side simply to get along and feel included. I think that‘s the main reason why I am so impressionable. I have zero self-confidence, I always question my decisions and I need both validation and acceptance. Or maybe I'm just stupid, or coward.

Now I have to make an important decision. My family wouldn't want me to do it. Yet they say I'm free to make my own choice. I’m even 18+ years old so I ought to choose freely. But I can’t, I eventually ignore this decision since that’s what they want to. I don’t know if that’s because I’m fearful of their judgment, or because I want to feel more accepted.

And I’m sure that if my family wanted me instead to make this decision and I didn’t want to, then I would end up doing it because of the same reason. And not just my family, but someone else too (for instance a group of friends).

I have no idea at all and I’m really tired of this. I’m a true coward. I’m stupid. I’d love to make that decision on my own, but I’m unable to do so. I feel paralyzed and I also feel like I’m losing my own identity. I don’t know what I really want anymore. I don't know if I have to blame myself, people who surround me, or whatever. I just don’t know, I feel so confused and tired.

I feel like if I try to fix it in the ways that it can be “fixed” it is going to seem patronizing and pandering. I just want them to know they are more important than what the issue was (essentially me getting recognized for something at work that was a team effort. Even though I shared the acknowledgement and spotlight with them, the “reward” isn’t something I could share if I wanted to so I’m likely just going to decline it altogether. If my coworkers and I can’t share the reward I’d rather not have it). This seems really trivial now that I’ve typed it all out, but I just really hate myself right now because I just like to enrich peoples lives - help them achieve their goals, make them laugh… help however I can. And now I’m the guy ruining other peoples days and I hate it."

I always had a very low self esteem in terms of thinking I'm ugly and noone can be attracted to, not only because of my looks, a lot of people told me that I'm good looking or at least ""decent looking"" but I dont feel like that, I have a sunken chest, its not that bad it doesnt affect my health but I dont like how it looks so i never take my shirt off, even my best friends dont know that, besides i feel like a boring person, dont really talk much and sometimes it feels like people dont want to hang out with me because of that, everytime I'm with a friend there has to be someone else that draws attention of me. I've never had a girlfriend, I never had sex 

The worst part is that i feel like i don't deserve being depressed, i've always had an easy life, never really had to worry that much about anything, when i was 2 or 3 years old my fathers divorced and left home with my mother, that was probably the only time in my life where we had money issues, my mom worked a lot and did everything so we could live as best as possible and i Will forever be grateful with her for those things, but She was working most of the time and i was left alone in my house or when i was younger someone would come to take care of me for a while. I started living with my father when i turned 13 mostly for convenience, he lived just a few blocks away from my school and i had my playstation there, he's always been relatively wealthy but he never really cared about being a good father, he provided to the house but he never taught me anything, never asked me how i felt and i feel like he's always being ashamed of who i am, everytime we have discussions he says so many bad things to me, making me feel ashamed like I'm not good enough for him. I don't have a job and i dont want to work but I have to if i want to get money and live alone and that fucks me up, it's like im just not made for living and i dont know what to do, i've been thinking lately of ending it all, I know I'm weak. my dream is to have a rock band and live with my music but I don't know if I'm good enough for that.

And I am just as much to blame for it all. People say that only you can determine how others make you feel, and maybe it’s true. I let people walk all over me. I was good, kind, loyal, loving, forgiving, supportive. I was present. I was dedicated. I was committed.

rs7sml,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rs7sml/cant_unmask/,Can’t unmask,2,1,1640887084.0,"I’m so tired of being depressed. I’ve gotten so good at masking that sometimes it feels like maybe I’m not actually depressed. But then I sit down alone and it all comes flooding back. I don’t know how to be vulnerable or ask for help from parents because I’m 1. embarrassed 2. Angry at them for ignoring all of my cries for help my whole life. (Told one of my friends I wanted to kms in high school and he told my parents. They sat me down to ask me if it was true and I said no because I got embarrassed. My dad said “I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if you ever did that.” Then we all just went to bed. Never spoke about it again even though I live a very obviously depressed life… tendency to isolate, no motivation to complete daily tasks and never cared about school or hobbies other than one thing I would be obsessed with in the moment because it was my only source of joy, was vocal about how I liked sad books and my dad said “why? So you don’t feel as bad about your life?” I said yes and we laughed. He meant it as a joke because that’s our relationship, but it hurts that they never realized humor was a coping mechanism of mine even after hearing rumors I had suicidal ideation). 

I don’t mean to make my parents sound careless because they do so much for me and always support me. And I know if they knew what was going on they would feel awful, but I honestly just don’t want them to because 1. it’s awkward and 2. they’d just make it about themselves and try to fix it for me instead of just letting me do the work to get better. And I’m lucky to have that, but it’s not what I need. They’re not flawless by any means but I feel guilty complaining about them because I know they could’ve been so much worse and that they genuinely try their best but just weren’t raised to be emotionally mature. Both had pretty intense upbringings. 

Anyways, I’m 22 now and still struggle with depression (I also have ADHD so I know there are factors from that that contribute to feeling this way). I feel like I seem like someone that’s happy and has it figured out. I have a good job (even though my depression has enabled horrible spending habits so I don’t really live inside my means at the moment, but that’s something I’m actively working on), I have my own apartment, a dog, and a family that I know loves me unconditionally. So to people in my life I seem to have it together. But I don’t come across this way because I’ve actually become happier. If anything I am a much more cynical, sad person now … I’ve just been masking for so long that I don’t know how to be real anymore and I have a hard time even telling what’s real or fake within myself. I feel super uncomfortable talking to my parents about mental health and I have a therapist now that I am working with, but I just have no other support system because I don’t have many friends where I live and the friends I do have from my hometown and college… I honestly just don’t like that much so I don’t want to get closer to them because they only really get along with my masked version… and I hate that version of me so it’s hard to like people that it attracts. 

I guess I’m just in need of some support. How can I move on with my life and become a real human? Tired of walking around with this mask but don’t have people I feel comfortable taking it off in front of… and quite frankly I don’t even know who I am without it. It’s led me to intense hyper independence and I just am incapable of trusting anyone to confide in … and even if I could I don’t know how I would talk to them because I don’t even understand my feelings myself. 

How do I take off this mask and keep it off even in the presence of others? Without trauma dumping everything I’ve bottled up for the past 10 years? I have my therapist but can only afford to see her once a week right now as I try to make up for my over spending for the last 8 months. And even then when I meet with her I try to focus on the stuff I can do to improve my life and feel better rather than dwelling on the pain of my past. I know it’s a of process and I need to be patient and do the work but I just feel defeated right now after spending 3 weeks being masked while at home with my parents for the holidays."

I left a top-ranked university in my junior year because of mismanaging my finances and a lack of encouragement from my mother. She would repeatedly call me and tell me to come back home. 

I have never filed taxes before, and I’m thousands of dollars in debt. I could blame my parents for setting poor examples for me in life, but it’s really my fault. I repeatedly made poor decisions. 

I think my downward spiral started when I lost my faith after a fellow student mocked me for being a Christian. I went on to read every major atheist text at the time. I became a nihilist and convinced myself the decisions now wouldn’t matter in the future, because we all end up dead anyway. 

When I went home after college, I got caught up in working sales job and falling for the wrong guy. My brother would ask me to help him enroll in college, but I would procrastinate. Then, I’m not sure if out of boredom or peer pressure, he tried a drug with a cousin. My brother had a mental break, and subsequently spent years in and out of jail and mental institutions. He lives at home with my mother and spends most of his days sleeping on the couch due to medication. Because of his background, no one will hire him. I fucking hate myself for failing him. 

Now, I’m going on 32, and I’m a failure. I feel like a ball of wasted potential, and I don’t know how to recover. I never imagined a future without a college degree. I never imagined being a poor role model for my nieces and nephews. I became a statistic, and I have no one to blame but myself. If I weren’t so afraid to die (ironic, I know), I would have ended my miserable existence a while ago."

I know I have to work really hard to get out of this place, mentally and physically, and I can't. I just don't have that energy in me anymore. I lost it somewhere down the line.

I wanna work hard but I am unable. It's like I'm crippled, but in a different sense. How do I even explain it to people around me? It's not possible. All I'll get is even more scornful and condescending looks.

I'm 23 now, fully conscious of how my life is draining down the sewer. And even this ginormous realisation isn't enough to get me off my ass and do something about it. What can I possible do? How can I expect any help if I cannot help even myself?

Instead I'll resort to distractions. Games, in my case. They're pretty good at killing time. A few days ago I got rid of them as well.

The result? Nothing. I've sunk further into depression and loneliness. All those thoughts that those games had kept away are back.

I try new things again and again, make new plans. And nothing comes to fruition because I'm a bum who gives up. I hate this about myself. Self loathing is getting worse by the day.

That's it. I just don't know what to do, especially now that I'm aware that I'm the problem myself. Yes, life could've dealt me better cards in the beginning so that I'd never had the problems I have now and never turned into the person I am, but that ship has sailed. Now I need to take control of things and work hard at fixing things but I don't have that in me.

Sorry if this was too long. If you've read it all, thanks. I expect nothing, no sympathy or anything. I just wanted to get this off my chest, maybe hoping some of y'all might relate or understand, cause nobody around here seems to.

I’m 26 and have been constantly depressed about working a 9-5 job/40 hour work week for the past few years. I’ve been working full time, and job hopping since I was 15.

Every single day I wake up knowing that I will give away 8 hours of my life for just enough money to survive at the end of every 2 weeks. Even on my days off I’m constantly thinking about how my day needs to be so structured so that I can get my 7-8 hours of sleep, while doing all of my errands in a timely manner, so I’m basically rushing through my days off.

Let me clarify, I don’t mind my job itself. I bake cookies and it’s so easy a monkey could do it. What I’m constantly stressing over is the fact that I HAVE to give most of my day up to survive, for probably the rest of my life.

So my question is, will anti depressants help me be desensitized to this feeling? I want to go into work everyday 10 minutes early, and be happy and talkative like my coworkers, and to make management happy by being a good worker and getting sales to where they want. I hate doing all of these things, but I’d rather feel like a mindless robot than be depressed like this.

Thanks a bunch"

I'm 18 and have been recovering from depression for a while now and so far so good, but the last few weeks have been tough. I'm fed up of being single. It's not a central fixation to me like it once was but it is a little frustrating. It's so emotionally draining using dating apps and constantly getting nowhere, and its even more vexxing when people tell me i'm good looking so that surely can't be the issue. Anyway, since september I've been in a group chat with some people from my old school who I don't really consider proper friends but more the kind just to laugh with online. We often joke around at each other. They're quite immature in all honesty, but I guess I was kind of flattered initally to be in a group with people I considerd to be ""Popular"", whatever *that* even means. We were rating ourselves and others out of 10 and like someone would rate me 2/10 or whatever, I rated this guy 1.5/10. Like that he flipped, literally not even joking, says  im the ""laughing stock"" fo the group, makes fun of my appearance, what I wear, I call him a cunt and he says if hes a cunt im the nearest i've ever got to one. Even makes fun of stuff that literally isn't even in my control, like saying i ""didnt even last a month in university"" (i literally got so ill with pneumonia i had to be admitted to the emergency department). Makes fun of the fact my only job right now is delivering pizza (its a part time job ffs) . i just say this, and I advise you to ask anyone else this who is giving you grief:

""What have you genuinely ever done in your life that you are proud of?""

He couldn't answer.

I've battled depression every day for god knows how many years in all honesty. anxiety before that. I have done battle, every single day for the last five or so years, be it with bullies on the playground or demons in my head. I stood on the edge of life and death, and chose life, even though it got far worse before it got better. I stand up for people, the other day (again it has been a bad few weeks) I literally put my own safety and to be honest probably my life in danger by standing up to someone who was raically abusing someone in the street, and got threatened myself. I have self respect now. I don't take shit from no one. If it wasnt for the fact I'm applying for a job where it won't exaclty look good if I assault people, I probably wouldn't mind knocking him about a bit. Not that I need to. He's already lost a friend over it, some guy in the group told me how outrageous he was and how he wont be friends with im anymore. 

It did hurt, a lot to be honset, because I'm already sensitive about the things he touched on at a time where I'm strugglign to understand why I'm still single. The stuff he said might have driven myself a few months ago to suicide. Or someone else.  People like him...*theyre* the ones who don't deserve to be alive, not us. I know the type. I've dealt with them many times before. They all give it large and when someone gives it back to them at their expense they throw a tantrum. He literlaly tried to gaslight me into thinking that it was me who couldn't take it, but I'm sorry he knew a bit about my background and anyone with any kind of decency wouldn't say that especially to someone in my position. I hate people like that. They seem to have everything in life given to them. He tells me hes more of a man than me because hes slept with more women. Well sorry what a pathetic judgement of character. I'm teh one who'se literally battled a mental illness every day for years, and stands up for whats right and wrong.

My fuck ups. My mistakes. My lifelong emotional trauma. My negative core beliefs.

I slowly walked upstairs to my shower. *it’s odd that showering is a chore, isn’t it?* I turned the water as hot as it could go, because I wanted to feel pain. I wanted to punish myself for being so unlovable, for being so wrong about everything all the time, and for even existing. I wanted to feel pain, but I’m too damn weak to even do it a more dangerous way. I’m so damn weak that it was added to the list of what I’m punishing myself for. 

I sat down in the shower. My legs folded under me like a piece of paper, while I just let the water burn my skin. It hurt so badly, but it’s what I deserved: pain. I bawled my eyes out until my eyes physically hurt and I could barely see. Why am I like this? What did I do to deserve to feel this way? Why am I so incapable of love?

The shower filled up with water after sitting there for 40 minutes. At that point, I began to wonder if it were the water from the shower, or my painful, soul-piercing tears."

We made our own food, ate outside during summer, and played games. There where also good areas to play and explore as a kid. The best was always an outdoor hottub that was just pure joy. 

For me it fell apart when one evening my hormones took me over and i harassed my cousin unter the water. touched her when she was 10. At the time i just tought wow this feels good. And now im just ashamed and cant even recognize myself. Touching someone that didnt understood what was going on? how i said i just feel shame. Today she is a boy. Im just so confused and guilty that it could be my fault for destroying her life.

After that i grew distance with my family, visited less until today i dont even see or talk on the phone with them. It feels like a mindgame that just torments me from the inside.

Sort of felt a having a mini DBT session sometimes. Surely someone like that would give an explanation, I was always reasonable in expectations. Not really though, I guess when you’re out of someone’s life they instantly don’t give a flying fuck about you.

 Hi,

  
Writing yesterday felt good. Typing the words hurt, but there was also some sort of release there.. So I should carry it on (or at least I think?).

  
I woke up this morning with a headache that can be compared to being hit with a brick. I always get this same headache after I've had a really shit day and the stranger takes over. Its like the stranger just leaves a little reminder that she's still within me but not in full control on this day. Basically, I've taken a hit and lost some HP points due to her presence and control from yesterday. Today I feel good. Well, better. I look like shit, these hits sure do take a toll on my physical being but I have eaten and drank something other than coffee and this is a win. A win is a win, I will take what I can get.

  
Having a stranger living with you is one of the most powerless feelings you could probably feel or least it is to me. Having a constant switch between the person you know as yourself to a stranger you despise and can't be around is exhausting. ''What could the trigger be today? '' ''Why would that be a trigger? '' ''Do I even have triggers or is this just me now? '' These questions fly around my dark clouded mind everyday almost all day.I'm walking on egg shells because of myself. I need to protect myself from the stranger lurking in my mind and feeding off of my guilt, traumas, shame and hurt. I've never been a big Harry Potter fan, but it feels like those Dementors just sucking the fucking life out of you, but I am just a simple Muggle with a twig in my hand to fight it off. It's a battle that I am not yet fully equipped to fight, but I'm right in the middle of it calling for back up and I can see the troops on the horizon approaching at a snails pace. And here's that small piece of hope I said that I hated so much on 29.12.2021; They are still approaching. This is hope.  
Having hope when you feel so confused, spilt and hurt within yourself, is a hard thing to have. Dangerous. It keeps you going but you still keep getting let down. I, give me hope and then I also disappoint myself. It's a circle that I cannot break yet. Over time the feeling of hope has faded, but on certain days it is stronger than it has ever been.. What the actual fuck am I supposed to do with the emotions that are constantly contradicting and fighting against each other? One same emotion can bring me so much joy one day and destroy me the next. Come on, give me a break. I don't want to also feel fear and uncertainty when I am suppose to feel a comforting (and happy) feeling due to ''hope''.Is my brain programming itself for that emotion? Can I unlearn, and relearn and ''false'' way to feel an emotion? To be honest, my brain feels like a minefield and I wouldn't be surprised if there was some scientific evidence that we can do that to ourselves. For me, I want to know and understand why and where this comes from. What the root is. The only logical thing I can think is that my brain is doing this to protect me.   
Or maybe its the stranger. She's stealing it from me. She wants all that could make me feel good and human. Maybe my hope is too strong and scares her and therefore this is her point of attack. Fucking smart move stranger.   
I don't want to think too deep in the way that the stranger is taking it from as I feel that's welcoming her with open arms to do the damage I am scared she would do. Apparently I'm a good host. Maybe I should become a bitch to her and take my hope and slam the door in her face. That'll show her. Until the next time she takes over at least.. Because I know that there will be a next time. At this moment, I need to keep that in mind, to be safe and not shocked when she does take over. She will get weaker, those troops are on the hill. If they could just pick up the pace in time.  
Until maybe next time, please keep going, I don't want to lose you completely yet.  
From (what feel like) the real you  "

I used to talk to this guy every single day and I considered him one of my favorites, we used to play games together and thanks to him I know a lot of songs that I'm interested, but lately he has been a ghost on the gaming app and I've noticed back then he always would add people and unfriend them after awhile, he unfriended everyone but ME, whenever I got online he would wait for me to play and constantly even bug me, but I loved that because to me it meant he was loyal and bugging me constantly meant he liked my company 

He stopped playing on the gaming app but we had each others Instagram, he kept me there for months but today for the first time I did kind of a face reveal since I never had posts or stories, I'm travelling so I took a video of me next to a theme park at night, me and my aunt having fun. 

He saw the first story which i wasn't there , he only saw the airplane photo shoot, he didn't unfollow yet but he didn't look at my second story that had my picture on, few hours later he saw my second story and unfollowed me.

I understand that if I tried to flirt with him without being his type or just being ugly would keep him away ,but really, we were just pretty good friends so I ask myself why.. Was it only my personality, was it the mystery, is it the fact that I'm a person of color? I wonder why he did that"

I just started medication for depression for the first time. I’ve been trying to cope with stress, anxiety and depression through therapy and meditation and avoid medication but I burned out just now and doctor recommended meds.

I’ve been on them for 8 days now. I still feel bad. Now I know that they take more than week to have effect and I know they are not a fast way to happiness but still I’m getting anxious about medication and am afraid they will only make me worse.

My burnout symptoms where pretty much heart palpitations, heartburn, anxiety and finally insomnia that broke me to seek help. 

Since then - a bit over week ago - my symptoms are still the same if not even worse. 

And I am getting doubts if my medication is just making me feel worse. 

Should I just give them a chance now? Just wait for some days to see if they start to effect? Can it also be that if I have some effects from starting them that they will go away once I get used to meds? 

I just need some comfort to my thoughts and energy to keep going. I feel like my body is just on overdrive all the time."

I have seen my fair share of therapists and really only had 2 or 3 who were a good match, not all are. I really think a good therapist is somebody who doesn't just listen to you talk and gladly take your money. They're not somebody who lets you say whatever you want and either just believes all of it, doesn't interupt you or call you on it, or somebody who doesn't challenge you to actually get better by trying new things going outside your comfort zone or just realizing stuff about you. I'd say anyone who I've known who needs therapy who has gone and done idk like 5 sessions always thinks they're fixed and there was nothing wrong with them, but the issue was the therapist didn't do their job or care, because they should be there to identify the real problem- either you're hiding it, its touchy or you don't want to talk about it, or you didn't even know it was there and its never been addressed. This almost never happens except with truly exceptional rare hard to find therapists. This world is full of a lot of froofy political correctness and blowing butterflies and rainbows up peoples asses to make them feel good and nice and comfortable, but that doesn't spark change and every person who breaths needs to change, nobody is above this and everyone could use a little work on themselves. Therapy isn't supposed to be comfortable, safe yes, comfortable no, and there is a very big difference. The sad part is that so many people misunderstand the reason that people need therapy or the point of going, and the therapists think that helping looks like handholding and listening only and have no skills further on what to do. Far too many unqualified (in skills not education), undriven people and those who are mentally unstable people themselves decide to pursue a career in therapy, much like those in nursing- because they ""want to help people"" and they don't have any other skills or clue what to do. 
I like to say that for people graduating high school: men go into the armed forces or physical labor jobs, and women decide to be either a hair dresser, a nurse, or a therapist.

I have since I was 15 years old felt that I don't have any purpose in life. I don't hate my life, but most of the time I feel that it's just empty and I don't enjoy it. I'm always anxious and most of the time I think of things that make me feel bad like how my life will look in the future or different ways I can die of.

My family is the best and my parents are amazing and I think that they would understand and listen if I'd speak to them about this, but I don't have the guts to do it and I think they would probably forget about it after a while. I think one of my issues is that my family expects me to live up to a certain standard but I can't. It's not a high bar and most people are probably able to do it, but I'm very lazy and I'm horrible at taking initiative. My father is very kind, but he is very passively aggressive towards me and keeps making jokes and dropping comments when he can about me because he is disturbed by fact that I'm not very good at anything. I have a lot of friends but I don't feel like talking about this to any of them either.

My anxiety peaks when I need to make a hard decision that I don't wanna do or when I bury myself too deep into my thoughts or when I get comments from my family that make me think that I'm bad as a person. Personally, I think I should be able to deliver more of what they expect of me, but often I feel like that I just can't. 

Sometimes I can wake up and I just spend the whole day staring at the wall, just feeling empty inside and not leaving the bed even once. Have anyone been in a similar spot in life and can relate and maybe knows how to get out of this?

If so is there anything that keeps you grounded when you’re going through all of these problems at once.

Okay so I’ll try to start from the beginning to put things into context. I come from a South Asian home. Long story, short SA daughters are expected to be miss perfect, home trained and not date or have boyfriends but when we are 25 we should randomly find a husband. SA women tend to be very sheltered, naive, people pleasers, submissive, rely on others etc we don’t get to have life experiences like travel etc but our parents tend to be strict and say things like “travel with your husband” and our curfew is 10pm ish so we don’t get to experience nightlife etc

Also our families tend to be very broken. I don’t come from a good home. My dads side is very toxic: always arguing about money and stupid shit. My grandma is insufferable and a terrible MIL to my mom and I feel sorry for my mom that she has to marry into such a terrible unloving family. So did I. I don’t have any sisters or close cousins my age to interact with. I have one older bro (33 now) and he obviously didn’t get as many restrictions like me. He treated our house like a hotel. Coming home at 3am. I came home at 2am once when I was 21 and got a whole lecture and my brother gets nothing. He’s a doctor and married now so he is successful and set in life. While I’m over here rotting away like a loser and Covid only made things worse..

I’ve never had a bf and I’m still a virgin. Not for religious reasons but Bc I’ve never connected with anyone like that. Even when I do put myself out there I attract low quality annoying men who talk too much (no offense but some men need to shut up) or emotionally unavailable men who just want to hook up. Which isn’t me. Good men do exist, but they get taken quickly but good women. I don’t have what it takes to attract a good men Bc they wouldn’t go for a depressed 30 year old like me. I don’t blame them either. I had a small window and I let it pass.

I don’t make much ($45k take home pay) and I live with my parents. (I was gonna move on but Covid fucked everything up) I hate my college degree (accounting) and I don’t see myself getting a MBA, quite frankly I hate studying and I know I’m too depressed to focus. I hate working too so why bother with more school. The only other option I have is to start a business, which is fucking hard when I’m not passionate about anything to even be motivated/have disciple. I don’t have any ambitions or life long goals. I’m just here surviving poorly.

I have no friends either, I think that is obvious. And yes I’ve tried hobbies and meetups etc.. I’m not ugly but underweight (5’5, 113 lbs) I’ve been working out for over a year and haven’t had that much gains Bc I don’t eat enough Bc I’m depressed. I’m stuck in this negative feed back loop.

I have so much baggage now it is terrible. I wish I died young so I wouldn’t have to deal with it. I hate myself, my mind and my life. I wish I could end my life just so I wouldn’t have to think anymore. I wish I died of Covid. I don’t see myself being alive in another 5 years. If I could die this moment, I would. I bought rope from amazon but haven’t used it yet..

I fucking miss the early 2010s and being a kid so bad. I’d do anything to go back. The music, I had a decent social circle. But through the years I’ve lost contact with everyone. I didn’t dorm so I missed out on college life and I resent my parents for that. Because I could’ve had more opportunities to make life long friends. Most ppl are just friends with their co workers or old classmates.

I’m full of so much hate that the people I do hate, I would watch their kids die and do nothing to help. If the purge were legal tomorrow, I’d kill them in a heartbeat. Yea I’ve gone to therapy and taken meds too..

I just hate being alive and everything that comes with it. Paying bills, eating and sleeping regularly, showering daily, etc. I hate meeting ppl now Bc I know they will disappoint me somehow. So now I just lock myself in my room, get high off thc gummies and listen to music. That’s the only thing I somewhat look forward to. As pathetic as it sounds. 

Please don’t come here trying to give my advice. I’ve done it all: hobbies, books, therapy, meds, exercise, diet, meditation. Please I’m sick of it, I’m not a mentally healthy person and my life is pointless… I’m a failure and a loser and I’m starting to accept that. It is 4:17 am and I’m writing this realizing how much I hate myself and how nothing means anything… I’d be better off dead. Women don’t have a large prime to begin with. A lot more is expected from women and we have to get “our shit together” earlier than men Bc patriarchy of course.

 I haven’t been outside the country since I was 17 for a family wedding.. I have no friends to travel with and no I don’t want to travel solo or with a woman’s group with some strangers. I wasted my 20s and it is all my fault. Sure my family was strict but it’s my fault now. I just wish I was dead. 

Idk if anyone will read or respond to this. I have no one to talk to anyway so it doesn’t matter… so might as well bare my soul on the internet, on a male dominated space anyway…"

rrw54o,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rrw54o/a_fever_nightmare/,A fever nightmare.,3,1,1640850683.0,"My partner packed their things when I was at work two weeks ago, and left a note saying they were going to live with their parents in Connecticut, because they couldn’t handle the financial burden. We’d been staying together, along with another couple, for about four months. They have bpd and I thought we had created a healthy space for us to communicate and understand each other. 

I found out last night that that was a lie. 
When I met them they were living with their ex/roommate, solely providing for the house off of their income from their time in the military, and the job that they were working. Their ex was planning on going rehab because she had an addiction to heroine and almost died. After she got out, my roommate, and their partner, my partner and her and someone she met in rehab, 6 of us, went to an NA meeting together, where she told me she was glad I was able to be there for them, my partner, in their time of need. 

Fast forward a couple of months and they call me because they cut themselves because she claimed they cheated on her while she was in rehab with me. (We were poly,sorta, at the time. All they were okay with what I did with other people and they chose not to cuz that was their choice) 

I told them, that she was manipulating them and she was trying to hurt them. Fast forward another couple months, April ish of 2021 we start being monogamous. Their wishes, I was okay with that. I didn’t have interest in other people besides them anyway. Around July they quit their job, because of stress, and he spends more time at his own apartment getting to make ends meet, somehow. Door dashing and shit. I don’t know. 

She has a neurological issue, not sure what but I know she is doing because of it slowly. Apparently something similar to what robin williams had. So she is seeking some help with that, per what I’m told. 

I told my partner that she needs to be with her family so they can help to take care of her because she is not their responsibility. And she is dragging their mental and financial health down. I suggest they come stay with me. 

They finally agrees and in late July I think, they move in. It’s rocky, but we make it work. All they have to do is pay their portion of rent and part of the internet. A little for groceries. They’re making almost $1,000 from their disability as was. (Guestimation, I never knew, we never discussed that far yet.) 

I hadn’t noticed at the time, but after last night my roommate and I started putting together the pieces. 

They started going to therapy, because they have complex ptsd non war related, pertaining to cars and dogs. 
They were doing really good. Until it got too much and they stopped. I didn’t push it too far, with encouragement to continue I mean. 

Shortly after they stop going to therapy, they had visited their parents in Connecticut. They got drunk alot and messaged me telling me they loved me and wanted to marry me If they weren’t such a hard head. Real sweet things. 

They never liked living in the town we live in. They felt alien. Out casted. Like no one they spoke to meshed well with them. 

When they got back, I knew they were unhappy. There wasn’t much I could do except be as supportive and do everything I could to help. We were planning on moving apartments and stuff so we would be closer to the city so they could walk around and not feel the stress of cars, I was working on getting them a service dog, breed specific because I know they would need that because of the type of trauma it was. 

Sometime in October they got a call from said ex roommate, who I was under the assumption hated them and didn’t want to speak to them because she still claimed they cheated on her with me. She texted him something along the lines of, “thank you and goodbye” or something similar. They knew immediately that she was attempting to UnAlive herself, can’t blame her because of her illness, it leads to that. So much pain they end up UnAliving themselves. They called the cops, the cops got there in time, they took her to the hospital. 

My partner was very stressed. 
Now before I met him, she had basically played savior and rescued him from an abusive relationship with his ex fiancé, or wife, I don’t know, according to new information. So they’re relationship developed based on that. Trauma bonding. 

Anyway. My partner had always said they felt bad because she was their only friend here outside of me. And leaving her the way they did, never really sat well I assume. 

Anyway so two ish weeks I wanna say goes by and they finally get a message from her. “Fuck you for calling the cops, but thanks for saving my life” and that was the end of it, or so I thought atleast. 

After that point is when I can remember them having financial struggle despite not having a lot of responsibility at our home. And hindsight is definitely 20/20. 

We we looking forward to going to a concert in nashville for one of his favorite local bands. Well. We’d planned it out for some time. Scheduling and such cuz my work is consistent. 

We head to nashville for the show and there is nothing. We’re very confused. Apparently they had cancelled because of covid and we didn’t get the notice till we were right there. 

To say they we upset was to downplay it. That show was holding them down, a goal to be reached. And it had been rescheduled to January. I can see the change in them on the ride home, but I don’t know how to help outside of what information they had given me to help them with. We’d built a communication basis. 

Sometime after that is when they started hanging out with “their friend from their old job” it only happened twice. The first time. They came home at like 2 am after falling asleep there after getting high on weed. (Which was fine. Weed was fine but other drugs were talked about.)


*** This is being continued after I spent 10 days in a psychiatric hospital because I came really close to driving my car into the river. I’m glad I went. I’m doing much better. ***

The next time they didn’t come home. Nov 29th, I came home and their stuff was gone and I had a note. The note and the stuff they left is out of my reach at the moment, been put in a safe place till I’m in a better mindset to deal with it. The note said something along the lines of -
“I couldn’t live in a panicked state any longer. I had to leave, I want you to know none of this is your fault. I’ve blocked you on social media and I’ll talk to you in a few days. I’ll miss you”

Two weeks passed and in that time I planned to move to Connecticut, looked at 1 bedrooms for myself. Bus routes. My jobs position and if it was available for me there. 

On Dec 16th I messaged his ex/roommate and bellow is how the conversation went. 

“Hey I didn't want to reach out cuz I
didn't want to both you but have
you heard from Jared in the last two
weeks? He went to back to
Connecticut and he hasn't spoken
to me and I'm low key losing my
mind. Okay. Low key is a lie. High
key. I'm high key losing my shit.”-Me

“Sounds kinda like what he did to
me, haha. I mean I'm sorry, but
yeah he's alive and safe and all.”-Her

“Forget I asked. Thank you for
letting me know.”-me

“I mean you really didn't think you
would come into my relationship
knowingly, you both force me
through this polyamory bullshit, you
pretend boyfriend and girlfriend for
a couple months, then when he
breaks your heart, come and ask
me. He wrote you a note, you know
he's okav.”-her

“A) y'all were broken up. B) I didn't
force vou to do anything. C) I didn't pretend anything with him. I was
honest, loving, caring, and kind,
through in and through out. D) I
was atleast hoping for some
compassion from you. That's it. Thank you for letting me know “ -Me 

“No we werent broken up lol ever.
He must have lied about that one.
And we'll force in a sense of. If I
didn't want to lose Jared, I had to
play the game. And I'm sure you
were, honestly, I know you were.
You can say we were broken up or
whatever. But you knew he lived
with me. You knew we were still
messing around and stuff, or did
you not? I would have been
compassionate, but I can't help but
not like it when anybody the guy or
the other girl think it's okay to just
step into someone relationship and
take shit over. He wasn't
polyamorous, he was manic, do to
his borderline. The entire way he
looked was different than it was
when y'all met. First manic episode
in a long long time.”-Her

“What happened between y'all is not
my responsibility. I have full faith and trust in what he told me and I
believe him. I know he wasn't poly. I
didn't ask him to be. I only asked if
he was okay with me doing me until
I figured myself out. Hell, I wasn't
even sure I was but I was just
following my flow of life and trying
to find what worked best for me. I
don't think I stepped into anything
except what he told me. What
happened between him and I, is our
business.”-me

“yeah he was kind of lying to you,
about a lot of things. I'm sorry. Your
relationship was kind of bullshit, I
don't mean that in a bad way, I
mean literally founded on bullshit.
Me and him were still together
completely until he moved in with
you. And no that's not you're fault.
I'm sorry if you didn't know. But
Jared was sick as fuck when all that
was happening. I'm not vouching
for him, cause he knows how
fucked it was to use anybody. Me or
you. And he used us both. But
that's not typical Jared. Either way.
Sorry if I was being a bitch. The
way I understood it was that you
knew we were still together and you and him decided to fuck around
anyways and then you let him run
off to you when I was sick as fuck.
Either way all that shits over with
now. And I'm sorry that you got hurt
in the process of me and Jared
figuring shit out.
And I actually kicked him out
He didn't choose to come move in
with you.” -her 

“Listen I appreciate you responding,
and I mean no disrespect in this but
honestly I hold no value to the
information you've given me. As I
said, what you and he did is none of
my business or my concern,
because up until a certain point he
and I spoke about, I was also still
seeing people, with his knowledge.
I don't think he used me, even in
the slightest. I very much enjoyed
every single moment he and I spent
together, and if I'm being
completely honest. I'm willing to
move to Connecticut to make this
work with him. I know he has his
flaws, I have my own. But I love him.
I'm not mad he left the way he did,
shit I saw it comina. Im hurt and confused, but not mad.” -me

“What are you not getting? Jared is
with me right now? We are
together. He begged me to come
with him. I'm not saying this shit to
hurt you but just let it go dude.
Cause now you will be stepping into
my relationship. And I'm not dealing
with that.”-her 

**At this point I lost my absolute shit. Started seriously panicking. I knew where the apartment was where they’d been and recklessly I got in my car and headed there to see it with my own two eyes.**

“You're not gonna see him face to
face
There's his voice” -her (with an attached audio with him saying “leave it alone, I’m never going to talk to her again just drop it”)

From this point I asked if she was in our state and she lied and said no they were already in CT. 

“He feels terrible, he really does. But
it's just gotta be a clean cut. That
was his choice and I don't really
agree with it either.
He won't talk to you, I'm sorry. This
is better than not knowing at all
though
I can't answer, I'm not gonna get
anyone else riled up.” -her 

More begging to talk to him and calling with no pick up. 

“The answer is he was sick when he
met you, he lied to you about a lot.
He got better in therapy and then
immediately came back to me. And I told him we couldn't do that to
you, so he left. But I'm sorry
He's not the guy you were in love
with
He feels terrible about it
I understand. He left me once to.
Ghosted me entirely
He will never tell you. He's already
told me, he wanted to cut it clean
so he left a note
I'm sorry but unless one day he
chooses to, you're not gonna hear
from him again
I'm gonna have to block your
number if you don't stop calling, I'm really sorry, but I went through this
exact same shit, but our
relationship was founded on the
truth.
I didn't think he'd come back and I
let him go. “ her. 


I sent an Afro message, crying, hoping he would hear it. Saying that going to her was like going back to his abusive ex. Which she returned an audio message of her and him discussing what I assume was her telling him what i said instead of him hearing it directly. 


“You said I'm like Joe? Lolol I never
did a goddamn thing to Jared
besides help him out and love him.
But since you said that I'm gonna
have to block you.” Her

At this point I arrived and mistakenly “cop knocked” on their door. The rest of the text messages are me begging to talk to him and her telling me he was avoiding me and that she “WaS sOrRy” that I got hurt. 

I left and gave up cuz I’m reality he wasn’t gunna talk to me. I drove directly to my mothers and walked into her room and told my siblings to go upstairs. Once they were out I closed the door. Told my mom what was going on and then preceded to curl into the fetal position and let out a guttural  scream at the top of my lungs with all my emotions for about 10 minutes. I screamed myself hoarse. It broke me. My best friend got of work and drove to my moms and we all talked about it. Apparently there were things I didn’t see and didn’t know. But she didn’t feel like it was something that was a big deal, but hindsight is 20/20. I left my car at my moms and went home with her. I slept on the couch that night. The next day I was dazed and went with my best friend to run some errands so I wasn’t alone. In the evening I had to get my car and take it home, which meant I would be alone, because she had to run some solo errands and I wanted to go home…. On the way home I saw the signs, the intrusive thoughts I couldn’t fight anymore. The longing. The desire to not exist anymore. And I took those signs, and called my mom. I told her I was going to wait for my best friend to get home and that I would be going to the hospital in nashville.she stayed on the phone until I got home. It was pretty late so when my best friend got home we went to the hospital and had to go through the Er. Ten days later, a lot of tears, self regulation and inner work, I finally feel safe and I’m home. Medicated and with alot more coping mechanism. And a plan. 

I have no regrets. I don’t regret the love I gave. I don’t regret the decisions I made. I don’t regret going to the hospital. If I could tell him one thing, it would be to live for himself and no one else. I hope he goes to his family, because they will see she is a terrible influence on him and very toxic. I hope he builds the life he wants and writes the book he was working on. I hope he continues to love his hobbies and his music. I hope he finds peace in himself. 


I’m sorry if this is confusing. I’m glad I got help. Thank you Reddit."

I was scrolling through Reddit and I saw a thread about people were talking about sleepovers they had when they were kids and with each reply, my heart sank a bit more. It's like I have missed out on my childhood and I am not any better now.

The only thing good for me right now is a high GPA that's it. I don't have any friends I hate the way I look, the way I speak, the fact that I have glasses, I have acne all over my face, sometimes I just want to burn my face or slash it so that I have an excuse to be so goddam fucking ugly.

Honestly, the only thing that's keeping me going is the fact I have my suicide planned out in exactly 9 years I am to kill myself and I am not doing it now because I am a coward. I just wish  I get enough courage to do it like in a week. 

The funny thing is I am doing absolutely nothing to improve my situation like I just pity myself and the cycle continues, I hope that one day I hate myself so much it will be enough to kill myself.

I dont know why but I've always had this plaque on my brain thats made my life difficult. Every day is a struggle and constant battle. I have been told that my depression and anxiety is most likely genetic and I live in pain. From the beginning I had no chance at being happy or ""normal"". I was destined to be physically and mentally exhausted. I was destined to be a burden to everyone in my life. 

My family (parents mostly) try to do everything in their power to give me a great life. They got me help when I needed it and try to understand as much as they can. Only so much can go a long way. They will never truly understand how it feels to live with what I have. No matter how many times I explain it to them I know that deep down they think my depression is a ""deep sadness"" caused by outside factors. I know it's hard to understand things you don't personally go through but it sucks to know that no matter what you say or do, you'll constantly be misunderstood 

I dont really have friends. I just have acquaintances. I used to have ""friends"" but they were mostly held together by circumstances i no longer have. I dont go out, I only go to work, school and back home. My life is a never ending cycle of monotony. A never ending loop of struggling to get out of bed and trying to walk the earth as a normal functioning human being. I have nothing really keeping me going. No relationships besides the familial ones I have with my parents and my job. 

It has never been this bad before but I feel it getting even worse. I dont know how much more I can handle. The mix of being born with a hindrance and no outside motivation/ stimulation turns for a bleak future on my end. I truly have nothing to live for but im just too chicken to actually jump the gun. Im just a selfish young adult"

Every time I try to talk about how I’m struggling with depression (or just anything that I’m having difficulty going through) to my friends or my SO, I feel as if it gets brushed off. There were few times I mentioned how I am struggling with my depression to my SO, and I don’t know if they just forget or they’re really just that uninterested in me, but all they would say is, “I’m surprised you have depression. You’re so cheerful all the time.” and does not give me any words of comfort. Similar thing with my friends, where I’d tell them how I’m not doing too well and I would try and open up but it always just goes back to how they’re having a harder time.

Cuz' thats what i feel like ive been doing latley.

I cant be alone or I instantley become washed with feelings of self hatred and sometimes have suicidal thoughts

As a result, I've put all of my thoughts and energy from running from this feeling

I'm always hangingout with friends, cuz when I'm with them, I'm filled with this energy

And I don't feel empty anymore

I become self-destructive

I smoke weed, I get shitfaced, I steal, light shit on fire, I go to parties

I hate myself. I cant help being bad. I just am.

When I'm alone...

I hit my nic until I'm sick

I call/dm my friends until someone answers

Eat some edibles and then put on some music

Idk if it's exactly self harm, but I take my pens and pencils and push them against my thumb until it bleeds

When I fall asleep I have nightmares

I have not past trama, but they're usually about losing everyone I love and being left alone

I can't be alone

It has recently come to a head where my therapist wants me to take a medical leave from work and enter an in Patient mental health program. 

I have been talking to my husband about it and he thinks that my therapist and I are being over dramatic. He is concerned that we cannot financially support me taking a leave of absence from work and thinks that I just need to try harder. 

My husband is a perfectionist, a former marine, and a police officer. He likes the house to be clean and orderly and he gets frustrated when it isn’t. I recently have been struggling so bad that I am choosing between showering and doing the dishes (I always choose the dishes to make my husband happy) which means that today was the first time I showered since before Christmas. 

I told my husband that I could potentially avoid taking a medical leave if I could do the therapy in the evenings after work meaning I wouldn’t really help with the house or the kids. I told him the number 1 thing I needed from him was to not let his frustration show with the process. Instead, I needed him to be supportive, happy, and jovial otherwise I would feel like a burden and the whole process wouldn’t work. He said “how am I supposed to act like you aren’t a burden when you are refusing to do anything to stop being a burden”. 

This confirmed to me that I am making his life worse and not better. I am not and have never been actively suicidal and I wouldn’t want to do anything to take me away from my daughters. But I want to stop burdening my husband with my bullshit and I can’t figure out how. It feels completely hopeless at this point. I know that one day soon my husband will wake up and realize he doesn’t have to deal with this shit and just leave me. Part of me even wishes he would just to save himself. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for with this post. I just needed to get it all off my chest. I want to be better. I want to feel good. I just wish I knew how."

(mom was cheating and i caught her). it eventually lead to their seperation and i kept blaming myself because it can still be fixed. since then, i've developed anxiety and have told no one. i kept crying on random occassions, having breakdowns and isolating myself from my friends. i started harming myself through not eating nor drinking for about 2 weeks when the situations around me worsened. i couldnt do what i usually do even the most important task. when my ex broke up with me because she cheated, my trauma was brought up and finally lost my will to live. i attempted suicide through cutting. i thought that would be my last moments and i didnt felt any regret on what i did. when the bleeding stopped, i was disappointed. after that day, i just started to get back on my feet and tried to distract myself as much as possible but now i'm scared to become alone again because i know that if i had a breakdown, i would probably end my life because i now know how precise i should be. this feeling just keeps getting heavier and heavier everyday. every single fucking day i would have a breakdown on a random time. a lot of strangers have told me that i should seek therapy but i dont think that would work nor i would want to see one."

Another reason is because I'm too emotional and can't seem to handle the reallity we live in, and really feel it would be fair that I would kill myself or get killed, or aborted even at my 19 years, cause I'm too emotional and can't seem to handle my emotions, I get bitter and complain about everything, I don't seem to have any sort of self respect, and can't change my self or my mind, especially not having any kind of emotional support, not even from my parents, who shouldn't have had the idea of having kids if they weren't going to teach me much about life or listen to my problems and understand me or even take me seriously, and just tell me that's how life is and I just have to deal with it and suck life's dick, BUT HOW DO I DEAL WITH IT?

i hate myself. why do i do this. why am i so terrible. why the fuck cant i stop fucking eating. im such a stupid fat fucking pig who should shit her fucking wrists again. im so dumb, fucking giving myself to people online, making my mom pay so much just to send me off to a school in which im failing. i want to overdose again. im tired dude, im so horrible. im so ugly. im so annoying. why cant i do anything right. i wake up every day and just eat and sit on my fucking computer. im a waste of fucking space. all i do is look for validation online but it never fucking works out because they can smell the degeneracy from me. im never good enough. id say i wanna stop trying but i dont fucking try.

It was a little tight, but in a good way. I just laid in it for about an hour and it was like my brain just turned off. I'm guess the effect of the sleeping bag being tight is similar the calming effect that weighted blankets have on certain people. Maybe I need a weighted blanket."

Needless to say, I’m completely broken, I grew knowing things a teenager should’ve never know at their age, I comforted my depressed mom when my sisters dad cheated on her (this is where everything started), and this has been going on for almost 6 years, trying my best to give advice to my mother.

Thing is, she doesn’t want to be helped, she just vents, vents a lot, cries, but doesn’t want a solution and doesn’t want to do anything about it, for almost 6 years. She’s 46 years old, but she says she’s too old to meet new people, too old to have more friends or continue the already existing ones, too old to go out and have a drink, and pretty much her life is already gone from her because she is just that old.

It’s so hard trying to convince her this is not true, it hurts me a lot watching my mom break down because of loneliness, but loneliness that she herself chose. She just stays at home, goes to work, comes back home, then work again, I have never seen her going out, having fun, she is fully committed to raising my sister and I, but I know she is not happy.

Friends have invited her to go out, she refuses every single time, then complains to me she is lonely and that’s she’ll die alone.

I wish I could go inside her brain and change her thoughts.

The only thing I can do is cry myself to sleep knowing that one day I’ll leave this house to continue my life, so will my sister, and I’ll leave my mother alone.

I wish she could see how much life she has left and the things she has been missing on.

I have tried to make her go to psychologist but she doesn’t listen, and I can’t handle much more. I’m considering going to a therapist myself at this point, because I’m worn out, I’m damaged.

I just want her to be happy, it would make me so happy to see her have that life in her eyes again.

I don’t know what’s the point of this post, I guess I’m venting too. Thanks for reading."

I do however have problems with sleeping, aswell as eating and a overbearing sense that im sort of being left behinde by the river of time. It feels like when ever i try to do something it always goes wrong in some irreparable way taking me back to square one again.

This combined with a breakup and falling out with my girlfriend and atleast in the top 5 for best friends, have made the past months a bit hard on me. These bad feeling got so bad today that i could do nothing but lay in bed all day, not even on my phone for most of it, just stuck in my own head. I would however say that im still very thankful for what i do have and function just like everyone else for the most part. This leads us to present day... present time.

So, since i still live at home my mother has started to worry. She knows how bad mental issues can go, considering she had a neurosis about 10 years ago and was put in a mental hospital for a short time. 

(something my ex would make Freud jokes about, since she thought i was into insane women. Which i guess she proved right in the end)

Considering this my mother has been quite blunt about how she is worried about me, and how i need to act before things get ugly. Which i in part agree with. I think that its just a matter of feeling like im in limbo, where i cant really go do the things i want to do in life. My current ambition is simply to join the navy, something i have wanted to do for a long time. However due to some unkown problem with my heart which doctors still cant explain, the navy is out of the picture for the moment if not forever. The second option is to go to university but for that i will have to go back and up my grade in physics, which is something i would be willing to do however is kinda hard to set up due to all of the things going on in the world right now.

I have explained this her many times but each times she simply brushes it off and tells me the strangest boomer depression cures you can imagien. ""You feel sad cause you dont go to the mall and by new clothes every week"" or ""you need to joy ride in your car more"" or the one mentiond in the title ""all you got to do is go outside and wash your car once in a while to get your mind off things and youll be fine""

I feel kinda hurt by this since it feels like she is sort of saying that if i literally put the smallest amount of effort in, i would feel better. But i mostly find it funny as fuck and it really gave insight to how fucked the older generations view on mental health is.

Dont really have much more to say, its like 4 am i just needed to get this off my chest. If you made it this far, sorry i couldent give you a more satisfying ending and i hope your doing alright <3"

I have been feeling low, loss of motivation to move/exercise/eat, find hard to get out of bed etc. And have been told by doctors that I'm depressed. I am in counselling but thought the lack of sleep, lack of eating etc was stress from college but it's gotten worse since I've finished college for the Christmas.

I guess I just need advice cause the doctors want to put me on medication but I don't really want that, I just want to sleep, I'm not suicidal but for personal reasons I don't want to take medication cause of previous experiences I've had over the years with bad reactions to medication or doctors being negligent with medication which has cause me both physical and mental pain.

In middle school, I became a socially awkward individual and gained little to no social skills. My nervousness prevented me from making any solid friends and just made me envy those who could be able to. This gradually got worse till I went into high school.

In high school I watched as my peers slowly break away, creating their own friend groups, and hang out with each other. Being on Instagram slowly became a living nightmare as it only made me envy what I didn't have anymore. This is also the time where I started trying to create and maintain an actual relationship with a girl but that went absolutely no where. No matter how I tried to change myself, the most I could do is learn how to do it but in the end I was just missing something girls wanted. This caused my first relationship to not really be one, my second one to end abruptly, and my third one to be terrible. With this also came the difficulty for creating simple platonic friendships that could last. This led up to my eventual graduation which nailed the final coffin in my youth life tbh.

Now going into college became a terrible experience. The first few months were met with anxiety and stress that only furthered my spiral out of control. During the time I was talking to one of my ex's (technically we only broke up due to family) and I felt everything was probably going go right in the end. But no, all I end up having the fun things we call anxiety attacks. This caused me to withdraw from everyone including my love interest who ended up finding another guy. 

Here I am now, feeling virtually stuck. Stuck going for a degree I don't want because I can't even handle the complexity of college. Stuck having to stare at the one who got away all because of this. Stuck in some limbo where anything I do just ends in total disaster thanks to my anxiety. 

My life sucks and it's all thanks to anxiety and depression."

One day everything is fine and dandy, the next, bad. Even the littlest things resort to me overthinking, bringing myself down, and eventually just shutting down completely.

My parents are no help whatsoever. Having ideals for me that I simply can’t meet anymore. Growing up I always followed their rules and orders, did well in school, no swearing, no alcohol, all those kinds of things. Depression was taboo. According to my family, it simply doesn’t exist. Recently, I lost my job and am basically being forced to apply to a job that I have absolutely no interest in. They are not helping my anxiety or depression. How can I express myself, without hurting others, but most importantly myself. 

I’ve never thought of hurting myself before, but lately it’s like, all I can think of. Lately I think of my life as not important. I haven’t amounted to anything like others around me have, so what does it matter? Anyway, I don’t intend on hurting myself but these thoughts are eating away at me. 

What can I do?"

rrnlv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rrnlv5/a_breakthrough/,A breakthrough?,13,1,1640824597.0,"I stopped answering my mom's calls. I should've done that 17 years ago when I moved out. But I allowed that bitch to keep a leash on me, allowed her to manipulate my emotions long-distance, allowed her to torture me, in the ill-fated hope of our relationship getting better.

I remember wishing she was dead when I was 14. That's how bad it was. And that wish never really went away, but I pushed it down, thinking that's not a normal thought! Kids are supposed to love their parents! Kids aren't supposed to wish their parents were dead! But I did, and I still do even 24 years later. It's that bad!

I allowed her to brainwash me (gaslight is the new hip term), that all my problems must be something I'm doing...  And in a way she was right! The wrong thing I was doing was trying to appease her by maintaining a relationship with her when I should have written her off the day I moved out.

This motherless modus is new for me

I hate my fuckin mom for how much she has controlled me. Despite trying to break away, I was never really successful. Now that I'm in my midlife (38 but close enough), I can't even fake it anymore. I hate her and I won't entertain her manipulations anymore.

Too little, too late? My nervous and unsure personality is well established and is a direct result of her. But maybe I still have a chance left to get something good out of life, to break out of the fucking mold I've been stuck in and be a new person.

Dad died about 6 years ago. He was also depressed and anxious and the same kind of fucked up that I'm heading to, and I think she was such a controlling maniacal bitch she created or exacerbated his problems. And always had a way to make it sound like she had the purest intentions. However, she now freely talks about how happy she is that he's dead.

I'll be even happier when she kicks off. Good fuckin' riddance, you old evil bitch. I never want to interact with you again. I don't want to go to your funeral. You have successfully expelled me from the family, a family that was ALWAYS dysfunctional and shouldn't ever have been a family. I am glad to be free of you.

If I had cut her off 17 years ago when I moved out, I think I would've had a shot at being a normal person. Has anyone else been successful at having a fresh start in their late thirties? Turning around the disaster that was their entire life and actually not being a hateful/hated/anxious/depressed bastard anymore?"

Lately I feel like I've been falling apart. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety when I was about 13 (I'm 25 now). To add up to it I'm also on the Autism spectrum (got an official diagnosis when I was 15). Although I do have a job and a couple of hobbies I just feel like I'm not going to get anywhere. 

Lately I feel like I'm just a loser with no future. I've been producing music for about a year now and I keep improving as I work every day and I'm hoping maybe I can do something with that but at this point I don't know if I will. The job I currently have I don't think I see myself lasting there any longer as I'm fed up with favoritism and ass kissing that goes on there. Its hard to quit a job right now though because of covid. 

I feel like maybe its my own fault, I didn't go to college because I thought it wasn't for me. Lately some of the people I grew up with are kinda talking down on me because they're graduating college and I didn't go to college. I actually cried a little bit this morning after staying up until 7 am. I'm tired of being seen as weak or not masculine because of my emotions.

Is it my own fault? Am I really worthless?"

Got up to prepare, eat breakfast, etc. And then suddenly get hit with an overwhelming sense of doom and melancholy out of nowhere. Paralyzed and in tears. 

Had to call off work. Now sitting on the couch almost frantically trying to find something on my phone to distract me and get rid of racing thoughts.

Feeling like a pathetic piece of crap.

""I'm sorry I can't make it to work tonight. I'm suddenly sad for no apparent f*cking reason and can't get my sh!t together enough to be a functional, responsible adult.""

I wish I could have just had a sh!tty cold, or a broken bone. Then at least I could seemingly have a legit reason to call off. But no, what's got me down on my knees, only I can feel and see.

I know, highs and lows come in the package. I guess I just wish I can also feel the highs as intensely as I could feel the melancholic lows.

I’m concerned about depression cause my favorite cousin committed suicide at the age of 32. He was all smiles, I never saw him sad. I could relate to him cause we were similar in many ways. When he committed suicide I was so confused becuase he was the happiest around everyone and was having a good life. 
 
I’m worried that I might be suffering from depression and end up doing what he did. I just feel that my life is too good to be sad or feel empty. I don’t know what’s going on.

I am still in college but I’m failing majorly so I feel like dropping out since I just feel too tired and no matter how much tutoring I get I just keep on failing my exams. And I am jealous of the few friends I have because they all seem so happy and content with life and then I keep wondering, how? What’s so great about all this, so I end up laying in bed for the most days that I do not have to go to school but then feel like a total loser for not doing anything. 
I have literally tried everything thinkable and I am still just not happy. I tried some many types of therapy and meds that I stopped counting, I have tried the whole working out thing, the going out thing: the traveling thing, the relationship/friendship thing, the volunteering thing, the any hobby that I can think of thing but I am just not happy, more so I am mostly frustrated all the time mostly from never feeling happy.

I typically cannot tolerate side effects from typical AD'S primarily emotional bunting, feeling like a zombie, sexual sides.

Due to this my psychiatrist recently prescribed me Mirtazapine but I have been a bit scared off but apparent sides of intense unavoidable weight gain, feeling tired, and unmotivated.

 One of the factors of my severe depression is lack of motivation and energy so I fear this might not be a good match.

I am severely depressed and really need to find a treatment that can work for me. 

Would anyone be able to help with recommendations for an AD that minimizes the sides I mentioned but is still effective?

I see my psychiatrist in 2 weeks and could possibly make  suggestions, I really desperately need to be on medication as my anxiety and depression are very severe.

One I often see mention is Trillitex for reduced sides, perhaps that could be an option.

Any feedback would really mean so much, thank you!"

My Context:  
I gradualy drifted into a depression at the age of 15 for various reasons. To name a few, I had a very difficult family-situation and lost all stronger bonds to familymembers. I had to switch schools and classes several times and lost contact to most of my friends in the process. I fell in love with a girl that rejected me and I never managed to get over it.

 Just to name a few.

At the Age of 18 I got stanionary after a suicide attempt (which was actually already my second) and after being heavily depressed for almost four years.  
The treatment didn't help at all (it even made some things worse) but somehow I survived for another year, when I finally met people that could support me in the way I needed (help for self-help).

With the help of a pastor and some very generous school principals I even was able to finally graduate.

So many things turned to the better in my life, I got things in order again (things like 'having a reason or justification to live and thrive' - actually knowing what I could and should do with my life and so on)  
eeexcept for one thing. My social life is still pretty much non-existent.  


Lonelyness was and is probably the primary reason why I got in a depression in the first place, and imo even is the main cause (in different variations) for a depression to fully develop.  
I tried and still try so hard to reconnect with lost, old friends, meeting new people. even though it is sooooo hard and hurtful, getting rejected or simply not getting anything back.

What boggles my mind the most atm is the realisation, that in the past 8 months I reached out to so many people, got socially active, made new connections and tried again and again to strengthen bonds, relationships, connections. In this 8 months i was at birthday parties, went into clubs with friends, went hiking, swimming, played various sports (volleyball, bike tours, football, you name it), went to events, groups - the list goes on.  
On every. single. occation (except ONE single birthdayparty in mid dec and my gaming friends) I was the one that inicciated the meet up, the joint exercisee, the hiking tour, the beer after work or every single other time I went out socialising with someone. Not a single person in the last 8 months (close family excluded) felt any need to actually spend time with me.

It just hurts too much :(

I mean like, I get it, not everyone would have fun with me spending time together. But not a single soul? out of the 100ds of people I met AND had fun with? Why am I, the one with social anxiety to be the one that has to make the first step every time?  
it's so ridiculously difficult for me to approach people, hook up with people, talk about my feelings, thoughts and what not, and I am the only that actually starts conversations or asks for meet-ups??  
this is so fucked up.  
How am I supposed to get back into any kind of social life if nobody wants to spend time with me?"

Im  going to keep this brief, nothing to in detail but I will give a quick  overview. I started dating my first ever girlfriend at the age of 15. We  were sweethearts but underneath the social side of things I was being  put through a lot. Growing up, I never saw a healthy relationship due to  family alcohol abuse and drug abuse. During my 2 years with this women I  had knives held up to me, was chocked out, hit with belts many times,  emotionally used, and financially abused. I know that is a lot to take  in with a single sentence and but it  is all true. I couldn't bring  myself to leave because I was an abosolute dumb kid.. still am. It has  been near 5 months of this and she continues to harass me as the days go  on. She pulled up to me while I was in my neighborhood taunting me  acting as if she was a random person that needed help. It was dark, so I  couldn't see it was her until she said something. I sped off and got  away. She also has showed up to my house asking why I hate her and I  tell her its because of the abuse. Now she has had sex with 7 more  people and im worried about her trying to get into my life.  I cant  sleep without waking up to an anxiety attack remembering things that  occurred like being forced to shower in front of her while she turned  off the hot water and poured ice cold water on me for her entertainment.  Its things like that that continue to hurt me everyday. I deal with the  guilt of me being to dumb to leave and just want to be happy. I did end  up grinding extremely hard after this relationship. I do weight the  most I ever have (I bodybuild), finished university (certificate for  cyber, think trade school but for security), and finished HS. I thought  maybe these things would make me happy but in reality I hate every  single day. Im sorry if this is a rant and all over the place but I just  want to know im not alone and how to deal with the fact I allowed  myself to be abused for so long and how to recover and accept."

I hope you found a guy who can treat you right because right now I’m in a relationship where I’m being used and hurt. Rn I don’t feel like I’m worth to be alive, everything I do isn’t worth living in this world. I’ll never amount to anything in life. I’m writing this because I personally don’t think I’m going to be on this earth much longer. I’m being mentally abused in my relationship. He has cheated not in person but through texts and pictures and porn. He won’t ever admit it but it’s true. All I wanted was to be happy, I don’t deserve this. That’s why I eat to hide the pain. He takes me out so much because he feels bad after. He hates that I’m fat and not skinny. He doesn’t even touch me no more, I feel ugly now. I’m a liar in everyone’s face. I’m going to try to live one more time by letting things go, and just act numb and not care. Even tho deep down I do. But I need to let it go and just let it happy to me. I wouldn’t get this if god didn’t think I deserved it. So I’ll just take my punishment. 
What’s the point of living in a world that you don’t amount to anything. I wish I could die but I don’t have the guts to kill myself. There’s nothing here for me, and no one cares about me. One day I’ll have the guts, good bye world. I’m sorry I failed your tests I guess they were to hard for me"

rrgi9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rrgi9w/apathy/,Apathy,1,0,1640806406.0,"I don't know what is going on with me. A couple of years ago i had depression and to cope i did some things im not proud of. I still haven't forgiven myself for them fully. I didnt hurt anyone or anything, but its stuff that was really sick. A few months after the episode subsided, when reflecting on my past actions, i realized what i did and how sick it was, and my OCD has been pestering me with guilt ever since.

I've been pretty alone the last few weeks, thanks to being in a foreign country with few friends, and as im inbetween semester and living on campus right now, nobody is around and i have little work (that i do have ive lost all motivation to work on). I should be greatful, i spent christmas with a 2nd cousin, and it was a good time. But then I left on the 27th, and got back to my dorm. I was really out of it that night, and just felt really down. I just felt exhausted and bored, so to quell those feelings i decided to watch a movie. Not thinking at all about ehat i was watching i turned on a film with a brutal rape scene in it (i didn't realize this when i picked the film) and when it happened, i felt nothing. Just apathy. Nothing sexual, nothing malocious, no empathy, no sadness, no shock. Nothing.  Except for that dull obsessive feeling, of wanting to do nothing and wallow in your own... apathy... As you can probably expect, there was lots of violence in the film as well, and i was numb to this as well. I hadn't watched movies or anything for weeks, there is no reason i should be so desensitized to anything like this. And instead of panicking like i normally do, i didnt. I just felt apathy. It didn't feel wrong. It felt boring, just as boring as the simpsons episode i watched right afterwards, or the videogame i played to try to take my mind off of it. This apathetic feeling was the same one i felt all those years ago, and I just don't know that to do. Ive called my parents, who love me, and i feel nothing when talking to them. I tried explaining my situation, and although they were receptive at first, they lost patience and yelled at me, telling me to snap out of it. Fuckin hell, if it were that easy! Ive spoken to them twice a day because I thought that it could make me feel something. And nothing. Im just an ungrateful little shit. I mean, i have the disciple at least now not to engage in self destructive behaviors, but all of a sudden all my supposed progress is gone. I feel like im reetering on the edge of going back to my old ways. Im still The shitty person i was, and im really starting to think that im incapable of change. The last two days ive gone between balling my eyes out and feeling this extreme apathy. Nothing in between. I sure as hell cant afford therapy, and neither can my parents. And im so judgemental. Im not this way at all normally. I just wanted to relax the other night, to just mindlessly watch something. And now i feel incapable of love. I know im freaking out a bit, but god damn, when i feel apathetic like that, its inescapable. I mean, its the weirdest feeling, as if everything seems so obvious, yet cause and effect are seemingly divorced from eachother.

Look, i just want to go back to when i was a kid, or even an early to mid teen. The world seemed so full of wonder then, i knew right from wrong, girls looked hot, i cared about people, i felt emotions, videogames were fun, movies were cool, i had friends. Sure, things weren't perfect, and nostalgia is definitely coming into play here, but damn, i didn't want to just rot in my room then, which is this feeling that just is overtaking me now. ive felt like shit for the last few years if you can't tell, and to escape the shittyness ive tried everything it seems. Drugs, nothing really (probably its in part due to the fact im a little affraid of them). Videogames, boring. Alcohol, i have a bit of a problem with, so to protect myself, no. Porn, boring, and also a big no, espiecally with all the rape thoughts ive been obsessing over thanks to my pal ocd. I actually havent used any of these escapes for a while now, as they just seem so hollow themselves, like they add nothing to my life. 

Honestly, i feel a little better after writing this, but knowing that darkness is inside of me, and can so easily overtake me is... Kinda pulling me back into it. I mean, i feel like i want to find something there that will push me to get out of it, but I'm just not sure there is that thing. All this stiff over the last few days started when i just wanted a break and to get some rest... And all this.

I know i sound crazy. This current barrage of whatever this is has been attacking me only 3 days now. But this feeling isnt new, it gets me sometimes, somewhat often now. Honestly, i just want someone to listen to me."

I've been breaking down to the point that my stomach hurts and now I'm gonna blame myself for not giving her enough attention and love. She was always so happy when someone would call her name.
(update) she's been diagnosed with diabetes that went for a long time, the symptoms only came now and even if she was treated it would cost thousands and she would be needed to be watched at all times, the only option was to euthanize her.

Well, here I am, December 29th, 2021, the second year of the pandemic. Woman, 28 years old. I quit my job 3 months ago and haven't gotten one yet. I have applied to some jobs that have excited me by their trajectory and culture, but they have not finally come out.

Right now I was scrolling LinkedIn, looking at the feed that can get a bit repetitive. I felt I needed to get this out of my chest. Hi Reddit!

I try to be optimistic, I know the capabilities and qualities that I have to do a job in an excellent way and exceed any expectations, but sometimes this just seems to be exhausting.

It's funny how in my opinion, there is either success or I prefer to die ... yes, it can be a joke in bad taste, but sometimes I feel that everything is so difficult... I feel so much anxiety and concern when applying for a job, at the time of the response for interview or at the time of clicking refresh to my email with the hope of a response that does not arrive.

I know it is very cowardly to think about die, and this is something that has always been in my head... 

I am motivated by my family, to see them happy, to give them what we never had. My desire has always been to make people happy, to improve everything in which I can intervene. This has been the case in my personal life and even more so in my work. Always looking to improve processes, have very good relationships with my team, achieve goals, always looking for the purpose of making customers happy.

It's pitiful... ashamed to accept that I am in a bad moment. I didn't tell my family that I had quit until 1 month after I did. Hoping not to be judged, hoping not to disappoint anyone.

Do I regret of quitting my job? Not at all. A job that was making my back and legs sick from sitting for so long, working more than 15 hours a day, management making changes that had no purpose and that added a lot more workload, clearly without monetary recognition.

I am perhaps sorry for not having already found a job. But, I tell you exactly what happened. I am looking for the job of my dreams, and this, do not think that it is to do nothing and get paid. I have always been a passionate person for what I do, who loves hard work and effort. I want a job where I can feel that my performance is making a change, where I can improve statistics, processes.

Money runs out and like everyone else, there are receipts, cards to pay, etc.

This makes me feel out of air, I feel like I'm suffocating...

I have never used the Reddit, I have checked it a couple of times. It seems to be a place where I can say what I feel, behind this screen, crying and sad. It's all about the money...

Even if no one sees this, I feel a little more free.

If only..."

I look around everyone else is getting to have some fun or at least able celebrate the progress they have made, and have something to show for it.

But it feels like those moments never happen to me. All i get is occasionally lucky, and i have to be ready at any moment for it or ill miss it. It makes me afraid to put my head down and work. But also afraid not to.

Every time i get excited about something i have to wait for it. People tell me, oh there will be time for that later, oh you dont need that, shouldn't you be focusing on more productive things. They have a point, sometimes you do need wait for stuff. 

Delayed gratification is a necessary and important part of life. But it feels like all i have is the delay. Gratification never gets here. the fun times never seem to come, i cant make them happen, i cant afford anything, i just have to be ready for whatever scraps the universe tosses me.

And it hurts seeing people effortlessly get what they want without having to deal with what i do"

I wanted to share a portion of my depressed thoughts. The thing is, I don't feel alone, or desperately need to have a person to validate me.

He's annoyed that I do things differently than, he does. I'm so sorry that, I will not sit in a STUFFY house. I'm not old. I refuse to not have any fresh air or, natural light coming in because YOU decide it's too cold when, it is 75 FUCKING DGREES OUTSIDE. I am sick and tired of this BULLSHIT.

But, close the oven door so, we don't get roasted too! No. He won't. Why? Because, he is bound and determined to piss me off. Some days, I think he sits silently and thinks of ways to aggravate me. He thinks because, he signed the house over to us, he can do the shit he does to piss me off. Even though the place has a 70 thousand dollar mortgage on it. He thinks because, he insists on taking us out to dinner every now and then, it is his lot in life to aggravate his son in law. I have made numerous sacrifices for this man and, he goes out of his way to piss me off. My wife says, I'm imagining this. So, I keep silent. I have no FUCKING escape! There is nowhere for me to go!

I have a younger sibling, she was born when I was 8 and I have been the one probably taking care of her the most since. My parents travel a lot, my older sister used to come home really late from school, and I would stay with my younger sister.And than she went to college and I started to spend even more time with my younger sister. It was never bad, but when symptoms of depression started to arrive 3 years ago, everything became much harder to do. Everything. Sometimes I cant stand the sight of her and I get so angry.

she is now 8 years old, and I am going to college next month, I cant help but feel relieved.

I have to bath her, feed her, play with her. She is a very clingy and affectionate girl so she always likes to be around me. I have recently been sooooo stressed and depressed, more than usual. This year has just been so hard, and I cant count the amount of times I had to stop crying to go give her food, or serve her every need cause my parent werent at home, or just didnt wanna do it. I feel so pressured to always remember everything. Pack everything, give her medicine, feed her, bedtime, play with her while I cant even eat. I cant sleep, it takes so long for me to even take a shower and I have to do everything for her I hate it. I hate it so much.

It isnt even her fault, that is why I feel bad, I just dont wanna do anything and I find myself growing resentment for her.

She is next to me now, in my bed, coloring a book, and I wanna quick her out of my room. I just wanna be alone but she is always there, I just wanna rest but she is always in my room. I wanna turn my brain of and sleep all day but I cant since I have to wake up and feed her and do this and that.

The area within these four walls , I once saw it as a safe place , has now become the very prison that is holding me captive. With each passing moon , the walls seem to inch closer closer yet I'm as powerless as a hatchling to stop it. My cries for help were never answered. I've ceased asking for help for quite sometime now. I've somewhat resigned myself to my faith. I don't think I've a fight left in me anymore. Fighting is futile anyway for who can alter the pre-written lines of destiny. It seems that I'm cursed , forsaken of companionship , stripped of all emotions that makes us human and condemned to a life of solitude. I feel as empty as a hollowed out tree. Everything human had been wringed out of me but my consciousness which makes it more unbearable. I'm forced to feel each agonizing minute as it passes.

It's like there's a heaviness in your body and it makes it difficult for you to breath. You can't exactly put your finger on where it exactly is but you're always aware of it's wretched existence.

I feel the heaviness increasing and I want to cry but I cannot. It's like something is preventing me. I feel so drained all the time. All I want is to close my eyes and let the darkness overtake me. It provides some much needed comfort from myself. And when I open my eyes , it's like the warm cover of darkness has been stripped only to be replaced with the blinding lights of life . I feel as vulnerable as an infant snatched from the protective arms of his mother.

I've tried to hurt myself in the past. Made incisions on my arms or simply punched the walls repeatedly until my knuckles were raw and bloody. It wasn't because I was seeking attention but I wanted to feel something , anything ! I wanted the physical pain to compensate for the emptiness that I was feeling. It didn't work.

I don't think people quite understand what hopelessness can do to a person.

I'm forgotten it seems. Everyone's occupied enough to notice my pathetic existence. I feel as if I've been stabbed through my heart with an icicle and no earthly fire is hot enough to melt it. 

Death is not exactly what I seek for I don't know what's going to happen after I die. Will i simply cease to exist ? Is there hell and heaven ?
What I seek is an escape from myself. For a chance to be anyone but me. I can't bear to be me any longer."

You know Roger's family from Lethal Weapon? A happy nuclear family and well paying job that requires some sort of skill. That's what a good happy life looks like to me. I want to be happy and comfortable, and when I envision my dream life, this is what I feel will make me happy. I'm filled with a sense of happiness when I imagine the life I want. But then out comes my deep hopelessness. 


There is a problem that comes into play. I strongly believe that the genetic intelligence required for what constitutes a happy health life are out of my reach. I feel inadequate in everything I do. I just finished a semester of college and I just feel a degree isn't worth it. What's the point of trying if my lack of intellectual make the life I want impossible to achieve? 



Either my belief is the true fact of the matter or it's due to a lack of self esteem. The way I see, both scenarios make me feel hopeless. If it's the former, life isn't worth living as there is practically no chance I will get that future life. My ambitions for a happy life are stunted by  low intelligence. If it's the latter, life isn't worth living either. What is the likelihood of perspective changing dramatically in mid to late adulthood given you've held on to it since childhood? In my non-professional opinion, not likely. 


Everyone says that with smart or hard work you can achieve anything. It's complete bullshit. Not all of us can be engineers and doctors even if we put in more effort than those with gifted intelligence. And I want to be clear, it's not that I've worked particularly hard. But I feel that working hard isn't even worth it given my lack of intellect. 


It makes me incredibly angry and sad knowing that I can work hard for something I want and will never achieve it due to shit outside of my control. There are people who live to achieve eons of happiness and comfort with just 5% of my effort. They will achieve the life I want and more. This just isn't fair given what I've been through. 


My high school experience was lack luster to say the least. I had some shitty teachers and my focus was non-existent. My absences were practically tolerated by my parents. I also had an abusive father when I was child and early teen. It wasn't so much physical abuse but the self esteem destroying type. He berated me and tore me down emotionally. I felt I couldn't be myself whenever he was around. I couldn't trust him so I couldn't be vulnerable around him. I was essentially a robot or zombie whenever he was at home. I was practically dehumanized as a child. I've lived in shitty housing and poverty stricken neighborhoods. I feel like I deserve a happy life in adulthood given the shit I've put up with in childhood. When do I get a chance to live an order of magnitude better than that? I deserve hard work to ""work"" for me. 


It saddens me greatly when I come across people from good families and great wealth achieve even greater wealth and happier families. I know that I cannot achieve even 5% of what they have and this just destroys me mentally. I'm deeply pessimistic about what the future holds. I don't want to be alive if I can't be happy and comfortable. Why live if there is no effort that makes the life that will make me happy possible? I'm not interested in trudging through life living pay check to pay check slaving away for medium wage scraps just to come home to a shitty relationship with an abusive spouse. I'm not interested in poor housing and non-existent educational opportunities for my children. All the facets of an unhappy life I mentioned were the lives of my parents, and the lives of my grandparents. This is the life that awaits high ambition and low intelligence."

I dont really know how to start this but I feel like i am running out of options so I guess ill turn to writing as what feels like the last resort.

Something inside is causing so much pain. Where, why, WHAT especially I would love to know. I am losing myself and everything that i had in me. Its like someone flipped a switch in the darkest corner of my brain and I do not have access to that part. Yet i am going down the darkest parts of my thoughts and mind trying to find sed switch, hoping that it will be around the next corner to only find yet another pit or tunnel. 

I feel lost, scared and emotionless but yet I feel so much. I could name more things i feel but i honestly cannot be bothered as I dont even know if some of things I feel are actaully real. It has been a bad year. Good things have happened but yet I am stuck in this space and I cannot break free. Ok i am in therapy and i will be starting treatment and i cant lie that does give me hope but it also scares me because what if it changes me to someone yet again that i do not know. I am just a body right now, I feel like i do not have a true soul anymore, its too damaged. Or lost. Or repressed by whatever it is holding me down. I think I have depression, well im kinda sure.. You dont feel these things without being depressed right ? But why am I depressed ? I have no reason ??? There are people out there that are a lot more worse off and I feel like im just complaining and that I should just get a grip and get on with it. Yet thats impossible. After many conversations with you I thought we had started to sort things out.. This going back around in circles constantly is draining and I wish I didnt have so much hope when I started to feel better because this wouldnt hurt as much now. Im dissapointed. Disspaointed in myself for letting myself get so low, get so stuck and what feels hopeless. You know what is one of things that really puts me off balance, sometimes I look at myself in the mirroir and i dont know who is looking at me. Its not the same as when you get a new haircut and keep catching yourself in the mirroir, or when youve put make up on for the first in ages or even when youre hungover and look as shit as you feel. It feels genuinely like Im seeing a stranger for the first time. Sure i know the features but theres something in the eyes. I see the sadness and I feel tha pain of this person and if it were anyone but myself I would probably reasure them but then the crashing realisation that its me hits. Then this stranger I see in the mirroir quicklu becomes someone i depise and want to get rid of out of my life. But shes sad and needs help but I fucking hate her. Shes stopping me from doing what I know I can do and want to do. I dont even want to be around myself and I understand that other people dont. My close friends and boyfriend have tried so much and yet here I am not getting anywhere. All because of this stranger in the mirroir who is haunting me. The stranger is sucking the life out of me and my soul. Im 24 and these should be the best years of my life and yet I think everyday about when this feeling(s) will stop and when I'll be ok, knowing that, that will probably never be the case and I should stop it myself. Thats when the thoughts get dangerous and scary because i dont want to kill me but the stranger I see. Unlucky for me this stranger doesnt exist without me even if I am trying to exist without her, I now feel like I do not exist without this stranger. So im stuck. What more do i have to do? How much more time can I wait ? Do I still have enough power and hope in me to beat this ? I dont know anymore. It hurts. 

Ive tried talking and telling to my family how I feel but theres nothing to be done. Im losing contact with them slowly so if i do lose this battle maybe it would hurt them less. I need to protect people from me. From this destructive path im on. 

I am now crying too much to put this down into more words so until maybe next time, please keep going, I dont want to lose you completely yet. 

From 

The stranger that lives in you.  "

At the age of 37, I find myself right back at step 0 or even less, divorced, single, no friends, no job, no family...I do not even remember the last time I genuinely laughed out loud, I spend most of my days talking to myself or the couch and it has been like that for a good solid 6 years although the divorce was back in 2015 I thought I will be better off this marriage thing (and I do not regret it), more time to myself and doing the fuckever I want and having more money (till I lost my job and currently running on my life savings which are almost up). 

Another new year coming up, obviously, I can go out and attend any new year party and pretend I'm happy however I quit drinking so it will be quite hard to pretend, instead, I will just feel sorry for myself watching all the people around me, so I would rather spend it on my couch.   


Is there anything out there waiting for me? You know how you sometimes think your time will come eventually, I mean life can't suck forever, its got its highs and lows but deep down the idea that I will die alone is sinking in deeper, I can't trust humans anymore, last time I had sex was with my wife (that is almost 6 years) yea I can go out and play the player game but I can't be with anyone unless I genuinely have feelings towards them and right now I feel I will never find such a person especially with my difficulty in trusting anything let alone falling in love with someone. I don't even comment on things or post stuff this is not even my real name, but heck who cares, I don't even know why I am posting this, maybe just letting the world know how fucked up it has become or maybe I am the fucked up one either ways I am finding it really difficult to keep pushing through this thing called life and I thought I throw it out there to anyone who is struggling as well, you are not alone and I really wish and pray we will find our way out of that barrel, but I still have a single thread of hope that maybe just maybe life will be kind to the unfortunate someday."

I love my gf(ex) very much. And she too care about me. But the thing is I'm at age of building my career and I'm too much concerned abt that.

 But my ex wasn't that serious abt her dreams n goals. She remains unstable for most of the time due to her family issues. I tried motivating her but didn't work. I'm tired of her tantrums. I think in between that i lost my interest upon her. She wants me to call her, text her spend time with her. But i don't want to coz i think it's waste of my time instead i work toward my goals.

 Was is the right decision to dump her. It's been 3 days we haven't talked since then she blocked me as usual from every social media.
At the time of break up she told me that she still loves me n that i can come back to her anytime. I think her love for me is true but her nature drives me nuts. What to do I'm so much confused.
Anyone please give me some good opinion. 😕"

I am currently in the system now until march for my behavior (by in the system I mean on court ordered treatment) . I feel like a broken man, always being criticized for being depressed when that’s just the way I am.

I’ve been homeless since I was 16, fending for myself and trying to use the time and energy I have to get a solid living situation, but there’s something that happens to ruin the situation or make it hard for me to stay. There’s no solid resources in my area as far as I have experienced. Halfway houses full of drama, bugs, thieves, fighting, etc.. 

I’ve been in the legal system as well since 16. The situations that have occurred happened due to in my opinion the frustration from being depressed and the outcome of this. I can’t say no to drugs and that’s making me feel weak and like a pushover. From Rehab center to inpatient treatment to transitional living, years of bouncing around like a football from a nfl game is not a healthy way to live and I’m losing my mind. 

I’m supposed to check into another rehab center tomorrow as I’ve been using street drugs on and off, and hopefully I can make more progress with this attempt to get sober. I have a plan. I know I have to put in the work to maintain a clean self which means aa meetings, routine exercise, and just the healthiest I can be physically and mentally. 

Any feedback is welcome I just want to see what people think about my life and maybe how I can improve in any way. Thanks"

ive been told i’m a selfless person who simultaneously receives criticism on being selfish. so which one is it? 

i know i can’t please everyone; being a people pleaser might even be one of my red flags. but if that’s the case, then when should i know to do things for my own benefit? 

i know for my own personal health and mental state, cutting ties or minimizing the relationship i have with my family would not only improve my quality of life, but theirs in the long run too. knowing this, however, has always posed so many moral and ethical questions. who am i to make that decision for them? am i being ungrateful for everything they’ve done to support me? shouldn’t i put myself first since it’s my life? isn’t it my choice to do this especially after everything i feel as if i’ve sacrificed and have done for them? 

it’s so hard to be perfect. my parents have always told me i have all the excuses in the world, but why is it i am capable of holding myself accountable and be the one to say sorry? why is it that their traditional views on parenting can’t coexist with american modern parenting (in that we share a mutual respect)? 

at the end of the day, i know i love self-sabotaging and self-destructing. and i KNOW it hurts them. it hurts me to see me being the cause of their pain, but only if they’d understand me when they were actually the start of mine. 

what is a girl supposed to do? i’m incapable of thinking straight or maintaining genuine feelings at this point. everything is a contradiction and i just don’t know what to do anymore."

But then once I started college I just became a mess. Which is when recently I was diagnosed with everything mentioned aside from ADHD.

Everyday I struggle to keep my BPD thoughts from impacting me. I’m always getting mad at my friends who only care about me. They don’t have anything against me, it is just all in my head. 

I don’t understand what I did to deserve this life. 

My parents are also narcissistic so that’s adds on top of the problems I’m dealing with.

I don’t have the energy to vent anymore. I’m just tired of life. I don’t see it getting any better. I can’t even get therapy because my parents control everything in my life. 

I tried recently to explain to my parents how I went behind their backs and got diagnosed. But they didn’t even care and got mad at me.

At a point, I think I gave up on myself, gave up on waiting for help. Accepted the abuse and stopped trying. I thought that I'd get up and leave and be happy but now it just seems like a waste of time.

I'm not cut out for that life. Not pretty, smart or driven enough. I hate that but I know I can't change it. I just feel like I'm worth nothing and like this is as far as my story goes and that I'll be left as some nobody, and for the first time I'm okay with that.

I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't care about it much but for some reason, I keep hoping that I'm wrong and help will come. I just want all of this to end. I'm scared it never will.

From hindsight I was gaslighted during my relationship when my ex would blame me for the reason why she had to abort our accidental child. I “manipulated” her into getting the procedure. In especially the month of October I pretty much felt dead inside and I would literally visualize like her, a makeshift child, and myself. It was fucking horrible. Afterwards I was dealing with obsessive thoughts about my jealousy on what she was doing and if she was moving on and whatever. It fucking sucks because I work a sales job so at the same time I’m forced to act joyous and happy in the day time when internally I genuinely want to end it all. Hearing my housemates have sex literally reminds me if my ex is having sex with someone else. If I walk past by a couple or if I see a food place we went to, I immediately think about my ex like instantly. The topic of sex, intimacy, or coupling just makes me so jealous and sad. If I find casual sex with a girl, I immediately feel empty right after and think about what my ex is doing. I’ve been working out so much and I’ve been looking a lot better and I go out in the day and I smile like everything is okay. My friends knew I was depressed before but now they think it’s all alright. In reality I genuinely want to die. Sorry this was a long rant. I hate the lifestyle my housemates live of just hooking up and partying. I’m over that now I wanna do real stuff. Point is I’m very very lonely I just want a hug man, I wanna stop having an unhealthy relationship with sex and jealousy feelings, work is getting stressful because I need to hit my Quota, I’m just so annoyed and tired all the time.

Hi, I (38f) have recently ended a 4yr situationship (not amicable, nor my decision).  The person relocated to an entire different continent.  This is has conjured a slew of never before experienced aftermath.  I’m 38 so this is far from my first ending, relocating either on my behalf or theirs has always been a factor.  Followed by the traditional NC.  This ending followed the same formula.  But THIS time, THIS has summoned a slew of all new aftermath.  I have accepted that I have always had mental health issues, yet was “fortunate” enough to navigate around them. I have also accepted that this emotional state is not the smartest time to get a clear perspective on my specific defectors.  

This situationship was largely based and rooted in mental health and self harm and suicide attempts (that I was never supposed to be home for, but would pop up for some random ass reason and fuck up plan).  Depression had a major authority of our days potential for what could or couldn’t get accomplished.  I NEVER seen this as a deal breaker (and not bc I wanted to save them) but bc They WANTED to help themselves, and it’s not in me to quit on ANYONE that’s wants to improve, but may need some unconditional cheering along the way.  And of course , I loved this person, but I’ve done the same thing for people I have Never had any amorous fancy for. 

 There were times this depression was a major ass inconvenience and frustrating AS FUCK!  but NEVER, did I blame or shame the person for their depression.  Never did I taunt, tease, bully, manipulate, or bring up as any form of a negative factor.  NEVER did I allow anyone else or themselves for that matter do any of those things either. And with their effort/desire for a different life, Much trial and error, and much trust / understanding; we as a team Developed some tools to help navigate through depression.  Once progress gained traction, Real Lasting Results were achieved.  

Part of me is wondering though, if part of my understanding for the situation came From Understanding.  I never really shared much of my relatability to their situation.  I didn’t want to be that person that is the ‘me too’ friend or do anything to have the focus be shared.  By all rights, I was “managing” mine and my shit paled in comparison to the volatile shifts depression would thrash them through.  And although they shared expressions of gratitude, I think it was only surface level.  But I appreciated the appreciation so I wasn’t going to shit on their expressions.  

Enter present time, they went back and forth between NC and full on engaging in conversation.  Then one day within a matter of an hour and a half, they went complete NC.  Which I respect, (honestly) as part of their reason for leaving was to HEAL.  And I can understand keeping communication with me I’m sure muddles this process.  Then after 2 weeks or so, I came across a post where they were completely shitting on me (with fabrications on top of that) ON A POST THEY MADE about missing me.

I privately confronted them.  And have let it be.  But my current brain space has had to acknowledge some things.  1) I said I understand his choice to go NC, so the following statement SHOULDN’T matter.  (but there are a lot of things not mentioned that lead to there needing to be a follow up to my previous statement).  2) I WOULD BE HURT AND SAD BY THE NC, but I would RESPECTFULLY understand and deal with it, knowing it was part of the process.  as NC is to preserve one’s mental fortitude and is necessary at times.. however ..the silent treatment, is VERY different (in my understanding) as it’s a weaponized withholding of love/affection for punishment.  ummmmmm, I’m currently confused on why I’m not just able to take this L instead of being furious at the situation.  I’m confused on if I’m angry bc this is intentional hurt, bc the “managed” grip I had on my mental health issues wants to give way but I’m not confident in my own self cheerleading skills, or if I’m becoming depressed and self doubting as the result of dealing with a narcissist.."

After not being able to sleep properly for the last couple of months (for perspective I slept more and better with a newborn in a cot next to me) and having a rough birth (episiotomy and forceps delivery as my labour stalled when I was fully dilated to to an Autism mental breakdown and being unable to cope) it felt lovely to just lie on the bed and relax. 

I was drifting in and out if sleep while the midwife was doing whatever, just happy I had my baby and that it was all over and I could rest. Then my blood clots were discovered and there was about 10 members of staff all flooding into the room, I was low on oxygen so they put the mask on me and they were talking to me trying to keep my conscious. I knew it was serious by the look on my husband's face but I didn't care, I didn't even try to fight to stay awake, I just wanted to sleep. The moments I was unconscious were so peaceful and painfree it was lovely and freeing. I think this is one of the best feelings I have had in my entire life, it's really hard to rank them when this feeling just feels so engrained in my head.

I think all the crazy hormones had been overriding all of this as it didn't bother me for months but recently my mental health has taken a big downturn and all the pregnancy hormones are a great deal lower as I am not doing much breastfeeding anymore. I am struggling to sleep at night and in the daytime I just feel tired and irritable. In the past I have contemplated how I would like to just be dead and no longer have to deal with depression and now I have this feeling of a peaceful passing it's just haunting me, also taunting me. 

I always wanted to have at least 2 children but pregnancy and childbirth were so awful I don't know if I can go through it again. The pregnancy hormones were so crazy and mind altering even when I was in labour I was screaming next time I wanted a cesarean but now I can barely stomach the idea of doing it all again. I am concerned that if my mental health gets worse I may decide to get pregnant again for the wrong reason (wanting to try for that peaceful passing I nearly had before) and instead be stuck going through a distressing labour and being denied a cesarean as I had fully dilated so quickly. 

I just can't sleep and my thoughts of all of this are keeping me up at night and I needed to write it all down for some reason."

We lost a handful of employees the weeks following (for whatever reason) and we're down to the like 5-10 (including me) now and that's quite low for the second shift.

I'm not very close to any of the employees including the three who left (and I'm not blaming them for what happened) but I did appreciate having company around me and I made small talk with them. Hearing them chit chat and laugh during break/lunch, walking out with them after work, all that.

Nothing traumatic or bad has ever happened to me which I am thankful for but at the same time I wish I had something that I could fix in my life so I could pretend like I'm getting better and improving.

Five years later, as of a few weeks ago, I came out of hiding finally and reached back out to those people I had just vanished on for years. It meant so much hearing how much I mattered and they missed me. And the worst one- the relationship that went south, I reconciled with them too. Having a chance to talk and apologize for our mistakes. It gave me closure for wounds I’ve let bleed for half a decade in silence.

This was the biggest mistake I’ve made, so please, consider restoring connections with those you’ve missed, do what you can to mend and forgive. Living in hate and spite is not survivable. I wish I could go back and change things. I’ve ruined my life over running from my past. Don’t do what I did."

I get home and i feel this sudden sadness…this emptiness. Its like a void inside my stomach thats eating me alive, robbing me from all emotion. I go to my hidden stash because thats where i keep my depressing remedy. I pop a pill and crush another one. Snorting it till my head kicks back like that 45 my dad let me handle before he died. I sit for a good 15 minutes feeling nothing, my body is numb. I open up my phone and go to Reddit because for some reason i feel like an anonymous person reading my miserable story will help them not feel alone….. well thats all i hope YOU the person reading this does better than me i know its a shit show but just keep pushing…..

rr0my3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rr0my3/thoughts_for_supporting_a_romantic_partner/,Thoughts for supporting a romantic partner,2,3,1640756936.0,"My (34m) partner/wife (35f) started experiencing symptoms of depression soon after our one and only kid (5f) was born. It hasn't gotten better now after a few years of meds and therapy, at least from my perspective.

She recently told me that she doesn't really look forward to anything in life. When she thinks about a family trip we have coming up, the feelings that come up are stress and anxiety. She denies any suicidal intention, is open with me that she sometimes longs for death, just to not have to deal with any of it anymore. 

She still laughs, keeps in close touch with two of her close friends, and is a BAMF at her full time, demanding job. She functions. Totally has it together, 100%, from the outside looking in.

But I feel like she has this sense of despair and hopelessness that can express sometimes at home, in interactions with both myself and our kiddo. She is still a great mom but it is hard for me to say that she is a great partner at the moment. Life is demanding and my needs are not something she has a great deal of ""space"" or ""emotional bandwidth"" for very often. At least, that is how I feel. It is all she can do to get through the day until the kid is put to bed, often. 

I am struggling lately with what I can do, both for her and myself. I know that I cannot by force of will pull another person out of a depressive state. But when she basically tells me that she doesn't experience joy anymore, I am at a loss as to what to do or say, other than to listen and be there. I want to be a support for her. A counterweight to the factors contributing to her depression. But I do not know what that looks like.

And in the meantime I have been struggling myself with a loss of intimacy, of carefree playful love, and of the sense of security of my partner's perceived happiness. And that is to say nothing of several other marital struggles we have experienced in the past few years. 

If anybody has thoughts on how to nurture a vivacious romantic relationship with a person struggling with depression, I would very much appreciate it."

I just don’t know what to do, I can’t talk to my family or friends because I’m supposed to be the “strong one”. My family hates any sign of vulnerability from me because I’m the oldest and I’m supposed to be the role model. I don’t know how to tell my friends I’m suffering so much and I have no other option but to continue pulling through or just give up. My cousin already committed suicide and I saw how much my family suffered including me. I hate everything about where I am and anything that awaits me. I’m just so lost and I don’t know what to do.

I am not poor ,so  I feel so bad for complaining when I am in a fortunate enough situation. But I’m enrolled in a great school that  my family honestly can’t afford, even if we aren’t poor. I’m just so afraid  that if I am not smart enough  to finish this degree that I started which everyone has already given so much money to help me complete. I hate it, but I’m so close to being done but it’s killing me. 

I hate seeming so shallow. But I’ve never felt so worthless before. I just know if I don’t finish college I’ll be worthless, even if it’s a degree in something I hate. 

I’m so sorry if this post seemed as if I was bragging about anything. I know I am more fortunate than others but I don’t know how to deal with these feelings of not being enough and I am really struggling."

I just feel let down by everyone who's supposed to care and help me. Since I had my daughter last year, nobody in my husband's family really checks in on me. It's especially hard because I don't talk to my own family. I just don't feel supported. I've never felt so lonely in my life. 

I texted different people in my husband's family about how I was struggling with the baby by myself (husband was out of state for work for 4 months) and nobody responded to me. My MIL never texted me back, never called me, nothing. My SIL said she was too busy lately to talk. They all knew I was struggling with mental health and physical health problems but nobody asked me about my heart or my wrist or how I was coping with a new baby by myself. Husband came home from out of state and all we do is fight. 

I just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up sometimes. Or I wish I could wake up as someone else. But I can't because I have a daughter now. Wanting not to be here anymore isn't an option anymore because of my daughter and I couldn't ever leave her anyway. But I'm so lonely. And I don't know how to cope. And it makes me miss my mother because she had it worse than me but I can't talk to her anymore.

And my sister is in basic training and I miss her so much my heart is broken. And my favorite dog is dead. I just want my husband and I to stop bickering. I want my medication to work already. 

I'm fine. Not in danger or anything. I guess I'm just venting. I'm just having a hard time."

I've tried therapy for a bit through my school's counseling services but my contact in the program quit and I sort of fell off too. These days I just sit and distract myself for 90% of my waking hours. I go to a pretty good school but I've begun to fail classes in the past year and no one other than me knows. I've tried to go easier on myself and tell myself that it's ok to mess up. But I just keep losing parts of myself that I value because of it. 

I smoke a lot of weed, I'm pretty much high throughout the day, and I drink before bed every night. It's really the only thing that alleviates it for a bit. I've been home for the holidays and due to omicron I have to be here for abt 3 more weeks. I really don't know what to do if I can't get my hands on something. I've been smoking cigarettes since my freshman year and it's about a pack a day so that's tough to go without too. 

Is there anything easy and soft I can do to lessen the pain without regular access to drugs? I really have no clue how to move forward from here and I'm panicking."

I was exceptionally well in my earlier years at school so my parents decided to send me to live in another place on my own where there were good educational institutions that would get me into a top level college. But the exact opposite happened. It started with missing out classes, binging tv shows 24x7 and eventually I got myself indulged with bad company, liquor & weed. Noone ever forced me to do anything it was always my initiative and i slowly had mastered this habits or i atleast thought i had. From a studious popular kid I went to a spoiled bully-ish brat and I was having a great time too. Everyone respected me when i smoked the most amounts of weed or took down 10 shots in one go. But it all went down when our college entrance exam’s results got out and my parents really got to know what was going on. I was grounded for 2 months in our home. Forced to prepare for more entrance exams and was terribly depressed at the moment which was totally ignored by my parents but eventually things got back to normal and somehow i maneged to convince my parents to send me back to the same place where i was preparing for my entrances for one more year. By the end of that year I had become a full blown drug addict and got involved with even worse company and illicit activities but still somehow i managed to score decent marks to get like a tier 3 college but my parents insisted i choose a college in my hometown which i thought was not a big deal since i would be in college but i did not realise that their supervision of me would affect me so hardly as i had been freely for almost 3 years. Throughout the first year the weed and alcohol had continued and i started missing classes here in college too. Didn’t even give the final exams too and then came the Covid. A perfect chance to redeem myself by staying at home and focussing on myself but instead what do i do? Lie about my online classes, smoke weed NOW IN MY HOME and do nothing. And by the second year of covid i had enough and my tolerance of stress levels reached a breaking point and i tried finish myself but got somehow saved and now I’m on meds and therapy but none of it seems to work so occasionally i binge drink or smoke again. But the main issue is now that my family has told me to take my own time I’m feeling more and more worthless without any motivation to do anything productive and it’s just me playing fifa all day and get annoyed at my family."

It was true beauty. It was my life's philosophy coming to play. I experienced the true beauty of humanity. For some reason, it made me really emotional. Probably because the dancers and singers were so into the music, that they didn't care about anything else. They were enjoying life, living deliberately and were completely present in that very moment. Their smiles and gleaming eyes. They had expressions of happiness that you just cannot fake. It made me reflect on my life right now. I'm stuck in the same old rat race like everyone else. Feelings of freedom and independence are long lost in today's world. From trends to traffic, to tension, to violence and war and confusion.
We have forgotten the true essence of a wild man's dreams. We all have crazy dreams, but not everyone is crazy enough to run after those dreams. To pursue them. I watched passion and human innovation, and it deeply made me sad when I realized that the lives those dance troops led was something I wanted to do. To run free and live on the road. Share happiness and live, not for the sake of it, but to truly live and suck the marrow out of life. Yet here I am, stuck in one of the most competitive schools in an Asian country with parents who have been told the same great big lie from their friends and fathers. Taught to be slaves in a modern corporate world. I'm stuck in having to complete the tedious yet pointless duty of school and college. Running free and wild, like wild horses in grasslands and rivers flowing through mountains and lush green grasslands. That's where I wanted to be.

I take venlafaxine 225mg daily and honestly I feel like it hasn’t been working. I haven’t talked to me therapist in a few weeks because she canceled our last couple of appts. I just feel numb and like I’m floating thru life now. 

I used to be addicted to adderall and weed. I haven’t used either in a while but I just don’t see the point in avoiding the weed anymore if things don’t get better without it. 

I had stopped SH for a few months and then I relapsed the other night. I didn’t do any bad damage, but I just wanted to feel the pain. I was tired of feeling nothing. 

I keep getting urges to cheat on my fiancé, snort adderall, smoke, or spend a lot of money. Just something new in my life that would make me feel something. But ultimately all of these things will make me feel worse in the long run. 

I can’t just keep doing this. I feel like I just go through the motions each day and I get no long term satisfaction from anything I do. I live with my parents still and while I love them, they stress me out beyond belief and I really can’t stand them 90% of the time. 

I just need something to change, but idk what. I want to switch my med but what if that makes me even worse? I just feel lost."

So my question is: how do I keep from spiraling down even more? Who tells me that in 2, 3, 10 years things will not get even worse than they are now?"

Like its been years since I have been at a normal state of mind lately I have been at a constant extreme amount of stress. I have my parents to worry about because I know that as soon as we interact my mom is going to push my buttons and force me into a disstresfful state and my dad won't give a shit about whatever i'm doing if he has a task he'll just start barking orders at me like a godamn drill sergeant that you can only say yes to.

Ugh as if that wasn't enough I have to worry about finding a reason to live cause frankly I got none I don't have a job, I Don't have friends, Every Girl that I talk to just ghosts me for no reason or based on prejudices they've accumulated from past relationships and on top of all that I need to deal with a huge amount of haters that are just trying to kill me with negativity i'm not even joking they're trying to hurt me but because it's not physical no one bats an eye.

All my friends are gone I don't even want to talk about it it's just so lonely and every relationships i've had so far were complete disasters and those that were good just ended in me being ghosted.

I can't be the real me because no one cares about me. I have broken a code in the universe and now they're all trying to finish me this is making more and more sense when you consider how shit my luck is and how unfair my odds are. i'm outnumbered and outgeared. On the enemy side there are Guys that just need to bully me for being different, Girls that hate me for not being bad boy and giving too much of a damn. I care too much and I love too much and that's the greatest turn off ever apparently because out of the 100s of people i've talked to only a few appreciated that I gave such importance and treated them fairly, Religious people are also after me for the obvious reasons that they're after everyone that doesn't bend to they're rules and lastly even the supernatural forces of nature are hellbent on killing me because WHY NOT!!

Every single thing so far been pushing me to suicide and at this point they really are succeeding because between my Depression PTSD Anxiety Bipolar Dissociative I don't know who the fuck between them will kill me first I struggle more and more to come back from a depressive disorder and it's not fun I have lost most if not all my appetite so far and I'm Still being pushed even further down the rabbit hole and It showing no signs to stop.

It doesn't matter what I do. Who I am. Who I act like. What I act like.

Things just keep turning out the same way no matter what I don't even know the fuck I am at this point I look in the mirror and I feel more like I'm looking at someone i'm familiar with rather than my own self I have trouble recolleting what my hobbies and interest are because I genuinely go so much with the flow that it carried me away now I'm just stuck in that river drifting away and i'm not sure I want to stop and save myself anymore.

I was dreaming that someone is going to come for me and save me from all this distress and torment.

I was hoping that someone would show up to save my day and heal me put me back on my foot and make me walk 

BUT NO NO NO NO NON ON ON O NO N!!!!

EVERYONE WAS LIKE RELATIONSHIP ABOUT HEALING YOU OR SAVING YOU BLA BAL REEALTIONSHIPS IS  BORING SHIT AND JUST FUCKING!!!.

ugh I love the song. someone you used to loved because it just makes me feel that i'm not the only one that needs someone to come and heal my heart and that i'm not the only one who's bleeeding from all these injuries I got in my heart.

I want to love and I want to have a girl to build my future with but NO NO NO NO NO Every girl compatible with me will just leave or ignore me for A BAD BOY WHO WILL never love them like I would and Everyone who takes interest in me are people that need to be protected themselves.

honestly I don't know anymore

I already know that whoever will read this post will start throwing stones at me in the comment or my dms and everyone is going to be like. Yes they're right let's just fucking assault me because I haven't suffered enough.

I don't know anymore.

rqvlhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rqvlhe/death_phobia_after_traumatic_event_and_overall/,Death phobia after traumatic event and overall depression,1,1,1640741679.0,"I'm currently M19 and have been long suffering with depression and anxiety since about 12 years old after undergoing a major surgery and being in a mentally abusive relationship for four years, among other things. I'm now in a very happy relationship and have been for a year and a half.

My fraternal twin brother on November 12th of this year was involved in a car accident where the other driver crossed the median on a state highway and hit him head on. The other driver was pronounced dead, and her passenger later succumbed to his injuries a month later due complications from the accident combined with COVID. My brother thankfully survived with two broken femurs, a broken tibia, a broken heel, and broken clavicle (shoulder, from the seatbelt).

In the past two weeks, I've come up with a severe phobia of death, of my own and of my family. This comes extremely out of the blue for me, but I sort of understand why.  It's important to note a few things: 

* at the same time this phobia has started, I've been on Latuda 20mg and Buspirone 5mg for about a month. This has helped tremendously with my depression, and a bit with my anxiety, but seems to not help at all with this phobia. 
* I'm in college and just finished up my exams December 10th.
* I'm in a long distance relationship and this phobia started the day of or MAYBE a  couple days before I left on my flight to see my girlfriend. I can't even remember exactly. I always think of everything in numbers, and especially time. I always manage to condense 2 weeks and 6 days into just ""2 weeks"" and etc. and tricks like that to make the time seem smaller - which works amazing for that, but when I'm scared of  time being so short, it's terrible. 

I'm managing to condense my whole life down to where I'm basically scared my life will end tomorrow. I'm scared of ridiculous things like the world ending and killing us all. I am scared of death and that I will somehow still be conscious infinitely and stuck endlessly tormented by being non existent but thinking. I am scared of time.

I've always one to cope with joking and holding off my emotions. I do not show my emotions to many but my girlfriend. I think I've been in a guarded mode, going back and forth to the hospital, taking care of my family, etc. and constantly moving and somewhat thriving off the purpose that college stress gives me. I'm thinking travelling maybe signaled my guard to go down and is making me really deal emotionally with the accident now.

Today has culminated in a panic attack and I've been crying over this the past couple days because of the extreme fear and anxiety I'm getting. Many say that life goes by fast, and it does, but in the rational side of my head (which wasn't doing anything for me and still isn't - but typing this out is slightly therapeutic), I know the 60-70 years left I still have isn't going to go by that quickly. It's a long, long time. But I also am worrying how my parents and grandparents feel, and that one day I will feel like that (""my life is half over - I've already done this once, so this will past by basically tomorrow""... etc.)

Has anyone else who deals with their emotions similarly faced a major traumatic event and/or come up with the same or similar phobia? How did you deal with it?  Is there a scientific explanation for my guarded mode? Can I expect this phobia to dissipate over time? This is the worst type of anxiety I've ever dealt with and it's making 24/7 hell. I feel so helpless and in despair and I just want to feel better again."

I cannot stand being a failure. I can’t do college and I’ll never make as much money as I want in other fields. I am nervous about everything all the time. I’m basically nocturnal, I’m on a crazy amount of meds, and I hate almost everything about myself. I don’t feel like I’m not loved, but I’m not respected. There are three people who exist that I care about whatsoever. Everyone else could die and I couldn’t care less. Everything I’m good at makes no money. Im not stupid, but I have such bad ADHD that I can’t use the intelligence I do have to do anything useful. I feel neutral or bad almost all the time. The only thing that helps is being with the three people I like, shopping, and doing drugs. I cannot be happy in normal life. I genuinely consider killing myself all the time because of extremely trivial things, because I just hate doing them that much. Like before I dropped out I genuinely would consider running into moving traffic so I could avoid going to class. My brain always is thinking of ways to get out of things and they usually involve serious injury or death for myself or another person. I also hate my body and I need like thousands of dollars of plastic surgery. I have a pretty severe shopping addiction and as a result of that I have no money. Yesterday I applied for a job, which I really hope I get, because I don’t think I can mentally handle going back to my old career. I would just try to shut my organs down from sheer will when I was there. I don’t feel like a person. I don’t feel like I have any gender, and I don’t feel like a human being. I feel like a spirit or like a god or something. I shouldn’t have a physical form. Having a body feels wrong to me. Maybe that’s why I’m always getting high, cause I feel like my real self, Not a human. I am constantly disassociated. My brain feels thick, like my thoughts are trying to swim through molasses. The brain fog is so bad I can barely think. I hold back tears when I do basic tasks. A week ago I got so bored that I little ripped off little bits of my skin. Literally doing anything is borderline physically painful. I would literally rather get beat up than sit through a math class. My brain is broken. My literal being hurts. My spirit is broken. I’m so stressed about being a failure that I consider killing myself every day. Then I would be dead and not an idiot college dropout with a shopping addiction and drug dependency. Then I wouldn’t be the girl with the broken brain. I would be dead, and people respect you when you’re dead. I’m going off the rails. Shockingly, it’s better than it was in the middle of the semester, when I’m pretty sure I went actually crazy. I was scared of everything, was hallucinating, and random body parts were shaking. I don’t even want to be a happy go lucky person. I just want to be able to do something productive without literally wanting to die. I can’t enjoy anything, because I don’t care about anything. I like things that are funny but I can’t appreciate life like other people can. I never have been able to. I don’t care when people die. I don’t care when tragedies happen. I only care if I’m directly involved in the situation. Even when I was a little kid I cared about almost nothing. I like aquariums though. I’d live in one if I could. Ever since I was little I’ve been convinced I’ll die at 27. That means I have nine years left. Nine years is so long but also not long enough."

my ex girlfriend abused me. she would mentally and physically abuse me. It started of with the little things, being blocked every few days over nothing. Making cry, ( I’m 23 btw ) worry about what I did, why I was such a bad person. Why I couldn’t stop making her angry and upset. Then she began making fun of my mum, and me. insinuating incest because me and my mum were close. In arguments she started, she would always say something horrible about my mum. Just to hurt me. She would walk out the room and leave for hours while she spoke on the phone to other boys. She’d talk to her friends about me and make fun of me. She would push and hit me. She would also punch me and kick me if I fell asleep. She would push me out of the bed. Push me against walls. She threw a photo I bought out her window. Ripped up everything I made her, broke a ring I made for her. And then the next day be fine. I started to self harm because of it and when she found out, she said I was attention seeking, that they weren’t proper cuts. I then tried to take my own life by jumping off a bridge. I had become resentful and angry with everyone. I was becoming someone I didn’t want to be. When she found out about this she said she couldn’t be with someone like me. There was no support. 

I’ll tell what I did for this girl though, I drove three hours every few days to see her. I bought her anything she saw and liked. I’d take her out on long drives at night. If she couldn’t sleep I would get up and make her a drink of warm milk. I took her on her first camping trip. I’d pick her up and take her to work. I always bought her presents and always got her flowers. I’d always leave notes in her bedroom. I would tidy up her room when she wasn’t at home. I would always hold her and wipe her tears when she cried. She had an incident at work that was really hard for her. And she finally decided to tell management, I sat with her in the meeting to support her. I would rub cream into her self harm cuts. I would spend all my time talking to her making sure she was safe. I pulled and all nighter as she tried to overdose so I stayed on the phone to make sure she was breathing and I didn’t have to call an ambulance. I made sure she was eating properly by always having my dinner while she ate, as well. As she lived so far away we would FaceTime on the days we weren’t together. Although she would usually hang up anyway for no reason. 

And with all that, I was still made to feel as though I was the reason that she was doing this for. So after 8 months of this I snapped. And I told her exactly what she was. I was so broken i now have ptsd. Someone playful hitting me just freaks me out. Makes me jumpy, upset. I stared drinking and i would usually end up in hospital. And I started doing drugs because to not feel was easier than living that trauma over and over agin in my head. I have abandonment issues because of how often she would block me and make me cry. If someone doesn’t message me for a day or two I panic and think they are leaving me. I hate myself. She constantly put me down, told me I looked bad told me I was too sensitive. That I was a baby. That I cry too much. She’d tell me I was boring in bed but always seemed otherwise whist we were committing the sin. Tell me I was embarrassing. Or boring to be around. 
I’m so self conscious. But I would always make sure we did something fun that day. We’d stay up until 3 in the morning playing zombies with snacks in a  bowl. We’d cook together, go on dates and picnics. Order trashy food and sit in a climbing frame at 1 in the morning. 

I have been broken down in every single way possible."

I think winter + omicron is really getting to me and the path to publishing is super brutal. You have to get a literary agent to go the traditional route and they receive 50-300 queries per week and only take on a handful of new writers each year. 

I spent years working on the book and battling depression to finish it, so it’s a major achievement for me. But now I’m faced with the possibility that it won’t be accepted and I’ll have to start on something new from scratch. To fail after all of this would be soul-crushing. The thought of writing another book and setting this one aside is also soul-crushing.

I dont want to share my problems so they dont have to worry about me. Ive been having depresing mood for the past 3 months. Ive lost 4 kg because just dont enjoy chewing food. I dont make plans with my friends anymore. I dont enjoy drawing anymore or any of my hobies like playing games which I remember I loved.

I study private game design school and feel like I dont have any future ahead of me. Its an expensive school and Its too late for me to drop out because I need to graduate. I spend my free time doing school stuff. Like modeling and texturing but it doesnt matter how much time I spend studying I just cant concentrate and end up feeling useless.

I am in school monday to thrursday from 8am to 5pm. On fridays right after school I go to work. I work at mcdonalds just because Iam young and cant work anywhere else. Altogther I work for 30 hours every weekend to help my parents pay the bills. I hate this job and at the end of the work I feel more and more empty. I could take more time from work but them my parents would have to pay more. I try to fill up my free time as much as I can so I am not left alone at home with my suicidal thoughts.

When Iam feeling too depressed I think of killing myself. The only reason why I didnt do it is because my parents have spent a lot of money on me and I dont want to disapoint them.

My parents are not to blame because I made a decision on studying this school and I want to take care of my parents when they get old.

I think I might be suffering from depression can you give me a tip what to tell my prac. doctor to get help. I dont wont to worry my parents with my problems so I just kept it to myself."

I had suicidal thoughts this morning.. I have to call the government dentist today and reschedule my appointment because I am too sick to go and it's the second reschedule so I m hoping they will be ok with it I am really frightened to call them, the anxiety is really building about it. 

Also my washing machine won't work now it has a replacement warranty so I have to call the place I bought it from today and tell them and I am hoping I don't have to fight with them about it stores are always complete assholes about honouring warranty. 

I just want to crawl into. Aball and watch TV and not function hopefully fall asleep. Two days ago during the ehatwave I started thinking about eating my own leg. It has been really weird time. Lots of psychological problems brought on by real life events and physical pains as well it's a bit much right now. 

The tinnitus in my ears won't stop ringing.

Update: I called the gov dental clinic they were mad but rescheduled my appt . I am too sick to attend today

Now I have to wait 20 more mins and call the appliance store. I just ate some Christmas cake and had vanilla cream with it it mad eme feel better but it's not on my diet and I am gaining weight

I'm so drained that I just feel like stopping. All I want to do is lay in bed and be left alone. I have two beautiful children to care for though, so that's not happening. Last week my eldest jumped off something at recess and smashed her eyebrow, which required stitches, so that was fun. My two year old will not poop normally, which means she does tiny poops ten times a day and has had so many diaper changes she now has a bleeding rash and she still won't poop. She fights me at every change and screams and cries and even though I am so gentle I can tell it hurts and I just want to cry. It breaks my heart. I've tried every thing that I can think of. The doctor said I have to get her to go normally to break this cycle and then it'll be six to twelve months before her body is back to normal and this habit of holding it is broken, so there is a long road ahead. I'm overwhelmed. 

This is my week off from pandemic teaching, but there is no relaxation of any kind. My husband refuses to get a booster and has insisted on waiting to have our five year old vaccinated which scares the crap out of me. We are waiting until may, but with omicron, my anxiety is through the roof. To make it worse, my parents are putting continuous pressure on me to figure out how to get her vaccinated. I'm all for vaccinating and that's not a debate im asking to open here. I say this because I'm in the middle of the three people I love the most and it's been that way since I got married. I can't please anyone and siding with one side upsets the other. My mother said today that if we don't get vaccinated she might have to stop seeing my family, which will just make me feel worse and increase tension. 

I hate my job. It is exhausting to have eighteen children who are supposed to be able to read and write and cant, kids who can't sit still, who need so so so much more from me and I can't give it to them because I don't have the support from higher up.

It's been a rough few years.,2,2,1640736281.0," *TLDR: Since a brain injury, my life is a shit show. Meds don't work, I had constant small seizures for six months, couldn't get help in an overloaded healthcare system, ended up in a psych ward, now at home tapering off one drug, going up on another, and popping my kid's Ritalin so I can keep up with the demands of a household and fatherhood, otherwise, I'd be useless. Can't seem to get anyone in the healthcare system to help me for at least a month. I'm putting on a brave face for my wife and kids but not sure if I can keep this up.* 

This is a long read. 

Back in 2018, I passed out on the way to the washroom and received a bad concussion (TBI). I was really into sports as a kid and, from what I remember, that was the fifth time I ""got my bell rung"" pretty badly. It took me until this summer to actually feel like I was functioning normally again. The first year was hell. I couldn't sequence things, couldn't control my emotions, couldn't have a discussion about complex topics.... and then, this year, I finally got myself back. I was ready to go back to work full-time. I was an active father to my kids, and a good husband... not a victim, or a burden anymore. 

But something else started happening during that time, which I tried to ignore. I'd started to get these twitches, or spasms (myoclonic seizures). At first, they only happened every few weeks. Then, it was every few days... then anytime I tried to relax or go to sleep, it felt like someone was standing over me zapping me with a cattle prod. I couldn't sleep at all. 

I live in Nova Scotia, and the healthcare system here isn't so good. I tried to get help twice, at emerg, because obviously, something was really wrong with me. Both times the doc said that there was nothing they could do except refer me to neurology. The wait time for that, if your brain isn't actually coming out of your skull, is over a year. 

I love my job and I was still trying to work during this period. It was difficult, but I was managing. Then, through pure bad luck, I got hit hard in the back of the head and received another concussion. Not only could I not sleep, but the pain in my head returned, the dizziness, my vision was blurry. I couldn't work after that. At first, when I wasn't in bed, I tried doing some hobbies, mainly carpentry. But then I started just doing nothing. I didn't leave the house, didn't work on anything, didn't watch tv, didn't eat. I was totally just a shell. 

Then I happened to be in the basement when no one was home and I took a box cutter and cut the shit out of my shoulder. It hurt, but it hurt good because I actually felt alive... and I had something to focus on besides the emptiness. Suicide became a bit of an obsession, but there was no good/clean way to do it without hurting my family. I thought hard about just disappearing, dying in a snowbank somewhere, but in a moment of clarity, I called the Mental Health Crisis Line in Nova Scotia. No one picked up. I waited a few more minutes, and all I got was voicemail. 

That night I told my wife that I didn't want to kill myself, but I didn't want to live anymore. I hadn't slept in forever. Nothing felt real. It felt like I was in some kind of movie. We went to emerg again, and this time I told them that if they didn't help me, I would kill myself as soon as I left. I spent that night sleeping alone on the dirty floor of an ""interview room"" using my backpack as a pillow, freezing my ass off while two security cameras blinked down on me. 

The next night, at 10pm, I was transported by ambulance to a psychiatric ward. The first week, I basically just stayed in my room, as the place was bananas. The psychiatrist met with me for a total of five minutes. During the second week, I begged a GP that was making the rounds to help get rid of the seizures I was having. I was on the max dose of Cymbalta and I thought it might be that. That doc actually listened, and then 15 minutes later, I was put on anti-epileptic meds and my Cymbalta was reduced. 

I was basically fine after that, laying on my bed, waiting to be discharged. But the psychiatrist wanted me to reduce the Cymbalta further, and increase this other drug, Lamotrigine to 100mgs. I was discharged with a plan to do this, with an appointment to see a different psychiatrist two months later. 

Unfortunately, things are not going well. I can thrive in a place (like the psychiatric ward) because I have no responsibilities, nothing I need to do, no one I have to see. Nothing is expected of me besides eating my meals and taking my pills. At home, there's a whole lot more stress dealing with real life. I don't know if it's my pills, or it's my concussion, but I'm an anxious wreck. I hate leaving the house. I don't want to speak to anyone. I tried going into a store yesterday as an exercise and was freaking out. I'm getting headaches again, feel depressed as hell, and started cutting myself again. 

One day, I accidentally took my son's extended-release Ritalin instead of my Cymbalta. I had the best day I've had in months... by a landslide. I was fucking on it. Active with the kids, contributing around the house, went grocery shopping by myself, being an all-around normal person again. I thought I had gotten over the hill. I was ecstatic, until the next day I realized what I'd done. It's pathetic, I realize, but now I'm taking my kid's Ritalin every other day, just so I can feel alive and normal again. Honestly, if any other drug were here, I would have taken it to try and get my life back. 

I know that this ride is only going to last for so long. I think often about returning to the psych ward because I can't get help anywhere else and nothing is expected of me other than getting better, but that is really hard on my family. My family doctor won't prescribe me psych meds anymore because she says she's not comfortable with it. My condition is too complex. Her hands are tied. I have an EEG for the seizures (which came back briefly) later in January and a Psychiatrist appointment towards the end of January. I want to feel better, and I don't want to commit suicide, but I can't get any fucking help. I do see a therapist, but he's overloaded too and can only see me every three weeks or so. 

I know that cutting the shit out of myself and taking my kid's Ritalin is not the answer to my problems... but since the system here is so overloaded, maybe dying is actually something to consider. It's been a rough ride. I think people would understand."

My mood is  very irregular and comes in phases but I’ve just been feeling so numb for years. For so long I felt like there is a hole in me. Like something is wrong and missing. It’s gotten worse recently and the only way I feel that I can fill it is with drugs, self harm, excessive consumption of cigarettes, or alcohol. Aside from cigarettes and self harm, i don’t do it often. Because I have never been checked out, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. This cant be normal. I was diagnosed with severe ADHD about a year and a half ago(diagnosis was late bc I’m in France and a hurlas well as an unusual school environment). Does anyone else feel this way? I feel like even for someone with adhd my motivation is extremely low, even to do things I love. And even though no body knows I feel as if I must be making this all up for the attention.

I had a breakdown again. It wanted cut myself in a way that would be painful and make me bleed a lot, but I somehow ended up going back to what happened early 2020, where I also had a breakdown and at the time cut my hair with scissors so it wasn't fully buzzed like now..

Honestly, the only reason I kept my hair was to see if my dietary changes would make it grow longer than last time (looks like it did, past 7 years on a bad diet it only grew to my ears lol..) and mostly to any potential partner, but seeing how I'll never have anyone since I'm a failure in literally every aspect of my life and have a lot of trauma and mental health issues (most to do with my environment) my psychologists don't care to help me with, then what's the point.. I already wear wigs all the time so having so much hair was just extremely bothersome.. My own hair boring and awful anyway due to genetics..

I wish I had someone to make me play games with them, voice chat, do things with that are more personal, but sigh.. Even been trying lately to set up some potential voice chats with my friends and caregiver but nothing has happened.. and just that part is already extremely difficult for me since I'm anxious about it.. The times I've had the courage to ask for a call right there and then they were busy with other things anyway so.. v_v; 

Also getting tired of all these dreams related to suicide or never growing up.. I just want to be cared for.. But not even my parents care.. 24th I was drunk and wearing my usual childish outfit but had thigh high fluffy socks on instead of fleece tights so it was extra cold to me. After the events I was in a terrible mood and really hurt and stormed off without saying much than bye and my parents who usually are so worried about me and at times force drive me home didn't care at all.. If anything they kept telling me to drive home even though they had me drink a lot of alcohol and me being under heavy influence still at the time.. So I walked home with temp being around -8.5°C hoping nobody would find me an easy target.. Got home luckily without too much fuzz, keeping my distance from some big 5+ group ahead of me, just some two guys near home noticed me and tried to catch my attention but I ignored them and walked quickly.. and since then there has been no communication between my parents other than saying no the next day when they asked if I wanted to come for food.. I could've been hurt and they wouldn't know until the next day.. But I'm their black sheep daughter anyway.. The true winner is my step dad's daughter.. She has a job, partner, money, whatever else. They had to dress up for them they said at the dinner table, not for me, some who cares about daughter..

rqsq6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rqsq6a/i_am_really_tired_really_long_post/,I am really tired (Really long post),2,0,1640733691.0,"I (M19) know not a lot of people will read this or even care about it, but I desperately need to get these thoughts out of my mind. Well, here I go:

My father and my mother divorced when I was 4 years old. They broke up because my mother cheated on him. My father raised me alone until I was 10. I still interacted with my mother because he believed regardless of what happened she was my mother and I should still see her. And never did either of them explained to me why they got divorced. My mother did not due to obvious reasons and my father because he never wanted me to resent her. I learned everything over the years from multiple people like my grandmother, aunt, uncle, etc. My father is a very caring person

he never once hit me, he never forced me to do things that I did not want, he did everything he could to raise me as a good person. When I was in first grade My father had a car accident and I stayed with My maternal Grandparents that year, my mother was not there. 

&#x200B;

After a year my father finally recovered and I went back to live with him. Throughout the years I had many babysitters due to my father being a single parent. My last babysitter was seemingly a good person. She took care of me, fed me, did everything she was supposed to do. But now I realize even though she is a good person at heart, she used me as a way for her to have a conformable life. She came from a very poor family. I don't remember much about that time, but she would always say bad things about my mother and it was very obvious she hated her. 

After a year and a half, we were about to change cities due to my father's work. When she learned about it, she would constantly say things to manipulate me: ""I can't take care of you if you move, but if I were to marry your dad I could come with you!"" or ""My father wants me back home, If I marry your dad I can live with you 24/7"". To clarify, she was like 35 and they did not have a relationship nor did my dad ever consider one. But she got the idea planted in me that I would constantly tell him that I did not want her gone, he should marry her and I loved her very much. I am aware I was an idiot child who ruined his father's life and forced him to marry a woman whom he did not love. (I should mention again that he married her due to her taking so good care of me and did not love her. And no I am not misinterpreting things because I was young and don't remember much.) 

They married when I was 10 and it was not even a wedding it was just the paper signing like a god damn contract. After that things were okay for a year or two. The difference was my dad and mom started getting together less and less. Don't get me wrong I know people who get divorced especially due to Infidelity tend to stay away from each other. However, they would not get together even for the important moments of my life. And the reason for that is due to my stepmother. Because she would constantly fight with my father for that. And eventually, he got tired of it and stopped interacting with her altogether. I still saw her a lot though.

Then my stepmother got pregnant. I love my sister and I never once hated her. But when since her birth, my stepmom started to get colder and colder towards me. To put it simply, when she got her own child, she started acting worse like a classic stepparent like in the movies. But I never told my father about it until 3 years ago because I didn't want what happened to me to happen to my sister. My father did everything he could like I said but having a broken family really leaves a hole in a person's heart. 

She treats her daughter differently than me. I get it, I really do. Because I never called her mom she doesn't treat me like a son. I always feel like a guest in my own house. When I talk to my dad she always jumps into the conversation. I can't even go out with him to talk about important things without having him argue with her. I always tried to be a good big brother. But due to my stepmom, she never respects me nor does she listen to anything I say. Whenever something important comes up, my stepmom always opposes me and forces my sister to listen to her. Due to this being the norm, my sister never listens to me now.

Due to my dad's work, we moved a lot. We changed cities 5 times when I was growing up, due to this I never made lasting friendships. I am a social person and I'm not an introvert, however, I always felt like I was putting up a mask in front of everyone, always acted confident, capable this thing continues to this very day. I had many friends, but because none of them were real I don't have a single one at the moment.

I always wanted to be a pilot and in my country, if you get a very high score in the university exam, you can go to government colleges and become one without paying, otherwise it is extremely expensive. When I was studying for the exam my stepmom would always say I could never become a pilot, I could never do it. She always did this for things I wanted and my dad always argued with her about things like this. And in the end, I couldn't do it, couldn't get the needed score. I still got into a college, but it wasn't a major I wanted. I'm in college right now and a second year. Then a pandemic happened and we had to stay at home.

I am 19 now I am trying to go to America to study there. But because of my country's economical situation, it is incredibly expensive. I am trying to get scholarships but it is hard too. I am waiting for my SAT score. Things are not looking good and I feel so trapped. I do not know what am I supposed to do and I feel extremely tired. 

I know people may think I am fortunate and I am ranting about nothing. But I left out a lot of things, otherwise, this would become a novel haha. I appreciate my dad more than anything and I know my life is not the worst. However, it does not mean it is easy. I don't have any friends, my future is looking bleak, I am in a household where everyone expects my father doesn't like me. I am not sitting there and doing anything. I am trying to do everything I can to have a better and good future where I can be proud of myself and my father can be proud of me. But I feel incredibly tired and I don't know If I can keep going on.

To whoever reads this, thank you for reading this extremely long ranting."

But for the last few months I had not felt depression in the way I was used to experiencing it. I actually wanted to fight for my life and wanted to get out of the shithole situation I'm in right now, got hyperfixated with school work and my future career and my happiness. Sadly, things just kept going downhill for me, both because of outside circumstances and because I'm an idiot, so I now find myself in a pretty terrible place with my life. The last two or three months were hell. I was fighting all the way, trying to keep my grades up, trying to improve my physical health, but failing miserably. It was hell because all I wanted was to lay down on my bed but at the same time there was this voice in my head telling me ""get up! Work! You only have this one life, and life is beautiful, please do something about this, you actually love living so much, don't just lay down"". It was hell. Because I can't do anything about it. I'm too much of a little dumbass coward to even try to do anything about it. But what my body wanted and what my mind wanted did not line up. Physically I had given up. My body was just waiting for my mind to catch up.
Today, finally, for the first time in months, that little voice has died. Its kind of stupid, when I realized that click that had happened I actually felt some sort of twisted joy. This is the depression I'm familiarised with. This is the depression that will allow me to do the bare necessary without that little voice pesterizing me constantly to change. For the sake of my sister, whom I love too much to traumatise with my death, I will not be attempting anything. But I give up on trying to have an incredible life. My main goal is to sleep as much as possible while keeping a facade of a functional human, so that I don't make my sister worry about me. I'm good with whatever shitty job, as long as I have one. If I keep up with this for long enough I'll die of natural causes soon enough (which I believe is easier to move on from than a suicide, for my sister). My body's already half dying anyways."

I’m a girl on the spectrum and I’ve been struggling with depression for most of my life. I met my boyfriend a bit over a year ago and suddenly most of my problems went away, he has helped me massively and I will be forever grateful. 

I play video games. I really look up (or used to look up) to one of the European valorant journalists - she’s a person of colour, a woman who is the main interviewer at the biggest valorant tournaments. Today she was streaming. I popped into the stream, she was struggling to win rounds and she said “what do I do as kj on attack”. I tried to help so I said “hey! You could try doing xyz, maybe that would help! Have a lovely day!”. And she read that and just started screaming at me. Telling me I’m a disgusting smelly virgin, i should go die in my parents basement. When I said that I’m sorry, I’m also a woman and I was trying to help she said that’s even worse, that I’m being toxic and I’m probably a disgusting whore. Suddenly I had 200 people in the chat echoing her and saying the same stuff to me, including members of my favourite esports team that I cheered for and looked up to so much. 

Later when I was live on twitch I had so many people come to my chat and tell me I’m so ugly and should give up and kill myself was so overwhelming. It really broke me today. 

I feel like I’m back at my worse. All my hard work on myslef is out the window. I can’t stop crying and I barely can breathe."

I just wonder why I can't commit suicide, I always think so, I have moments when I really seem one step away from death, when I feel at the foot of the abyss and then disappear and return to everyday life. I can not handle it anymore. With each fall I feel worse and worse. How can you pass from the abyss of pain, from the idea of ​​suicide absolutely unscathed and find yourself an hour later to live your usual life as if nothing had happened. I am writing now after such a moment. I have no words, I just feel very confused. Up to 10 minutes ago I was biting my arm, I would have sworn that whatever it takes I would have ended it, I would not have thought about the consequences, I would not even have written a ""letter"", I would not have justified myself in any way, I wanted that drunk with pain, suffering dragged me with it to the fatal gesture and I would not have put up any resistance. But nothing. Maybe if I weren't so afraid of death I would have really ended it many, I say many, many times. All of this makes me feel like I'm in a prison and I don't even have anything to do away with. But why do I suffer from pain like this? That there seems to be no worse evil? I don't know ... God only knows that despite all this I love life! I'll never say, never say life sucks, it's society's fault or something like that. I love life too much, but life is foreign to me, I have never been able to live. I only wanted to live following my feelings, to be interested only in what arouses me emotions. A little like how you wish at my age I dream of a life that I will never have the courage to realize. I would have liked to live writing poetry although I am incapable, I was not interested in having a long life, I dreamed of being like Jim Morrison. I would have liked to live by listening only to my feelings and striving to see the world with the inner eye that is too often clouded in this world.

 For me, going beyond the doors of perception was this, by taking care of our sensitivity we will be able to live intensely, to find new meanings in everything that surrounds us. Thus life would appear to no man too short, or too little, because ""if the doors of perception are open to man, the world would show itself as it is: infinite"" (W. Blake). Except that the road to such a life is a dark road of happiness and suffering, loneliness and fear. There is no connection between my reflections and my life. You will not find me out of the house on a rainy day, you will not see me wandering around the world, you will not see me walking in dodgy streets, in dark places, in contact with the worst of society. I limit myself to dreaming of an impossible future, I close myself in and try to fill myself with myself. Contact with society, with my peers reveals to me what I refuse to call reality (reality exists in the individual, poetry in this sense has the same reality as history, striving to live more intensely is to look more far away) but despite this leaving home for me is a devastating experience. By now I realize that every day I always repeat the same things. At school I torment myself, until only death seems to me the only way left to me. I go home, I stop thinking about suicide, as if the image of my death has already calmed me. I have moments of confusion, I rest in bed and fantasize about my life, I get depressed and then total apathy for the rest of the day. Can you understand what it means to live like this? I feel as if a glass separates me from the outside world, feeling emotions, being moved, crying and laughing but never, never being able to show anything other than my white impassive face. I look at myself and wonder how a man can go through certain torments and yet not show the slightest change outwardly. True, I probably suffer from some psychological disorder, but what should I do?  The possibility of a change terrifies me, like a tightrope walker I have created a subtle balance in real life that allows me to survive. I just feel damn stupid ... I can not help but write these ""letters"" from the prison that surrounds me, I will never have the courage I never say to tell my parents that I have to go to a psychologist. Also I live in a not very big city, I could not go anywhere secretly without making people suspect something. So why are you writing here? The support of a site will never give you the help you need .. Probably I only do it because I want to be pitied, because I want someone to tell me that I am really in pain (yeah .. After ups and downs I wonder how it is possible that I was so bad). I would like to tell you about something else, about my life, but I decide to close this ""letter"" here. Infinitely thank you for reading.

Tell me what 16 yr old girl wants a bf who looks and sounds like he’s 13, and complains about his depression despite being in such a good situation. I’m so tired of being a short, piece of shit loser that wakes up, is depressed, works out for 2 hours cause it’s the only thing that brings me joy anymore, then cries in his room with his door locked at midnight. For years my parents are the only reason I haven’t killed myself already. I know they would get over it if I did, but I ju see can’t do it. It’s not that I want to kill myself, I just don’t want to feel the way I feel anymore. I’m so tired of fucking things up. I have nobody to talk about this shit too, and if you were to publicly address your mental state people look at you like you belong in a fucking psych ward, so you just sit there and try your best to pretend like you are “fine.” I can’t keep pretending. Tried to talk about the way I feel, and was told to “man up and stop being a bitch.” I’m so fucking ugly, and so fucking skinny and it’s embarrassing to looks at myself in the mirror. Music and fitness are the only things that keep my occupied anymore, and I just can’t keep doing this. I know I’m going to break and just end it at some point, it’s just a matter of when. Lmk if anybody understands what I’m talking about. I’m so willing to be friends with anybody in this fucking subreddit. I’ve only ever told 2 people how I feel, and they screenshot the shit I said about my depression, and everybody thinks I’m fucking insane.

I've been in love with the same guy for 4 years and he rejected me 3 years ago. We continued to be good friends until he suddenly abandoned me half a year after he dropped me.

A year after he abandoned me i reached out to him and we started talking again. I feel like we still used to be good friends after i reached out to him but obviously he cared a bit less and i feel like he barely cares right now. He acts all nice and it seems like he might like me but he nearly never reaches out to me anymore.

As I'm writing this i legit just witnessed he joined the call with other friends instead of wanting me, even tho thats what our friendship used to be. Just us two, diehard best friends who wanted to call with each other all the time. He also gave me a lot of wrong signals like calling me baby all the time and being very possessive about me which doesn't make things easier.

I do have a lot of emotional moodswings and i am very sensitive / not the easiest person to take care of which i know (and hurts me to know). Two days ago we we're at a kind of party of a friend of mine and people we're drinking. I've told him i'm pretty traumatised of alcoholic people / people drinking near me but it seems like he doesn't care cuz he always drinks when were at a party of a friend of ours. I remember telling him about how much it hurt me to watch him drink at the party before that one but it seems like he didn't really care. So watching him get drunk really really broke my heart, it was hard enough to deal with the other drunk friends at that party but him being drunk aswell was just too much.

Theres more to our friendship/relationship/whatever but its so hard to pour everything out at once. Theres so many things that have happened in my life and i really really don't want to be alive anymore, i want to kill myself so badly.

Please message me if you've got any questions or want to talk about it or whatever, i don't know how to deal with this alone. I can't believe im still in love with that asshole."

rqpupg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rqpupg/attempting_to_socialize_despite_depression/,Attempting to socialize despite depression.,7,0,1640725969.0,"Hello,

I am diagnosed with mild depression by my psychiatrist and therapist. I've been taking wellbutrin for about a week, but it's too short to feel the first effects. I am quite a closed person, I don't speak much in group of people. However, despite my introverted nature, I have days when after meeting some people I feel that I have more energy. Mostly, unfortunately, after the meetings I am tired. Sometimes I am tired of the meeting at the very beginning.

New Years Eve is coming. I am going to a place where there will be a lot of people which I don't know. I only know a few people, but they don't know much about me. It is a place in the countryside, among forests and lakes, there is no big party planned. The whole meeting is socializing rather than dancing. There will be about 100 people.

And now I would like to go to the point: I feel that I do not want to go there. I am afraid that I will not find myself among these people (although I have visited the same place several times this year and as I mentioned some people know me, but some of these people probably do not even know my name). I am afraid of the moments when someone asks me what is going on / what I do in my life - I am usually reluctant to talk about myself. I think of myself as a boring person, who has nothing interesting to talk about. Generally speaking, I find my life boring. I do not know how to change my perception of this event so that my optimism about it grows by at least 10%. In addition, while taking medication, I will not be able to drink alcohol or take drugs, which will also hinder my socialization. I usually start to socialize only after drinking alcohol. Now I will not have such a booster and I am afraid that I will feel a tension among people. Ussually I feel tension all over my body, because I don't want to say anything stupid in front of people. I am also trying to be funny (which kinda puts pression on me to be funny). I do not have social phobias and I am not afraid to talk to different people individually. But usually during the conversation my brain gives me the energy ""I'm boring and I'm boring the other person, I'd better move away"". I really don't know how to handle it.

I don't want to close myself to the world, I want to go out to people, I want to meet new people. But at the same time ... it is uncomfortable for me to be around people, despite the fact that many times I have been to events where there were a lot of strangers.

I will appreciate any tips and comments."

Also, people say to ""leave depressed people alone."" And while I agree that ""just be happy"" is ignorant and stupid advice. In my experience (most of the last decade has been sad, lonely and hopeless), you do have to decide to be happy. Like, your brain is smart enough to trick you into feeling worthless and sad and hopeless. It's strong enough to go the other way. At some point you have to take that mental step to do something, not necessarily even go to therapy or take meds, but to make an effort to have something to build on. Or to find 1 small thing to motivate you to make things better or view what you have in a better way.

I'm having a hard time because my only good friend is fully pushing me away and honestly, he was my motivation. He made me laugh and think a bit more highly of myself and have a tiny hope for the future. He is lucky in ways that I would kill to be... just the beauty in the mediocracy of an average life is out of my reach (loving parent, friends, decent job, housing, car, relationship).  I want him to see that he can be happy, he has been happy. I don't want to overwhelm him but I know depression doesn't just disappear out of nowhere and I don't know how much I should push. Maybe I'm just weird but my logical brain doesn't disappear when I'm sad and most people it's not like that? lol"

I have been on multiple SSRIs for the past 20 years as well as anti-anxiety meds Xanax on and off for about 15 years.  I have been off the benzo for over 2 years.  The trend seems to be the SSRI's quit working after a few years.  I decided to get genetic testing and my body doesn't metabolize SSRI's very well.   We added L-methyl folate it did help for a small time. I am currently on 20mg of Lexapro. I struggle with social anxiety, major depression, and ADHD. My moods are up and down, I also have SLE Lupus so my health problems sometimes become my depression. I have really struggled with going outside after this pandemic, being immune-compromised has made it very hard to continue a ""normal"" life. My Dr and I decide its time to switch meds.  She is putting me on Pristiq, I start tomorrow and I am nervous. Would love any feedback on this drug and people's experiences.  I know everyone is different, I do not know anything about this drug nor the class it is in. Thanks!"

I'm struggling with a lot of problems about my life. My social skills, my physical appearance, my studies, stress, etc. I'm scared of what people are gonna say if I go back to therapy; I started going when I was like 14 y/o and stopped my treatment at 17 (I'm 22 now) but I've been feeling like shit for years. I try to hide my feelings from my family because I don't want them to worry about me or making them mad because ""I'm not happy with anything"". 

Since that fight, there are times at the day that I just start crying just asking ""why did I do that?"" and not wanting to live anymore. I want to apologize to them but I think that won't be enough. This just pushes up my thoughts on hating myself (which is something I say in my mind everyday at almost every minute). I don't know what to do.

What jobs allow you to set your own hours?,1,0,1640721291.0,"I've had diagnoses of MDD, Anxiety, and PTSD since I was in middle school but I've been told I was even a depressed kid. I go through phases of being okay and then not okay, and it's gotten a lot better the deeper into my 20s I've gotten, but it's still a struggle and I have a major breakdown every 2 years and minor ones a few times a year.

I know my mental health issues play a HUGE part in my urge to quit my job every 2 months or so. My current job is great and I don't have the urge as much, but it's been happening more often lately. I can easily deal with this even if it's annoying, but my depression and anxiety has affected my jobs in other ways too. Yesterday I couldn't sleep until 7AM and ended up waking up at 3PM and basically fucked up my whole work day. I had to lie to my job about why I didn't show up and I had a terrible day and so much anxiety about it.

I've been in this situation so many times. When I first started getting full time jobs after college, my biggest worry was waking up on time because I've always had insomnia (which I know is linked to my depression). For the most part, I've been able to balance my mental health and my jobs, but it's so goddamn hard. I've been at my current job for almost 2 years and it's the longest one I've held and haven't quit. My mental health has 100% affected my career and my other jobs.

I'm at a place now where I've accepted that it will always be a struggle and I think my best bet is working for myself. I've considered buying/selling online or starting my own company (which would be so hard and I don't even know where to start), because I need to set my own hours. Does anyone work for themselves or have a job setting their own hours? Any advice on getting past those feelings of not wanting to work or being overwhelmed about life/work in general? I practice mindfulness but sometimes my symptoms are so heavy I can't get through them.

I'm a great worker and always do a wonderful job in any position I've held, so I HATE that my mental health interferes with my progress."

it's either that i'm too guarded or when someone sees who i really am outside of being an acquaintance or can't cope with my extreme depression lows (that seems to cycle every 4-5 years), they leave. 

they tell me: get help, do better. 

but what else can i do? i'm on medications, i'm in psych/therapy. i do my coping mechanisms (walks, art, take care of plants, journal, try to socialize regularly), i keep up with my meds & treatment. 

but i'm not ""compatible"" or ""stable"" enough to have long lasting friendships or relationships. i keep my therapy sessions with my therapist & not use my few friends to emotional dump. i let them know when i'm not well, but otherwise keep the really heavy thoughts to myself or therapist.

Seems like every time I reach a high point, I'm reminded that I'm still not where I want to be career-wise and living-wise, and it brings me back down hard. Even if I'm finally working somewhere that makes me feel happy for longer than a few hours at a time and made a friend who I absolutely adore, I'm still not even close to the career I've wanted to get into. Did more planning than action and now I'm a 26-year-old woman still living in her shoddy, expensive as hell hometown, still stuck for nearly 7 years after having to move back home because she couldn't afford her college tuition. What do I have to show for it? An associate's degree in education, a variety of spreadsheets on how much it would cost for me to go back to school or move elsewhere, schedules on how I could sustain myself and my sanity on a second income, etc., and a drinking problem.

I'll pick something up once in a while--start watching a new anime or tv series, try to find a new movie to watch, play some video games for a few hours, take out my sketchbook to do a sketch, finish up a book I've set aside, consistently work out, but it all feels so empty. People keep telling me it's what I make of it, life is ""about the experience"", and I technically could do anything (like switch careers or move states), but I think about the risks involved; the fact that I need to finish my degree before I move on, the fear of not having connections moving somewhere new, the fear of not having enough money to sustain myself and having to move back home anyway, and the fact that I still feel like everything is worthless. Plus most of the people telling me ""just do it"" are either mostly content with their life, never moved away, risk-takers, extroverted, or have the money and means. What stopped me from moving years prior was that I at least had my dogs, but both passed away in 2018-2019, after 15 years and now staying home doesn't mean much except a roof over my head and a place to rest. 

I have zero motivation to do anything. Been on vacation for 12 days so far and have about 6 days until I go back to work, with nothing to show for it. Have only gone out to see two friends, but other than that I've mostly been home taking care of my mom, running errands, and cleaning. I plan on going back to taking college courses in the second half of spring if I can even afford it. I don't want to go back to work (pre-k teacher), don't want to go back to school, and haven't done much since I've been home. I set up my easel ten days ago to make a few paintings for friends as Christmas gifts. The canvas is still blank and unprimed, and my desk still a mess. My garden is thriving and the rest of my house is clean, but that's as ""good"" as it has been for me.

On my good days and free days, I think of balancing work with part-time school again since I used to be able to manage without falling behind in school or having it affect my work. Some days I even think of getting a second job for extra income since teaching in my area pays enough for you to survive paycheck to paycheck. Then when I go back to work, I realize it isn't feasible with the amount of effort I put into my job and how long I sometimes stay to prepare for the rest of the week. On my good days, I also will go back to dating apps, make new friends, have conversations, but nothing clicks or lasts for long. It all goes back to feeling empty.

I feel like I'm wasting my 20's away. I turn 27 in February and I'm dreading it. Feel like I don't have anything to show for it, and it gets worse when my inner critic reminds me that I had such high hopes and dreams that I had been working towards, but I had no money and overprotective parents. My parents are less overbearing now, but I still don't have a lot of money because I impulsively overspend and drink heavily to fill the void when I could be saving the money to buy the new car I had been saving for or the plane ticket out of my state.

tl//dr: My life feels meaningless, I feel like a failure, and I'm having a hard time working myself out of the place I am now. Pretty much sums it up. I've been battling with depression since I was 10, but it seems like it just got more intense and boring."

no need for anyone to read that

I got a lot of problems and sucidal thoughts are nothing new but i knew seriosly considerd it because I need to protect my bf and best friend.

But sometimes I have this times where my head just doesnt seem to be there. I justr got my self in live threatining situations purposfully. Not carring or thinking.

And sometimes my thoughts just go wild and are incredibky overwhelming. There are so many thoughts at the same time. It feels so incredibly painfull(?). Its just pure torture.

It starts slowly is getting louder and louder. Until i cant move I cant even sh. I just lay shivering and silently screaming and cant move I shiver and sometimes I freeze. After a cetrain time. It can happen that I stand up, doing generic thing like going downstairs eating or plucking my eyebrows. I can respond. It just feels like Im remote control and I can still feel the incredibke pain, but ca't comprehend it anymore. So I just continue what I was doing. Im unable to call help or even show what is happening.

And both things: Mindless sucidal thoughts and sh and those moments of incredible pain are getting more frequent. And I just can barrely keep myself from seriosly injuring or killing myself. Its not the usual weight on my throat getting heavier. Its more sudden and Im scarred.

I just wished I could get help. My mother just keeps screaming at me everytime I just mention a psychiatrist and threatens me with dening me my ADD treatment or the diagnosis where I'm in atm (for autism). I wish I could just hate my mother but I love her and she's just sometimes like that. I just don't trust her. Shes unpredictable. She goes from the nicest person to a monster in seconds and without reason.

When she discovert my sh (twice). She just started pressuring me for answers and treatens me with sending me away and goes over to giving me all the faukt for literary everything a day later. She allways believs me I stopped. Once I went away because I just couldn't anymore. She called me and told me to kill myself. She constantly screams at me for literary no reason.

I understand her beeing upsed with me beeing unable to cleen my room and getting up. I understand that she cant breathe. But I just cant and I dobt know why. But she also dosent understand how stressing the idea is that someone goes into my room. I couldnt even comfortably leave my bf into my room the first 2 years f our realtionship. I just hate it.

Honestly the thought of her going into my room is one of the reasons I never seeked help. Im in fear I had to stay at a clinic and my mother cleans up my room."

As title says, SO has been diagnosed with severe depression with paranoid thoughts.

He started 50mg setraline over 3 weeks ago. Up to now, he still hates me, thinks I’ve done it, he isn’t thinking rationally what’s ever. Just to add to the mix, I’m 7 months pregnant. He has had a bad upbringing with a bullying toxic dad so I think he also has worries about becoming a dad for the first time. It’s so hard because he won’t go anywhere near me, wants to end the relationship because he thinks i’ve cheated….. anyone been through similar? I feel like I’m living a nightmare, not sure if he will ever believe me at this point. I went to parents over xmas for a few days which he said was the best he’s felt mentally when I’m not around which hurts. Also he doesn’t love me anymore, it’s all so hurtful and worrying.

She was my world, was with her 11 years, I trusted her to the extent that what she said might as well be one of the laws of physics and there for unquestioned because it just is.

So when she told me she loved me and would always be there for me, no matter what, after I opened up to her about my depression and wanting to get help for it (she had a lot going on, all her time was going into a job where she had a lot of responsibility and was also going to school, so I really didn't want to add to the stress, which is why I didn't open up sooner), her leaving me a week later shook the foundation of my reality.

Even still as she was leaving me, I tried to stay strong for her, helped her pack her things, struggled with not calling or texting her (failed to not call or text a few times), she acted like it was nothing in some ways, like it was just another day, a liberating day at that (she also quit school pretty much at the same time), told me she liked the city we lived in but was excited to learn the new City she was moving to, told me about the new place she was living, said she still wanted to be friends and go hang out, acted like I was odd for hurting.

Meanwhile I couldn't sleep, every time I slept, I would wake up from or to a nightmare, either from a dream where we got back together and would wake to my new reality, or in a nightmare were I was going through losing her in different ways. 

Needless to say 1 1/2 to 2 hours was the max sleep I was getting per a night, I was cracking in ways I didn't know possible. It didn't help that she still had her pet rats with me (new roomate/her coworker didn't want pet rats) and I had to see her when she came to clean up after them while trying to figure out what to do with them. Which on one of those occasions she actually said something about how I should have seen it coming because of how good I was at predicting what was coming next in shows.

Yeah she was no longer the person I knew, the women she worked with some how completely changed the loving, compassionate, thoughtful person I loved in to someone that was unrecognizable in many new ways (more to the coworker story but would add to much, to sum it up though, coworker was a side piece to the business owner, but wasn't happy with her place in life knowing he had a wife and kids at home, found out later she said all types of things, basically sabotaged other people's relationships while offering them a place to live so she would be less lonely).

Anyways, a month of not sleeping and feeling the way I was, I ended up doing coke for the first time (one night, and never again since), and for the first time in a month, some how the pain lessened a little. In my tired and high state I stupidly texted her how I finally wasn't hurting as much (and why I wasn't hurting as much, which I'm sure if she ever does think back on this, she uses it to help paint me in a different light), she told me she never wanted to talk to me again (conveniently trying to leave the rats to me, I already had our dog and had no desire for pet rats), so the only other contact I had with her after that was asking her to get the rest of her stuff along with her mail and also told her if she paid me what she owed me I would find the rats a new home. 

She sent me a message back saying throw it away and that was pretty much it. I threatened to leave the rats in a cage in front of her work, she messaged back with a lie saying she moved to her parents in another state, I called her bluff and went to her work and could hear her there, told her and her coworker, last chance to pay me or I leave the rats here. Her coworker came out to try to talk me out of leaving them, then she finally came out to do the same, but still not willing to pay me for money that she agreed was mine early on in the breakup but she needed to borrow it to pay for a few things.

I left the rats there and we haven't had contact since.

Years later at times I still feel great pain and miss the person I used to know, not the girl she turned in too, but the women I loved, and yes I've tried therapy and psychiatrist (meds), I've had 3 different therapist in the time since. Didn't really help me much.

I'm not really interested in a new relationship, for many reasons really, the desire to be close to someone (no I don't mean physically, although as a byproduct it would be welcome) is still there, but I just don't feel available to it in many ways. Plus my depression (highs and lows) kind of makes it hard for me to click with people.

I just love and want the person who no longer exists, and I know that mentally, but it doesn't matter emotionally, and I don't know if it ever will. When we were together and all her free time wasn't being taken, I truly thought I was with the person I would always be with, a sense of belonging, and I truly believe that she felt the same way before she got wrapped up with the crazy demand her job while trying to also continue with school. 

The soul crushing feeling I get when I'm not keeping myself distracted is hard to deal with, I don't really know if I want to die, but I also don't really want to exist, I keep going because it's what my parents need, I wouldn't want to be selfish and leave them with even a tiny bit of what I feel, plus they can really use the financial help that I bring to them, but it's hard, it feels like a never-ending sacrifice, I really don't want anything to ever happened to them, but if circumstances were different and I didn't have them in my life, I really don't know if I could keep this going, even now work life becomes shaky from time to time because it becomes too much.

Not being selfish is becoming increasingly harder as time goes on, not easier."

This is my story and I don't know well how this app works and if somebody will actually read this but that's ok, I did my part. 
I was a good daughter and I'm loved by my parents.
I was a decent sister and I'm admired by my brother(idkw).
I was an excellent student and I'm still remembered by my teachers.
I was the best friend you could have and I'm still in contact with a lot of great people who care for me.
I wasn't very confident but I liked myself.
I was fine then I was not.
It happened six years ago, at one point I couldn't sleep at night, I had so much anxiety I couldn't eat properly and I started to have bad thoughts. I don't understand, I didn't suffer big trauma, nobody hurt me, I was doing good, Nietzsche would say that I had an ""ocean of possibilities"" but still I felt ill and I was confused at first, then scared, than sad, then numb and now I'm empty. I don't feel, I wake up, I look around me and It's like I'm watching from another point of view. Sometimes they resurface, the feelings, but they're bad, mostly I feel ashamed of myself, tired, hopeless and angry. 
It's like I'm not even entitled to talk about Her (Depression), out there I know people have been abused, beaten, abandoned,etc...and they rightfully deserve help, attention but I'm a privileged white girl  who just doesn't know how to live and doesn't understand how everything went south, I don't deserve anything, probably hate from all of you, You have a reason to feel the way you feel but I don't find mine, I'm actually useless, worthless, I don't have anything to offer to the world. 
Sometimes I'm lonely, you know I had this cute boyfriend, he was sweet but never even noticed I was sick, how could he say he loved me when I was thinking about self harm every day, how could he say he loved me when he knew about my scars, my ugly relationship with food and other thousand problems without trying to help me. Ok, he was twenty too, I'm not saying he should have cured me or something  but fuck just tell me that I should get help, tell me I should go to a therapist, don't fucking say ""It's gonna be ok"", just help me realize it's not normal shutting down for days, thinking that I deserved to be punished because I was feeling bad. 
I realized I had Her two years ago, I was talking with this friend and she asked me how I was feeling and in a moment of bravery I told her the truth, I told her I didn't feel a lot, that everything was gray and she said joking ""Damn, It's like Depression"" and I was like ""....yes,like depression..."" I don't even know how much I cried that night. Well, I realized something was off years prior but you know, admitting to yourself you have Her it's hard because you're admitting to your pride that you need actual help, that you can't do this alone. 
Friends and family don't know anything at all, It's just they wouldn't get it, I've always been a high sensitive person and even before I couldn't talk about some thoughts with them, yes, you could say ""You should make new friends"" and I agree but I should hang out, expose myself and I don't feel worthy. 
I'm failing university, I spent so many days in bed thinking about the worst things of myself that I cannot seem to see my future anymore, I don't know what I'm doing with my life, I'm a comet and I'm going to burn against the atmosphere of the world and at this point I don't even know if I want to stop.
 I have two months to try and find a new way to live with myself, to try to be happy again, to try to feel everything this Universe has to offer but I don't know If I'm strong enough to do it.
I don't want to die, It's just that sometimes I want peace. Peace can be found in a lot of ways, one is starting to accept myself but it's difficult, I think I'm gonna try, I'm gonna give myself this chance and at the end I'm gonna tell you, stranger, what is gonna be of me.
Even if I don't know you, in the purest and sweetest way, I love you, 
Dalia"

I still want to never have existed in the first place but instead of having a storm inside my head constantly try to push me to end it all, I have nothing now, literally emptiness. The days feel like I have become a husk or more like a mindless robot. I'm not living life, I only exist. Sure, they are times where things can be enjoyable but after a moment, I feel confused. I have great friends and a nice family but even with those I can’t shake that weird thing/feeling that I cannot describe that well inside of me. A kind of void or emptiness, I guess.

I have no more passions or interest in things that I used to like. My self esteem always has been shit but I learned to act like i didn't care to get through some situations. I have never been in a relationship because I am just unable to love and even if I was able to love, I wouldn't want to burden someone else with being with me. I am pretty boring, unable to hold a conversation without making it look like I don't care. There is no future for me and I have no way to certainly obliterate myself so I guess i have to continue living for my friend and family.

Coming out of lockdown in the UK/Scotland in March should have been the best thing to happen to me since the beginning of 2020, but it was actually the start of this horrible cycle that I am in. 

The first night back out i met a girl who changed me in so many ways, I became a new person with her and fell in love with her very quickly. After some time with her i realised that she was not the person that I thought she was at the start. She was a seriously depressed and troubled individual with a lot of baggage and trauma from past and poor relationships before me. I let her fuck me around solely because i believed it wasn’t her and that it was her depression.

I have always struggled with my own mental health but never actually realised it until i met her and could relate to the way she was feeling and the things she explained about her thoughts. 

The thing i cant understand is why she done the things to me that she done with other guys and with very petty lies about things that genuinely don’t make sense. 

I am in the worst place Ive ever been since i finally built up the courage to leave her for good, but i am not getting any better. 

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but i am just genuinely looking for a bit of outside advice.

Everyone knows I am a burden for them, and my girlfriend thinks this as well. I have no unique abilities and I'm just a human scum. ""bUt No yOu hAvE mAnY gOoD qUalItIeS"" I DON'T.
She is perfect and does a lot of things for me. She's Unique, funny, caring. She is not literally perfect, but realistically who human is?. Then there's me, a depressed dumbass that can't do anything basically. I know that she has basically given up. I just can't wait for her to leave me and I'll just let myself accept that I am useless and that I can finally leave this place. I don't want to have a reason to live anymore because I want to die, but the little reasons to keep going on are there. But I just can't wait to lose all hope and just let myself go once and for all."
