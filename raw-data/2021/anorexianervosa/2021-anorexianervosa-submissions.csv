Last winter I has my first experiences with anorexia and I managed to fight it off in about April, or at least I thought. I got to the holiday and immediately shit hit the fan. Calorie counting started again, I've become obsessive over checking my weight and appearance every day, and I've been doing a lot of unintentional fasting. I'm starting to get scared and frustrated because all I've eaten in the past 36 hours is an egg and a small pack of crackers because my mind is refusing to intake food. I thought I'd made so much progress, but now everything has hit reverse and I'm back to square one."

2 weeks ago i was doing okay. eating alot more feeling
ok about it & maintaining. although i had no plan too
continue this i was accepting how i currently behaved
and my mindset for the moment

christmas was crap lol got abit worse & urge too restrict was massive. ive not been alone at all for about a week now & staying at my friends and i feel so overwhelmed. staying at my friends has allowed me too restrict alot for the first time in 3 weeks or a month maybe and i feel like its just chucked me back into the deep end. i ate some toast this morning and havent felt that uncomfortable about eating food in ages. like 2 weeks ago that probs would have been ok but now its too stressful and since im not home and cant weigh food etc im using more behaviours too compensate. 

halve way thru eating i realised there was some mould on the bread, and my first thought was at least this could get me sick and i could loose weight. mate what. its crazy how easy these thoughts can slip back in after even accidentally restricting or when you don't even realise you've been slipping back. not sure where i stand with my ed at all anymore or if i have one rn. i guess it never rly goes away, i just want help so i can feel validated but dont actually want too get better :( 

idk, ty for reading, sending luv <3"

Of course I had to interpret it as her calling my feet fat and even if my feet were fat it wouldn't matter I should have just laughed because she didn't mean that at all

but I had to get really sad and upset right there and even though I didn't tell her something was wrong the mood went cold and she left a few minutes later in a rush

and my friend and me were on a walk together and she started complaining about how hard being skinny is and how people constantly think she is anorexic i understand that might be annoying but she was talking about people who suffer from anorexia in such a negative way saying ignorant things so i decided never to open up to her about how i am trying to recover right now

I don't think anyone will even read this but if I hope everyone on this subreddit can heal and have a great new year best wishes to everyone"

I’m trying to eat the right amount of calories to keep my body nourished these days but it feels impossible to eat anything more.

I went to stay with my friends after one >!had to rip my gun out of my hand!< to stop me from unaliving myself. Everything happened really quickly after, like everything in my life changed over night. They have all sorts of things I’ve wanted and wouldn’t let myself buy, as well as tons of deserts from the holiday. At first I was really cautious about it, then it felt like I’d been given a golden ticket to eat whatever I want. That feeling crashed when I inevitably started to gain weight. Now I get hungry again from eating so much more normally than before and struggle much harder not to eat certain things…. So I’ve fallen into a cycle of B/P, sort of. My brain considers eating anything that I wish I didn’t to be a binge, so we are talking about normal portions of these things. I hope that makes sense? 

This leads me to last night. My friend saw me take a small slice of banana bread and was asking if I'd ever had it fried, and I said I'd never even had banana bread before now. My friends are very keen on pressuring me to eat, so he went to fry us both a piece. I'm a passive people pleaser, but I did say like ""that's *so much* butter."" He said to trust him. Butter is one of the things my brain gets the most mad about, if not the top of the list. I'd have never eaten that in a million years. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely delicious. It was really hard to eat even with all of the peer pressure, and my brain tried really hard to keep me from swallowing it so I had to try several times and basically yo-yo it. 

My friends don't let me go to the bathroom right after I eat, which is fair but I hate it anyway. I had needed to go buy more monster so I went to do that, and I slipped a gallon ziplock bag into my pocket. A ziplock bag is not a very wide opening, so despite being careful I still got it all over my lap. I then had to decide what would be more embarrassing... walking into my friends house in just a T-shirt and dance shorts (because that's what was under my hoodie and jeans, and it was cold) and having to come up with a reason I'd remove layers when it's like 1°c outside, or walking into the petrol station covered in yeet and washing my things off in the bathroom sink there. I chose the latter.

I don't think I've ever been as ashamed as I felt while I was driving home at 9pm in wet clothes and shivering violently. That was my fault entirely and a new low for me."

Now that it's out in the open and I don't have to hide the fact that I'm constantly trying to cut calories or restrict my eating or whatever I just do it all the time now and I can't not.

How do I break this cycle after constantly calculating everything that goes into my body after I've spent literally years doing this out of necessity? I did what I had to do to get my weight down for a surgery and I'm really proud of the progress that I made but I've hit a healthy weight but now I can't stop.

I've lived so much with my life with ""number go down = good"" as basically my motivating factor that I don't know how to live without that. Now that people around me know it's happening I feel like I don't have to hide it or pretend anymore oh, I can just engage in the harmful behavior and people will know what's going on with no awkward questions. It's stupid but it's how it is.... 

How do you break the cycle?"

When I started to lean into anorexic tendencies obviously I used running to burn calories and turned exercise into something not healthy but I still loved running. Now that I've been in forced quasi recovery for about a year, I haven't been officially allowed to run. This summer I was running a lot on my own with my parents knowledge but not the doctors, and I had really high hopes of returning to school and returning to my sport on a team. That did not happen and instead I got admitted to the hospital again. It's been about two months since the last time I ran as of today. I'm allowed very little exercise, barely even allowed to walk around my neighborhood despite my vitals looking healthy and everything being somewhat okay. I am still underweight but I have been for the majority of my life, pre and ""post"" anorexia. I'm not in school right now and I'm really struggling with the workload because I am online while my school is in person and they aren't being very accomodating. I lost my job because I can't go into work and while it's not that serious because I don't need a job, I was very happy when I got it and looking forward to making my own money. I have a lot of anxiety and stress and a whole bunch of other feelings about my situation and I just don't see it getting better. It's so pathetic, I don't want my life to be like this anymore but I also don't want to recover traditionally. I am already eating pretty regular and decent portions while maintaining weight I don't understand why that can't be enough. Exercise is the main thing frustrating me in this moment. I miss running so so much. 

TL;DR: I'm in a bad place and could use some words of encouragement or just anything from personal experience that could help me maybe get through this. Not to sound too desperate or crazy but it feels like there's no point anymore and I just cant live like this anymore. 

also I have covid right now so I'm quarantined in my room, making the no movement thing worse. can't even walk around the house like I normally do so I just feel so sedentary and frustrated."

This makes me so angry...,22,7,1640791982.0,"My weight is so low already. I don't have a scale at my place otherwise I have the urge to weight myself all the time and I obsess over it. When I go to my boyfriend's place, he knows he has to hide his scale otherwise I'll be driven to it like some kind of light-obsessed moth. But because of the holidays, I spent some time at my grandmother' place and I was able to weight myself.

This is so weird, because I feel like my body is gross and enormous. I don't find fat people gross, it makes me so angry whenever my best friend's mom call her ugly because of her fat. I only have that kind of hatred towards myself.

I was sure I had gained, I have urges of depreciating myself and sometimes I say it out loud. My boyfriend told me that he actually found me thinner and that I had to watch out. The thing is... he's so thin himself. His body is what I wish I had. He doesn't have any eating disorders, he's just naturally so thin, so it's easy for him to say.

The scale says he's right, but it's doesn't make any sense to me. This is not how I feel nor what I see. It's like I was looking at a reflection of myself from a parallel dimension that no one can see except from me, yet I'm the one who has to live with this reflection since I cannot see anything else.

So I've been trying to rationalize it. ""It's only the eating disorder lense"". And now, this adds show up on Reddit... Fuck. I don't even look up for anything related to diets on internet, I never did any diet but ""stop eating point blank""... I don't know why I'm so sensitive about it. It's like, I'm slowly accepting that what I see is a distortion, and here this Reddit add is catching up and saying ""No, that's actually true"".

I don't know where I'm going with that post. I think I just needed to vent. I don't have anyone to talk about this, my best friend struggles with her own body image and I could never tell her about this, it would make her insecure. She would probably feel the way I feel with my boyfriend..."

I Never used to Enjoy eating with my Family due to the Toxic environment, but i often miss it because even the little things, the small good times we'd have and the fun at homemade birthday dinners or christmas dinner, the laughs, the conversation, hearing my parents and siblings share their memories with us, I miss it so much.

I wish i could eat a full meal without needing to know every calorie, without limiting myself so much. I miss being able to look at myself in the mirror and feel proud, even when im at bare bones all i think is ""LOWER LOWER LOWER"" or ""FAT FAT FAT"" its Infuriating.

So it's not like i'm NEVER going to check the scale again, but i also know that checking it constantly or too much is also not normal and unhealthy. 

So.. how often should i check the scale to the point where it's not obsessive, but also normal to check up on how i'm doing and making sure i'm staying healthy?"

i really need some advice since i am completely lost atm.   
For some information, i was kind of in a healthy body and mindset the last few years.   
I worked out and ate healty, feeling kind of good.   
But two years ago i got into a depressive episode, the COVID situation, lockdowns, stress at work, etc. made it really worse. Maybe these were even the trigger points. So i gained a lot of weight because i couldn't work out anymore, nor did i have the energy to cook properly.   
After i gained a lot of weight, i had to deal with really harsh comments from all sides. At work people pointed out that i looked worse then ever before, that i should really watch out being that unhealthy.  
My whole family started going at me, commenting on my body changes, that i need to stop eating.  
Worst of all my boyfriend kind of jokes about my weightgain all the time. He even compliments me when i'm skipping lunch or dinner. Says how attractive he finds other peoples bodies while he looked me in the eyes and told me how much weight i gained. This all made me go down a more depressive spiral. 

The last few weeks have been hard. I lost a lot of weight because i can barely eat. Everytime someone offers me food i just hear all the bad comments, my belly aches and i just feel overwhelmingly bad for even having a thought of eating it. I feel like i would disapoint my family and boyfriend. I talked with my therapist about it, but he didn't really take it seriously and said that i have enough problems at the moment who need to be fixed. And that an eating disorder commonly occurs only among women. I can't change my therapist right now, since others are fully occupied. 

I just feel exhausted, i have no energy most of the time. I was such an open, selfconfident, active person. Nothing of this is left. I changed and i don't know what to do. 

If you have some advice for me, that would be amazing.  
If not, venting is sometimes good as well..."

I made the mistake of telling him I still masturbate, even though we’re not having sex, and he is MAD!!  Sex drive has very little to do with masturbating for me. I’m not horny, not in the mood, not really enjoying it, just getting off as fast as possible for the pick-me-up. 
Now, when he sees me eating ‘too much’ he comments because her knows how I feel about my body and he can’t just sit there and watch me make things worse’— worse for him, because he’s not getting laid.  On top of how I feel about myself, our relationship is trash and I resent him. He’s not getting laid anyways.

 my family & i have gone away for xmas & are staying in an apartment. for the weeks leading up too xmas i started too come out of a deep place in my ed & sort of made my peace with not wanting too restrict/ engage in ed behaviours as much and things got a little better.

took sf w me, although when i was home i didn't rly eat them and felt comfortable being more adventurous with my food & eating. but now im away its like i panicked and started engaging in ed behaviours and thoughts of restriction r much stronger. maybe because it feels unfamiliar or i feel too out of control. 

i cant rly eat vegan when im here just vegetarian because its way too complicated for my family too cater too- which i get and am ok w doing. my family made random comments about my eating habits or my previous ones ( like oh remember when u used too weigh ur food etc) which i trued too shift topic v quickly cause they have no clue ab my struggles.
 my brother hardly eats (not ed related but idk) & my mum expressed her concern. it all just makes me sad and mad and want too restrict even more & now im sat here when everyone's eating breakfast on boxing day and cant even eat/ join in.

i just found christmas much much harder than i thought it would. which makes me kinda sad. part of me is happy that i want too restrict more again but idk. this whole thing is just messed up. i dont like christmas anymore. 
i just dont know what too feel anymore and i feel guilty over eating when others diddnt and eating more than others. they all hardly ate which makes things so much harder.

Any time I think about purposefully losing weight, everyone suggests “it’s as simple as calories in, calories out” or directs me to intermittent fasting. If I try them, it’s a fast track to relapse. Most people don’t know about my issues though, so I can’t tell them why that advice won’t work. 

It also just frustrates me and makes me sad because I feel like I’m locked out of a weight loss technique. Am I just doomed to never safely lose weight again? Or maybe I need to let go of intentional weight loss. It feels impossible to let go when my brain is wired for that goal."

I'm a 26M, I first got sick with anorexia when I was 20, it lasted about a year. I've had a few minor slips here and there these past years.

About two months ago, I started counting calories again and restricting the food I eat. The thing is, it's not nearly as bad as it was when I was 20. Back then, I had a calorie limit and if I passed, it would nearly destroy me. I would never eat outside, I'd do a lot of exercise, etc.

Now, even though not eating is very much always in my mind and I still avoid going out to eat. It's not as scary. If I pass the limit I do feel bad, but it doesn't destroy me.

But every day I wake up hoping I don't go over my limit and yet, I hope I do. I was miserable back then. I don't want to go back, but I do. ¿?

It's confusing.

Anyway, I've been thinking of this as a relapse, but now I'm not even sure.

This is a long shot, I'm not asking of medical advice, just maybe an opinion?

Great. Whats more of a problem? The bingeing or the restricting/compulsing? Because i have been letting go of the restricion and what happened? Nothing. I never feel satisfied still and i keep waiting to wake up one morning - suddenly obese, and i know its completely irrational.

My best coping skill is telling myself it’s extreme hunger. Its not 😅. I am nowhere hungry, just deperate for tasty stuff.

I feel silly. 

I am dreading working out so much, working out fasted does not work for me at all and I’m mad at myself for that. Im mad at myself for being so bad at fasting now. Back before i worked out i could just fast without issue but i cant anymore. I wanna eat breakfast but i can’t - i’ll just feel unbelievably guilty because I told myself i WOULDN’T and what would doing it say about my willpower? I shouldn’t eat it if I’m not allowed to. 

I feel like such a fake because i eat regularly, despite my intake being pretty low, despite all my physical symptoms and the fact that obsessive thoughts about food/exercise/my weight control literally my whole life - not being able to prove myself through fasting anymore makes me feel like I’m not sick at all. I cant even say that i have an ED without feeling like such a liar. 

I just wish i could be normal :)) but Im stuck in the cycle of “I’m not even sick i don’t need help and even if i was and did need / get help id gain weight and I’m not at a weight low enough for that to be okay” its so frustrating.

Just looking for some external validation or something idk. This holiday sucks, i hope you guys are okay <3"

So a while ago i had this friend, she went vegan due to guilt and sympathy towards the animals, may i add i am completely respectful and tolerant towards other people's diets, i dont care if people go vegan aslong as they share a mutual respect for my diet as i do for theirs. I was once eating a Hotdog, as meat was a food i was advised to eat by my doctors and i felt comfortable eating meat. I was shamed and labelled an animal ab*ser and r*pist for eating my safe foods, and as i have OCD these words stuck with me and became a mild theme of mine, i now avoid animal products at all costs due to fear of being an animal r*pist, since i dont usually eat often due to my Eating disorder, and my Doctor advised against me attempting diets like Veganism, Vegetarianism, Etc, and i essentially live off 2 Cans of Fanta a day. 

I have Developed an Iron Deficiency due to me not eating meat as it was my only source of iron and protein, I am completely aware of the issues within the Meat industry and believe it is cruel, and i am completely sympathetic towards the tortue and suffering animals endure in these industrial farms, even then whenever i would purchase meat, i would buy it from a farmers market as i believe they may be alot more humane than the Industrial farms.

I do not believe it is correct for me to be shamed for not complying to a diet which i have been medically advised against, but i also understand from their point of view they dont see the world and food the same way i do, they do not feel the need to count every single calorie they consume within the day, whereas i do, and i presume they also dont have sensory issues with food. I cannot eat Mushrooms and alot of vegan meat substitute bases due to my sensory issues, even if i were able to be vegan my diet would still be limited due to these sensory issues, i see their point of view and im aware they are likely blind to my point of view and how i see things. But im unsure if im in the wrong for even telling her about my meat eating because she does have emotional/mental health issues related to meat and animals which have caused her feeling the need to go vegan. I just felt as if i could confine in her? But i would like someone's perspective on the situation.

Many thanks."

I do taekwondo and weight is a huge factor. It all started when I couldnt reach my my weight category and got some comments from my coach and wasnt allowed to participate in a tournament ever since then I've had my ups and downs with food. I'd have days or weeks were I wouldnt eat at all and others I'd only eat and then feel guilty about it. It stopped from a bit until a few weeks back I had another tournament and was scared to not to be at my weight category so I stopped eating and still didnt lose any weight that day my coach told me to only eat fruit for the day and since then I've been noticing the Ed symptoms I stopped eating for days and when I did eat first thing id do is see the calories and nutrition information if I feel like I ate a lot I'd make myself barf it out and now I can't even digest my food people here suspect it's my gut Flora dying but idk.am I overreacting ?

I've been so anxious about eating over christmas, it's all I can think about.


My husband convinced me that I should let myself eat more over christmas starting today, to not let my ED ruin the Christmas mood and I should let myself enjoy the holiday and eat. I was really nervous because I cannot just eat little bits of this and that, if I eat then I'm going to EAT. A lot.

So earlier we went to the corner shop and bought food for christmas. I've really been craving a trifle, and they didn't have any little pots so I bought a bowl of it.


3 hours later, I'd eaten the whole thing. I did an intense workout after to try make myself feel a little better about it, since I can't purge for a few days (just had a tooth removed, thanks bulimia!).
Anyway, I showed my husband the empty bowl of trifle and he jokingly said, ""aren't you meant to be on a diet?"". He then proceeded to pick me up, pretending he was struggling, and started to jump up and down saying ""let's shake it out of you"".


I immediately burst into tears and said how can you joke about something like that when you know how much I'm struggling? He thought he didn't do anything wrong and refused to apologise, but after a long talk (a snotty talk as I was sobbing my heart out) he understood that he can't joke about things like that.

He's lit candles around the bathroom and drawn me a bath, which I'm currently sitting in, as a way to apologise.


But... the damage is done. I've eaten a whole bloody trifle and now I feel like absolute shit because of my husband. Now I feel like I mustn't eat anything els, which ABSOLUTELY SUCKS because if I knew today was a restricting day I would have saved my calories until this evening when I'm actually hungry :'(

I considered myself ""recovered"" after inpatient and outpatient treatment because I never lost as much weight as that time or even hit rock bottom with my ED. Little did I know that the entire decade-long span of time since then (I'm 26 now) has been fraught with relapses. When I was 23-24 my weight dropped again to an unhealthy degree due to a behavior I didn't really associate with anorexia, and when I regained the weight after spontaneously attempting intuitive eating (in an attempt to lose weight ????) I suddenly realized what had been happening and tried my best to do better. My husband helped me a lot during this time, supporting my eating and exercising in the best possible ways. 

Then I became pregnant in January 2021. Things were fine at first until the third trimester when some of my favorite clothing stopped fitting over my belly. I restricted my intake until the midwives became worried for the baby (she is fine, I was at a healthy weight before I got pregnant and stayed within a healthy range despite the restriction. She was thankfully born larger than most) and then began eating normally again when they informed me that I was risking causing harm. Once again, I almost didn't notice my behaviors creeping back. I knew I was restricting, but I didn't think my restriction was actually making any difference if that makes sense. I thought actually that I was gaining a lot of weight the whole time (I refuse to buy a scale so I didn't know). 

Anyways, I gave birth to my daughter in November and have struggled ever since with the postpartum changes in my body. I have stretch marks on my stomach now. Not a lot, but that was my one big body fear with pregnancy. And, of course, immediately after birth and for about a month my uterus was still shrinking back to its regular size so it looked like I had extra ""fat"" on my stomach for some time, whereas I was previously always willing to like my stomach more than other parts of my body. There were many other little things I may as well not get into, but the point is that pregnancy and birth have all been very triggering. I comforted myself throughout my pregnancy by telling myself that I could control my body and my food after birth, and now I actually am. I'm eating less and less each day, while breastfeeding (which is not a good idea and I know this). And on top of that I've just been ""cleared"" for exercise. 

It feels like things are getting out of control again and honestly I don't know if I can put in the effort towards ""recovery"" right now. And my baby is still so new, still so unaware of her surroundings, and such an easy baby to take care of, that it feels like my eating disorder won't affect her and that I can continue like this without undesired consequences. I just want to feel in control again, you know?

I still haven't told my husband what's been going on in my head."

I'm happy to be home, but the holidays are always a hard time. My mom struggles with a myriad of undiagnosed mental illnesses and GAD, and my dad doesn't really understand the concept of ""mental illness"". Anyways, I'm happy to be with them but sometimes it's painful.

Throughout my childhood and teenage years my dad (and sometimes mom) would tell me that I wasn't wearing enough fabric, which was a contributor to my ano and BDD. The comments started in 4th-5th grade, when I began puberty, and it made me become super insecure. I wore sweaters to try and hide my body because I hated wearing tight fitting clothes. Naturally in middle and high school you want to wear trendy clothes, most of which is tighter fitting. During middle and high school I would hear that I was not wearing ""enough fabric"" several times each day. It only instilled a desire to hide and hate my body more than I already did.

Now, at 22 years of age, I have a significant complex regarding the clothes I wear. I struggle during the summer, because I hate to show my body and any form of skin. It's difficult going out to bars and clubs, because I hate my body in anything that isn't loose. I wear mainly baggy clothes and struggle to leave my house for mundane tasks and errands if I'm not wearing clothes that conceal my body. It's borderline incapacitating.

During the two days I've been home for the holidays, I've heard that I'm not wearing enough fabric twice now. By the way, the outfit that warranted those two comments was a turtle neck and a knee length skirt with knee high rain boots. Today at dinner, the topic of fabric and clothes came up into conversation. Finally, I told my parents that the comments were a major contributor to how I dress now and that I have a complex about how much clothing I wear.

IMMEDIATELY after saying this I become the villain. I get told that I'm sensitive and passive aggressive, and that my younger sisters get the comments too (they don't). My mom shuts down and locks herself in her room, and my dad sticks around. My dad snarkily- and kinda seriously- asks if he starts to compliment me will it undo the insecurities. I answer honestly and say it won't, and that I spent the formative years of my life learning to hate my body, and that I see my body as a cage and that I wish have a different one or to change it to be more conventional. He effectively says ""whatever, I'll still try"", and that's how the convo ended.

I understand it's hard for parents to hear about their shortcomings, but I think that it's still necessary to talk about them. My parents were a major contributor to my ano, and I hate that they act like they didn't assist in creating the toxic conditions for me to develop or prolong one. They don't want to hear that their new-founded Western (and paradoxically untraditional) beauty standards they raised me with destroyed my self esteem and opinions of who I am. It hurts to tell them that they didn't succeed in everything, because I want them to think that they did. I love them, and I know that they ""tried"" to help in their own way after I got my diagnoses in middle school. I know that deep down they know they failed me too. It hurts being honest."

During this time eating as little as possible and celebrating the weight loss was my only solace. Long story short, I eventually started to worry a bit when I started experiencing weakness and dental problems after never even having a cavity before then. This led to my decision to take control of my life and try eating what I wanted without guilt. Well, I ended up being more successful then I had hoped and put on quite a bit of weight over the past few years. This would not be such a big deal except for the fact that I have now become the target of small comments from my family and friends. Comments such as comparing me to thinner people, assuming I wear certain clothing sizes, commenting on my belly and saying I “have filled out.” I don’t think people realize how much these comments hurt, and honestly I don’t even want to tell them because if that’s really how they feel I’d rather they say it than lie to me. I would like to lose a bit of weight for health reasons, but their comments are causing me to want to slip back into unhealthy patterns and drop the weight as fast as possible. I wish I didn’t but I feel like I have something to prove to these people now. And I also miss the praise I used to get when I was thinner. It’s funny because no one was aware of my unhealthy eating habits but they were quick to praise my thin body. I really just need to remind myself that my health is more important than other people’s opinions of my body.

I'm in recovery , doing cbt-e with weight restoration and my fam is very supportive. I've been managing the meal plan fairly well. But physically it's been really difficult. 

I've got more tired, faint and like I can't think straight than before I started to weight restore. That's on top of the feeling cold and having chest pains. And obviously all the anxieties I have to learn to manage, etc. you (may) know the drill. 

Today, I fainted in front of my littlest brother and hopefully he's not scared for life. 

It just feels like my body is getting worse rather than better. And it sucks. It's so difficult to stick to the meal plan and I'm trying my best. I can't do exercise and it just all sucks. And Christmas freaks me out already."

I'm scared of course, for what I'm  guessing are the typical reasons.. also we'll be eating on camera (it's an online class). 

I saw my mom today for the first time after a week and she told me she's ""gone from worried to very very worried"". I love my mom and don't want to worry her, or make her sad. It surprised me because I feel like I've been eating a lot the past week, though I know I probably haven't been eating enough. 

Even though it's totally illogical and confusing to me, I usually have an automatic positive reaction to hearing that I look too thin. Like my reward system is being activated. It makes me feel sick and ashamed to admit this, to myself and others. 

I'm questioning if these thoughts are even my own. Lately I'm convinced that anorexia is a brain worm, it hijacks my thoughts with its own agenda. Almost like those parasites that make creatures do things that harm them, only produced by my own brain. 

This time I just felt fear. Not of getting better, but afraid that I won't. I'm hoping this is progress.. but I'm nervous treatment won't work. I can hear my mom telling me that it's not helpful to think like that because I haven't even tried treatment before. I guess I'd like some encouragement if possible, either from people who are recovering or those on that path. Success stories. I want to get better. I just don't know how yet."

Got back up to a very healthy weight and recovery mindset. Still struggle with ED, but I have been doing okay. 

For the last 4-6 weeks I have been INCREDIBLY nauseated, I believe this to be stress-induced. The only things that really help are things I cannot do all day (lying down with my eyes closed in a silent room, etc). So, every waking moment, I feel as if I am milliseconds away from throwing up. I often do. Lots of dry heaving as well. 

This has made eating incredibly challenging. I am living off of protein shakes and occasional real meals when I can get them down. But the shakes are not nearly enough calories to sustain me. Though my mindset is entirely different than when I was restricting, I am once again at the levels of caloric intake that I was at prior to my hospitalization. 

I do not have a scale in my house anymore, something I learned in treatment. But a few weeks ago I was hospitalized and they weighed me and I have been dropping considerable weight. For now it is okay, I am still in a healthy range, but the nausea seems at no will to resolve, and I'm not sure how long this will go on for...

The ED thoughts are creeping back in. Like, oh, this is *good*... I'm finally losing this weight I put on... I'm getting by just fine on minimal calories... I should wait a couple more hours to have that protein shake... etc. Yet, I'm blaming everything on the nausea, pretending the ED isn't contributing. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. The nausea is very real and I literally cannot just resume eating."

I'm having a lot of confusion about my gender identity and i tried to communicate more but my parents aren't coping with it well.

I think the main thing the ED helped me with was it made it easier to feel numb and ignore negative feelings and accept things instead of getting upset. In hospital and in therapy now, one of the big goals was feeling OK with expressing when I feel sad or angry or scared or whatever. Because in theory the ED wouldn't then be needed.

My mom has caught on that I don’t eat much, she brings it up everyday, she always comments about my weight and tried to get me to weigh myself in front of her but I refuse. She has made me eat in front of her and sometimes I try to hide food and throw it away later. Well that’s a thing I’ve been doing for a while now, pretend I eat/ throw away food.

I don’t like talking about it with people.

I’m sorry for the rant, I haven’t told anyone how I really feel. I always play it off like I’m fine.

So.. my eating disorder has gotten worse.

Monday-thursday I barely ate. I had a glass of vegetable juice one day, then a smoothie another day. And a piece of cake that I didn't even finish because I went to a birthday party. But that's it. I don't know. Maybe that isn't so bad? I know some people could eat even less than that.

I still feel like it's too much. Then today (Friday), I was ravenous and ordered a bunch of binge food. But I managed to have just a cookie and some cheese then didn't actually binge until 6:30 I think. And my binge consisted of I think uhh.. a big bowl of mac and cheese, like 4 cookies, a few chocolate bars. Then I got too full and stopped. And had a cold shower to compensate for the calories. I usually do binge on the weekends, sometimes I purge too.

But usually I compensate in some way. I don't know. I feel like that isn't that bad. I really need to know, is this something I should be worried about? I feel like four days isn't that long."

I was diagnosed with AN and she specializes in EDs. We get along very well. I've been seeing her pretty much weekly for 1.5 years. Anyway, I've been slipping a lot with my intake and ED the past 2 months or so. Strangely, I have not been weighing myself or even thinking about my weight since I threw my scale away beginning of November, so that's not really the issue. I do not have the motivation to even try to eat normally or not give in to ED thoughts/behaviors. And she knows this because she can read me like a book. She basically said she would have more empathy for my relapses right now if I actually put in the effort to thought challenge and eat something. She also said she enjoys working with me but obviously something is not working and she and my nutritionist are not helping, so maybe I need a higher level of care. She was not being mean or anything in the slightest. She is very sweet and I know she 101% genuinely cares about me. I cried on the way home. I cried when I ate dinner. I was going between I need to step it up and get it together if I want her to continue treating me and that I'm just a burden and nobody cares and doesn't understand how difficult this is for me. Eating disorders are fucking hard. They're devastating. After we had that intense conversation, we did some relaxation exercises and that made me a lot less tense. I decided to buy a little notebook to write down my feelings and thought challenging when I do not want to eat so we can go over it when I see her. It is way easier for me to write things than to say things. I know she is NOT against me in any way and really wants to help me... but I can't help but feel like that. I think it is just the eating disorder voice. Anybody else feel that way with their team? How do you overcome it?

Since our session 2 days ago, I have been trying a lot harder to eat my meals and I'm more mindful about it so it did end up helping, I guess."

I forgot how hard this was. I'm scared, my brain is going haywire. I'm terrified of the weight gain - I feel like I'm out of control, not sick enough, that I'm just using this as an excuse to be lazy and binge. I feel more mental hunger than anything else right now. I wake up at 4am hungry, despite having gone to bed uncomfortably full. I feel like what I'm doing is wrong, and that I'm going to make it worse, that I've replaced one bad habit for another of uncontrollably devouring everything in sight. I'm terrified of what's going to happen to me and my body as a result.

I guess, put simply, I could just use some reassurance right now. That what I'm doing is okay, and experiencing is normal, and that these urges will go away over time with consistent eating. That weight gain is okay, and part of the process. Even if I already know these things, I really need to be reminded and hear them coming from a voice outside of my own brain right now."

I am 23 and have BDD.My entire life has been a battle with body image and when I was 9 I developed Anorexia and besides a month of a hiccup - I was ""recovered"" by age 14.

Since then it had just been me and my BDD... A part of me feels that we don't recover a 100% if we don't get professional help like CBT and the like, but my parents just force fed me and well we were poor so the recovery for me was more fear induced and religious than anything. I've never been to therapy for this.

I am autistic and disabled and I can't hold a job and am currently struggling to finish my last year at uni so getting professional help is practically impossible at this rate.

My ED started due to my BDD for sure, but what surprised me was how quickly I became physically repulsed by food. It was so bad that even liquids made me gag.

Two weeks ago it started again after an entire decade of being well. It started with my skipping breakfast. It started as nausea at the thought of food and the textures and scents.

This morning the sight of myself and thought of the 2 chicken strips I had for ""breakfast""  made me almost vomit in front of the mirror. My BDD has also gotten worse as I have been having breakdowns related to my body image. I haven't worked out in a year so I have gained a bit of weight and life at home has been very hard and so has school. I've been having meltdowns often and everything is out of control. I just want to cry because I realise that I may have relapsed and this time it was so sneaky and the worst part is that I feel comfort in the idea of relapsing. It's been two weeks but I already fantasize about the end result and I've been body checking so often.

I don't want to relapse. I don't want to be unhealthy and hurt my body this way, but I am so disgusted by myself and food that I am almost always nauseated.

Please link me resources or anything. Please. I need help and I am so afraid. I don't want to relapse and I know I have.. I want to stop this before it gets worse."

My parents and older sister vividly remember me always going to the bathroom to wash my hands, when I was really just managing my social anxiety as early as 2nd grade. Which was done by spending time alone in the bathroom.

Anytime I look at the definition of anorexia, it's specific to forced starvation. 

I am simply not feeling hungry because my stomach hurts cause I'm nervous (at nothing in particular). To me, this is not intentional. I know it's disordered eating caused by my anxiety (which I am seeking treatment for) but confused on it being specific to anorexia.

I have had all sorts of issues, but have settled into anorexia, with my most recent bout just before the pandemic. My husband, at the time, thought it was due to medication for migraines I was not eating and was so thin and malnourished. I did not tell him otherwise. 

He is now fully aware that I have an ED and a long history, although I can never bring myself to say the actual word “anorexia” to him. Lately, I have been starting to restrict again. I didn’t think he really noticed. I figured I could get it under control— just lose a bit and then be fully under control. 

That was before the atomic bomb dropped. My husband comes home one day from what I thought was an appointment with a nutritionist and announces he has been approved for and wants to get a gastric sleeve surgery. I should say he’s not morbidly obese. He does not have health problems. No one was more shocked and horrified than me. I am terrified he is making a massive mistake and he will suffer physically and mentally. I love that he wants to ensure he remains healthy and I want to have a long healthy life with him….but yeah.

I hear this and was already in a not great place…sort of in the edge of a cliff. After this, I jumped. I began a rapid and horrific spiral into major restriction and a need to exercise myself into oblivion. My husband is 5’4 and I’m nearly 5’10. I have started obsessing over the idea that I will be his “fat wife.” I obsessively track my intake and write nasty things to myself in the tracker if I don’t see results. The feeling of control and power i get from this seems to help in a situation I feel I have no say in and one I am terrified about. I am actually frightening myself with this spiral. I have a therapist I see weekly, but I am not sure that’s enough anymore. 

I’m not sure where I’m going with this or what I’m asking for…I just needed to share with people who understand how my mind is working right now, I guess?"

..

 *Possible trigger warning for next bit!*



I have this compulsive action where I kind of ""clench"" my lower abdomen. I do it over probably 300 a day, maybe more. It disrupts my sleep and I know it bothers my roommates. 

I also have another one where I'll push my stomach down, hard. Like roll my arms over it over and over until I feel satisfied. My roommates and parents have both gotten after me for the behaviour, calling it out, shaming me for it, saying it's embarrassing to be around me, etc.

I've explained why I do it, that I can't help it, but they don't seem to understand. I've told my roommates recently ""Trust me, I hate it way more than you do. I wish I didn't do it I promise. I don't want to do this.""

Since I've said that, they've stopped pointing it out as much, but they still stare or frown at it and it makes me so ashamed and uncomfortable.

I also have these ""episodes"" where I'll be running to the bathroom in these windowed periods of a couple minutes to body check over and over and over again.
This will occur multiple times a day. I hate it so much. Like I won't be able to function or think about/do anything else if I don't. 

Also Everytime I sit down (typically when I game), I'll have to place a pillow against my stomach and wrap a shirt around really tight and that seems to give me a bit of relief.

It especially gets worse after I eat, because  my stomach bloats (because yeah it has food in it, it makes sense, but to my ED it makes it freak out).

Just a mini-rant I guess but I was also wondering if anyone else has these compulsions? I've heard of people body checking, but even upon researching I haven't heard of people doing the stomach pushing thing or the stomach clenching. 

The clenching is fucking horrible. After the hundredth time that day it just permanently hurts and I'll have to take pain killers to help ease it. And even then that doesn't stop how distressing and annoying it is, to say the least.

I wanted to go on an anxiety mediation that was stronger than the quetiapine I've been taking. I've tried extended and full release but they only put me to sleep. I asked my doctor if I could try out Xanax and he wouldn't let me because of the addictive properties, but I've tried every SSRI and nothing's worked so I feel put of options.

Sidenote hope everyone is doing okay! ❤️ Sending lots of love :)"

I don't know where to turn to anymore, and I don't know what to do anymore... I'm just going to start from the beginning..

I am 24 (f), and have had battles with food and my body image my entire life. 
Growing up, I was picked on because I was ""the  f a t  girl"", and even though my family never stopped my comfort eating, they would also pick on my weight.---I had some traumatic situations happen to me as a child, and I recently learned back then I did look toward food for ""happiness""...

When I was 16,  I decided to admit to someone I had a crush on for that entire year that I had feelings for them. Their answer to me was they think I am a great person, but I am not their type because they aren't attracted to ""big girls"", which I was my biggest at this time--and being under 5'5 in height, my weight showed more... I don't know why my past crush saying that hurt me so badly...but it hurt me to the point of breaking me...
In this time I started purging. I still liked to eat for comfort...but everytime I felt I ate too much, I'd purge. I also decided to join the gym at this time. I would purge after the gym because my mind had a very misconstrued thought that it would ""eliminate any remaining calories"" (thanks ED tumblr for all the really scary rituals and habits...)
By 18. (without saying any of my past or present weight), I had dropped over 100lbs. 

I remember there was a short period of time at 19 when I didn't have disordered eating or exercising habits. I wasn't eating for comfort, but I was eating more than I had been...this was something I assumed was good for me because the job I was at is physically demanding (still at, we will get there later).
I was living with my dad at this time, who had made a really shitty comment toward me...
It was the summer...I decided to wear a crop top and he poked my stomach and said ""oh you're pudgy, you can't wear that, go change""
When I expressed to him it hurt me, and I wanted to wear what I wanted (because you know, I am a grown ass adult paying him rent and have a full time job😒), all he said was ""guys won't find that attractive. you look like trailer trash.""

I started purging again. I also moved out shortly after that-- and lived with and was in a relationship with a guy who suffered from anorexia, he wasnt necessarily in recovery, but he would eat; just not a lot, barely around me, and would only eat certain things or at certain times. when he would relapse badly, he would replace food with smoking (a lot) of weed. he also went on very long walks a lot.
He knew about my purging. I scared myself away from it because I ended up having a seizure after one bad time. So, I stopped purging. But I became afraid of food... because I felt as if I couldn't purge, I truly couldn't ""enjoy"" food.
I eventually fell into his habits at first I guess? I just stopped eating, and smoking a lot of weed. I would go on walks with him. I was with this person for almost 2 years. We ended the relationship for other reasons unrelated to our EDs.

I got better again for a little bit when I was 22. I was ""eating normally"" (aka not replacing it with a substance). I was working in a restaurant at this time, so I was around food all the time--eventually I became unbothered.

 I left the restaurant to go back to my old job in February of this year because of covid though. The restaurant had to let go of a bunch of staff because of no dine-in service, I needed the money, so I ended up going to my old job in a cosmetics warehouse in their online orders department. 
When I left the restaurant, I was at a weight I was ""uncomfortable"" with. I got scared again, and fell into my old habits of living on caffeine, smoking weed, barely eating or not eating, and since my current job is physically demanding; I used it to my advantage for my 'exercise rituals'. 

My current partner noticed my ""new"" (new to him, old to me) habits, questioned me about it. I never wanted to say I had anorexia though, because I didn't want to diagnose myself. I told him I have always had a problem with food. A few months ago, I ended up fainting while we were out...and that scared him enough to take me to the doctor to get a diagnosis.
I have been on the waiting list ever since...

I am sincerely trying to get better without their help...but it's so fucking hard when I have never been diagnosed...so I can't get proper help...but all I know is:
 my hair is falling out
there are always bruises on my body from the SMALLEST bumps
 or sometimes my boyfriend can hug me too tight and it'll leave bruises on my shoulders
I feel like I am about to pass out all the time
I genuinely don't feel hungry anymore, 
but when I do eat I either feel nauseous or I throw up(not purging) from being so nauseous.
It hurts to sleep because I can feel my bones against my own bed, I can't even sit down in the lunch room at work anymore because the chairs hurt me.
I've stopped smoking so much to see if it helps...but I guess it's not??
My own boyfriend is afraid of having sex with me half of the time because he is legitimately afraid of hurting me...not to mention he tells me everyday how scared he is of me losing my life due to my health. I know in my heart he can't help me because of his worry....


and I don't know what to do anymore...I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't know how to get help being undiagnosed...I don't know how to get the help without admitting myself into emergency...I can't even do that because I unfortunately can't afford to take time off of work. 
I am lost. I am scared. I am tired of hurting myself like this. I want to be able to sleep without waking up in the middle of the night sobbing from pain... I want to finally be done with this fucking demon we call eating disorders..."

it doesn’t sound so bad, it just made me feel so uncomfortable considering she KNOWS about some of my discomforts. i’ve met the girl she was talking about, she’s thinner than i am. if my friend thinks her body is gross, what does she think about me? 

i’ve had problems with this friend before, never anything really bad, she just does a couple things that i’m not super comfortable with (i can’t tell her though, i don’t like opening up to friends in general, but i’d have to talk a lot about my issues to explain). nothing bad, just sore subjects for me personally.

for a little context, i’m transmasc, and i don’t think anyone has the right to comment on anyone else’s body or eating habits. unless you’re their doctor, it’s none of your business and you’re just being an ass. but judgement from others makes me feel gross about my own body. being raised with fear foods being a big issue from my abuelo and mom, and the overwhelming urge to be up to everyone else’s standards has kinda messed me up. as a kid i was very thin, i’m now a teenager and i’m midsized. although i’m “healthy” and this is just how my body looks (i’m mexican), i hate it. i hate how other people make me feel for it.

i feel so gross. i was doing pretty well for a bit there, but right now the thought of eating anything makes me feel uncomfortable. do my friends think of me like that? do they think “oh those clothes are NOT good for his body type”?  i hate this. she’s never made THIS direct of a remark about someone, why now? she’s seen me more than most of my other friends, what if she thinks that about me?"

When the cops finally arrived, lo and behold,they didn't make me move, they made her move. I wanted to press charges for false imprisonment but the cops said it was a civil matter?? 


I have PTSD, I don't do well with confrontation, but I'm trying to assert myself when it's right because I was a punching bag for so long to my abusers. 

I have anorexia too,and this has caused a massive flare up. I only ate a banana yesterday and couldn't get out of bed. I don't know what to do. 

I am going to speak to an attorney and law enforcement about pressing charges once again, but  I don't know what to do about me."
rfr5bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/rfr5bf/dont_mind_me_just_venting_a_sec/,"Don't mind me, just venting a sec.",9,2,1639432207.0,"  I'm so so so fucking tired. I've been dealing with anorexia for I don't remember how fucking long. As a kid I could easily stack away 10 plates and a couple desserts at a golden corral and think very little of it. It was comforting then, and terrifying now. 
  All the years of being nit picked, judged, abused and hurt. I'm tired of the mess that's my mind telling me ""ew you fat fuck, did you really just finish a bag of candy?"", I know it's in my head, I know what I see isn't how others see me, so why me? Why can't I just accept myself? I hate compliments and comments with a passion because they disgust me, they never feel genuine even when I'm told they are. 
  You can't just tell me ""you look cute"" knowing that I have absolutely zero self worth after years of any shards of confidence and actual love for myself being ground down into nothingness. I'm a shell of the exuberant, caring, curious, naive five year old, the last time I even remotely remember being me..at least that's what I think was me. It's been so long since I felt comfortable truly with myself. I'm disgusted with myself, going into the dreading the bathroom mirror because I'll see what my mind thinks is what I look like, what I think I look like.
   I tie my apron on at work to even try to begin to see what I even look like, turning and hoping that ""ooh! Maybe I look thinner now!"" Just to stop midway and stare at each and every single fucking flaw there. My stomach is fat, my thighs are a nightmare, my arms could probably make me fly with these batwings o'mine, my cheeks are so fat I look like a squirrel, why am I so wide, why can't I have a bird cage-like body naturally, surely I'd be a little happier if I did. Yet I'm never happy seeing thin, beautiful people only to look at myself and instantly see a fat, muffin topped, loose skinned, ugly bastard staring back.
   I haven't seen a scale in so long I can't even begin to think about how much I weigh now. Even if I did I wouldn't be happy with it either. I'm never satisfied. It's been so long that I don't even feel hunger anymore, and the once in a blue moon that somehow I do, I feel happy and start acting as if I were that 5 yr old again. Only to look at everything I've gotten, feeling it steaming in my face and smelling like .. well, food my mind starts racing about all that's gonna happen when I eat it, if I can even bring myself to do it.
   Only being able to nibble, barely making even a noticeable dent before feeling sick, and crying over it like a toddler. The kicker is, is that I work in the food industry. I love cooking, I love creating in general, yet I can't even enjoy my own creations because I feel disgusting and sick even attempting.
   My boyfriend, I love him to death but he is no help with it either. I've been pushing to recover, trying to eat more, trying to change how I see myself yet it's diminished when I hear ""you need to eat."" ""Make yourself something before you leave work today"" ""did you eat?"" ""Listen, if you don't eat I'll make you something regardless if you want it or not"" in response to me saying no and telling him that I don't even feel hungry and that it'd be a waste, he'd be much happier wasting food rather than me eating on my own. Hell, even the food I do make myself goes to waste. I know I have to eat, I know I need to get better, yada yada. I will...maybe...
  He's so concerned and cares a lot but is utterly useless because in his own words ""I was helping you like I'd like to be helped"" I didn't ask you to help me specifically for that reason alone. You help me like you want to be helped, and that's not going to work, you can't make me recover, only be there while I try. Only a total of 6 people know that I have it, two of my managers, my only friend, him, and his older sister because I asked her for help (through him). I'm tired of my breakfasts only consisting of my vape or a cigarette and some water, my lunch being the smells of my job, and my dinner being whatever I pick off of my own food because I can't bring myself to eat it. 
  Food repulses me. Eating repulses me. I know I need it to survive, but honestly, I've been long at the point of not even caring if I live or die. I never have. I tried killing myself at 8 years old for crying out loud. 
  Fuck, then the imposter syndrome kicks itself into high gear whenever I snack or actually clear a plate. At this point I'm ready to give up, just continue wasting away til I'm nothing but a weird looking draugr of a corpse. Sorry, this is everywhere and nowhere all at once. I'm just tired of it all, I'm tired of my illnesses, I'm tired of the pressure and stress, I'm tired of being scared, I don't even enjoy the way I look when I even do manage to lose weight from a plateau because there's always something, I could always go lower, I don't need this, this doesn't look right, why am I still fat here, etc. If a dirt nap is what shuts it all up and stops it forever then so be it.
  Again, sorry for the mess of a post, I can never gather my thoughts well enough to make something enjoyable or comprehensive enough for anyone to really care to go through. Thanks for reading if you did."

I have question. What exactly does recovery in ED look like? As i am eating more, all i think about everyday is if i will gain my weight again, if the food i just ate was a good/bad decision, my calories, how often i should be working out, etc…. 

I’ve watched many youtube videos on recovery, and I’ve definitely challenged many of my food fears and changed my eating behavior. Yet, the mental thoughts of my ED and whether or not recovery is working takes a huge toll of my time. i also cannot stop body checking, and even though this ed has taken part of my social life, i cant help but feel ok with it. I still struggle socializing as my ED thoughts make me want to stay home where my safe foods are. I would say ive been recovering, but I terribly MISS my old body when i was sick, and how i looked. i was miserable on the inside mentally and physically, yet i finally loved how i look. 

ive seen 2 therapists, but they have not been helpful. after talking to them i still dont feel any better, and they rarely discussed my ed and how to cope with wanting to relapse. i stopped seeing them because it felt like they weren’t getting to me. 

Im currently awaiting college acceptances and the chance of my acceptance is one of the only things that is helping me recover. Yet, i know that if i dont get accepted into my dream school i will definitely relapse. 

What exactly does recovery look like? what am i suppose to discuss with a therapist? I am eating more, yet my thoughts are still so loud in my head. the “ed voice” people talk about feels like its my normal voice. i miss the worst parts of my ed a lot and i miss my old weight."

then Aug - Dec fell again into a mix of v low restriction, b/p, over exercise all, eating maintenence. all of it id experienced Until December.

But now for the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is fail restriction & basically binge, only purg!ng a little, a few times. 

ive probs been eating around maintenance, but still mainly vegan- ignoring timings and not rly measuring any food or cal counting which i feel so guilty for loosing even more control.  

my body is disgusting, im more depressed than ive ever been but i dont think thats soley from my ED; although the depression is fuelling it. 

 ive been ignoring my body and how it looks, not weighing or stressing over it only stressing over the loss of control and 'discipline' and my ed 'disappearing'.
 
now i feel like all im doing is eating & have little desire too restrict - waiting until its all too much & i can see again how quickly i can loose it all and get back too my lw. 

so uncomfortable with everything neither option seems appealing i keep telling myself if i reach below my lw by 31 jan (my bday) i can get help.

 i feel like i need too just get bored of eating and b repulsed by it until i can hardcore restrict again. i don't want to recover but i'm holding hope that by mid next year i will have gotten much much worse so maybe i can start then. ik u shouldn't wait till that point but i cant imagine rn wanting too let go of this life ever. 

i just want too shrivel & wither away. be left alone too starve w no responsibility for anything outside of existing. i hate this life. pissed i cant restrict as well as i used too and even more uncomfortable that part of me doesnt want too right now.  fml"

I'm trying to support a friend with ED, and...I've been pretty convinced that I ought not force them to recover. That recovery is something they should do, if/when they feel like doing it, and me trying to force it on them will just make them push me away.

But now, I'm feeling really drained because they seem to be getting to a point where they'll require medical intervention again, and idk what to do. Do I continue with going along/being there for them without making any worry I have, apparent? Or ought I indicate that I'm uncomfortable/feeling heavy because of the actions they're taking? I feel guilty about both options.

Thank you for reading this!

Edit: I told them what I thought, a month ago, and they haven't pushed me away which is something I'm glad about. At the same time, they've grown a little more wary and are guarded around me (saying they don't want to say something that would disappoint me). Will update as time goes by."

All because of this stupid disorder. She started asking me some questions about my diet and weight loss cause I lost a lot really quickly, and ended up opening up to her about a relapse with this ED. (I’ve been seeing her well over a year so it’s not like she’s some complete stranger) She said it could realistically take a good year before my hair is actually healed from the malnutrition it was experiencing. She recommended I start using the entire olaplex system, increase my biotin, and of course, stay in recovery. I want to keep recovering but I feel so triggered knowing I have short hair and not feeling that I’m thin enough to “properly” pull it off. For some reason I think I cannot have short hair unless I meet a certain LW, cause that’s the only way the haircut will look good. Anyone been in a similar situation as me?

I was only hospitalized for it once as I got to an extremely low weight. The crazy thing though is that it never got so so bad that I had crazy symptoms that scared me or anything. However, as I have gotten older, these poor decisions have gotten scarier and scarier. 
Last month I hadn’t eaten for just 2 days and I fell down unconscious in front of my house 2 or 3 times. I would drift in and out of reality, jolt my arms/legs/hands/feet frantically, and slur my words and have a hard time putting my thoughts together. Luckily, my roommate came outside and assisted me and I ate a little bit and felt a little better. I just boiled it down to me passing out or whatever. 
However, last night this happened again. Yesterday I attended a rave that I was looking forward to for like a whole ass month. However just a few hours in I collapsed on the floor. Honestly, I don’t even remember when or how I collapsed. All I ember was getting into the bathroom with my group and letting them know I didn’t feel good. I came in and out of consciousness for what felt like a lifetime but was only like 30 minutes. During this time I was out of control with my body’s spastic movements and even the words coming out of my mouth. It almost felt like I was playing in a simulation of some sort.

I had just relapsed with my self harm, and they were kinda pissed at me, but we were still just trying to have fun and joke around. Then, Oh Ana by Mother Mother started playing. We both laughed a little at how ironic the song felt at the moment, and started joking around, when they said,""If you tried to kill yourself by cutting through your neck, there would be too much fat there for you to actually do it."" Obviously, I was really caught off guard. They'd made fun of my weight before, but this specific comment seemed so outta left field. They thought my reaction was funny, but I was just really hurt.

They later apologized after I told them it made me feel bad, saying that they ""Knew they shouldn't have said it"" and that the comment was ""just an impulse."" However, I find that a little hard to believe because before I directly called them out, whenever I referenced the event they'd start laughing, as if it was some funny inside joke we had. I forgave them and said it was ok, but honestly I just didn't want them to feel bad.

Now, I'm not gonna blame them for my ED. There are so many different factors that affect it, and I've always had a bad relationship with food, but that comment sorta sent me into a spiral. The little self confidence I had left, and I started criticizing myself more and more. That comment still plays in my head all the time. Making fun of someone's weight is really fucked up, ED or not, and it really fucking hurt me."

Lately she’s just been calling people ugly and calling people fat that are on tiktok & insta and they have normal bodies just a bit of bloating. 
But I’m just super hurt and I wish she would’ve handled it better. Idk if I want her to be apart of this difficult time in my life. I think maybe I should put our friendship on a break."

is it normal too go thru phases in ur ed where you just dont care anymore / have lost the reason too restrict or engage in ed behaviours and r just kinda ""normal"" for a few weeks


i feel like i *feel* so much more when im restricting or purging etc even if its mainly shitty feelings and thoughts.  but the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is basically binge eat or eat normally with no compensatory behaviours. 


i just feel so numb & my life so bland that i dont rly care right now too cry over it anymore or too franticly restrict the next day.its not like this doesnt make me hella uncomfortable. i just feel nothing no good or bad emotions just uncomfortableness & worry my ed is slipping away. not caring enough on either side too continue restriction or eating normally.


i cycle alot thru different phases like p/b, pure restriction, over excersize, lax abuse etc. 
but rn im not rly doing any of that for the past two weeks and im scared my ed has gone or smth. 
ik its not rly true- the thoughts r there, theres still things i refuse too eat and behaviours i use. 
i feel disgusting & am planning on how too loose the weight but i just feel Nothing rn & its causing me too not care enough about if im gaining etc.  


is this just part of a cycle do other ppl w eds kinda sometimes go too a point of remission?? idk what too call it. 


i feel so guilty and fake because the emotional response of my actions isn't there rn. 
but its not there with Anything; my entire life feels like this.

Sometimes I revel in my illness, enjoying the false stability I trick myself into thinking I have. Other times, I'm just hit with the realization of,""Oh. I'm not in control, am I?"" Fun diets and cute log calendars don't hide the fact that I'm slowly killing myself in silence for a happiness I know anorexia can't and won't give me. The slightest bit of euphoria I get when stepping on a scale doesn't undo the permanent physical and mental damage I'm causing myself. I can take a million hot baths, but it won't change the fact that I'm fucking freezing all the time. Even with all of that, the thought of getting help is one I can't stomach. The knowledge that I'll need to suffer a little more, a little longer for anyone to realize I have a problem seems to numb my entire being.

Where I’m at rn: I’m 29, cis woman, have never been hospitalized or been in inpatient or anything.  Have had disordered eating since puberty - binged ages 12-15, bulimia 15-23, anorexia 23-now and it’s worse than it’s ever been. ED stems a lot from trauma as a coping mechanism, comorbid conditions are CPTSD and bipolar (the latter I take meds for, and I have an amazing trauma therapist I see weekly). My BMI is low and I know that I’m underweight—like my protruding bones make it really painful to sit or get up from sitting, have had like three periods in two years, none of my clothes fit me anymore, massive stomach pains when I eat something outside of my routine, and last time I weighed myself it was…disturbing. To the point where I didn’t feel that little thrill of pride or satisfaction. Just terror. I’ll just leave it at that. 

I got my vitals done a couple months ago and they all looked fine, and even though I’ve experienced heart pains for a while my EKG came out fine then too. I have lost some weight since then though. I don’t fast for days at a time, but my daily calorie count is very minimal and the times I eat are militantly regimented. I recently found out about ‘refeeding syndrome’ but I’m not sure if my situation qualifies as being at risk for it. 

I have tried FERVENTLY to get treatment. But after months of phone calls and appeal letters it’s a no-go. I’m still going to pursue support, but I am realizing that I need to get into the mindset of recovery and not wait until I can access treatment (literally yall I’ve tried everything, being an adult with low/no income makes this close to futile but trust me I’ve tried and continue trying so PLEASE don’t say ‘try to get treatment’ cus I’m white-knuckling the fuck out of trying to get it every day). I want to try and take proactive steps on my own. I just want my fucking life. 

Basically I’m hoping to incorporate recovery into my life in ways that are slow and gentle and try my best to avoid backlash like it has in the past. I have some ideas but I’m really hoping to hear from anyone who’s willing to share about what they focused most on at the beginning stages of recovery and at what pace? In terms of eating more/dealing with extreme hunger/introducing fear foods/ways to like…idk, stay in the saddle?? Or just anything?

Thank you for reading and I hope for all of you healing and support"

Here goes, when I was younger I was diagnosed with anorexia Nervosa which earned me a stay at the children's mental ward (idk what it's called English isn't my native language) when I was 15. I had a few slip ups here and there, working in an industry which required me to stay skinny, but nothing like a full blown relapse.
I'm now 22 and stressing out of my mind with college and I find myself relying on old restricting habits to cope with stress, I think about what I eat a lot and will feel guilty for days if I've eaten anything extra. I find myself unconsciously body checking, compulsively touching my stomach, cheekbones and collarbones. 
But the thing is I still eat what most people would call healthy meals, I'm just extremely careful. My dad seems to have noticed this as he constantly remarks on how much weight I've lost and urges me to eat. I want to tell something, I want to tell him or my sister but at the same time I'm afraid that once I've told them, they'll make me eat and I'll gain weight. I'm scared of relapsing but at the same time, as sick as it sounds, I like being that way, and being back feels almost nostalgic.
What should I do ?


UPDATE : I contacted my local ED listening hotline and I booked an appointment with a therapist, I'm getting help and I'm trying to reintroduce dairy products into my diet, I'll get to carbs when I'm feeling a bit stronger. Good luck to you all and thank you for your advice, let's stay strong 💪"

only my house is triggering af, my brother hardly eats (not an ed thing just forgets or cant be bothered/ isnt hungry).

i was planning too eat dinner and my food for day when me and my brother had a huge argument & now im back too wanting too restrict cause im down again. 
on top of that he told me hed not eaten anything yet when i asked him which made me even more guilty bcos id had bfast AND lunch already which i spent hrs trying too justify. 

why is this shit so so hard. i feel so lonely but im also scared af ill continue eating this way into the new yr. 
it feels like every 'counter-action'  i do or behaviour i dont use or food i eat, my ed slips away more.

I haven’t had a relapse since high school, 7 years ago. Instead I started binging. Switched an ed for another. But I can’t even do that anymore. Every time I eat I start sobbing. I have so much self hate for myself so this happening, the break up, makes me feel like it’s my fault because I’m fucking disgusting. 

I eat at work in the morning though, need energy for my job. But my job is also a distraction so I’m fine eating then but when I leave I’m worthless. I don’t deserve to eat. If I eat I can’t sleep, if I eat I gain weight, if I eat the breakup is my fault. 

Also the feeling of being hungry is so nice because at least I can control those pains. It gives me some control back. Uhh. I’m joining the gym, don’t know if that will help or make things worst. We shall see."

So first off I'm not the typical person to have a problem with this. I'm male, 27, and besides a brief bout of bulimia when I was 14 don't have a history of eating disorders. My life has always been hugely influenced by being overweight; it has affected my social standing during my school years, my dating later in life, and my self-worth my whole life.

That said, this didn't start as a weight loss strategy. I was on some medication that suppressed my appetite and basically made me believe if I stopped eating it'd cure my anxiety. I came off them, have hunger again, and now despite the fact I have hunger again I'm doing my utmost not to eat, including smoking cigarettes. I'm still eating every day or 2 currently, but I find myself trying to restrict myself to say, a tin of tuna or something else small for the day if I do eat. 

Yesterday I had to call in sick from work because I felt too dizzy to work. The day before others noticed I have slowed done considerably (it's a fast paced job). Yesterday I had 2 meals so that today I will be able to work. Today I feel a little ashamed and disgusted with myself and don't want to eat as punishment.

This didn't start as weight loss strategy but it's definitely headed there and while I have a history of depression/anxiety, this is new to me. I think it's also a means of self-punishment and taking my life back, because I feel like I've lost all control. I've recently gone through the breakup of a toxic relationship, moved to night shift which is a strong stressor so if intense life changes can cause this that might be why.

I guess I'm just looking for some guidance. At what point does this become an eating disorder and not just a short-term bad behaviour? What should I do about this?"

For context - I am, by no means, underweight. I'm actually an ex-fat person... In high school, at 5'8 I was 200+ lbs. Over the course of the last 10 years, I've built the best relationship with food I've ever had. In HS, I *wanted* to be ana, but didn't have the willpower not to eat. Thank god for that.

Fast forward to today, I'm a competitive endurance athlete. At one point, I was seeing a nutritionist 2x a month and was training 5x a week with a personal coach - it was a second full-time job. My nutritionist had me counting calories & macros every day. I was still about 180lbs at the time, and she knew I wanted to lose weight to be a faster cyclist, so that's what we were working on.

That was in 2019. Back then, it felt like I couldn't eat enough. But since the pandemic, there hasn't been nearly the amount of racing that there was prior, so I stopped working with both my coach and nutritionist, and have lost my bottomless appetite. But for the last half of 2021, everyday I think to myself, even when I'm at my most hungry, *""I just don't feel like eating.""* 

There are no negative thoughts about food that come with those feelings, but I still choose to let the hunger pangs happen & ignore them until I finally find the motivation to cook. The fact of the matter is that cooking/eating is plain inconvenient. Not to mention, I am a *huge* food snob, so I wouldn't dare eat frozen/prepared foods or anything processed that require little time to prepare.

I completely unsure of whether or not these thoughts are early signs of an ED, and I'm here asking if those were thoughts anyone else had at the beginning of their ED.

Thanks in advance!"

I am terrified of gaining weight. I'm terrified of not being skinny. I want it more than anything, I'd do anything to be skinny. And yet it's so easy for me to eat. I count my calories. I avoid food. I eat less and less. But it's so easy for me to just go back to normal. I'm not scared of the food I'm just terrified of how it affects my body. I love food and love eating. But I won't because I want to be skinny so badly. I can eat easily, it's just dealing with the immense guilt and fear of never being skinny after that makes me feel sick and sob. It's easy to eat but not easy to deal with the consequences. Everyone says I'm supposed to fear food when I have an eating disorder, and I don't think I do. I'm not scared of food. I'm scared of a life where I always look like this. And I'm terrified of harming myself for good. I was already deficient in so many vitamins before I started getting really bad. I'm really scared of hurting myself but at the same time I feel like it doesn't fucking matter if I hurt myself because it feels like I'd rather die trying to be skinny than never be it. I feel like I don't really have an eating disorder because I only fit half of the stereotypes. If I don't have an ED, I'm not sick, I don't need to recover. But I want to recover. I want to be healthy and I want my girlfriend to stop worrying about me. But I don't want to gain weight again. I'll do anything to not look like I used to. I'm not at an unhealthy weight now, I was overweight when I started. Which is why nobody fucking notices that something's wrong. I'm constantly praised for my weight loss. I'm a healthy weight now, I'm just achieving it unhealthily. But I don't know what to do. I want to start going back to normal. I want to eat again. I want to enjoy food again. But if I do I'll just go back to what I was like before and people will be horrible to me again and I won't fit into the new clothes I bought that I fit into now. I fucking hate this. I wish I had an option to healthily lose weight but my parents cook unhealthy food and give me twice the healthy portion size of a normal person. I can't exercise without extreme pain because I have a pain problem with my legs and hips. I feel fucking hopeless. Starving is my only option. But I don't want to starve. But I don't want to stop getting skinny until my stomach is flat and I fit into cute clothes and look pretty."

My new smile gave me confidence - I began the process of finding a husband, got married , graduated university, and started my new life.

Now though that it has been just over two years with my new smile, I am beginning to become more anxious and ashamed of it.

tbh the only reason i started binging was bc of stereotypes. whenever i see a girl post about her ed, i see comments saying ""all girls starve themselves"" and so i thought 😨if thats true then my ed probably isnt valid. so i told myself it was okay to binge, to prove to myself my ed is real🤩and now im stuck in this horrid binge restrict cycle. i have no self control whatsoever. i binge as many times as i restrict. wtf do i do."

it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. ( the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much/ dont have the energy or just dont *care* enough tbh. ) 
 
The normal eating with little guilt (not because it was safe foods or id compensated- just genuinley alright w eating it ) only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. 

its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction,  trying too make it worse than last time. 
but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat/ feel normal for good- but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. 

idk. just feel so invalid and fake and undisciplined. is this even an ed. ugh"

Have a good day<3 You look very beautiful/handsome/attractive today.
      Right so I (16, male) think I'm developing some sort of ed, and my mum and I are going to the doctors for an appointment I have on Thursday. I just moved to a new place (and therefore also a new hospital) so I'm guessing they wanna discuss my medication before prescribing any more and just talk about my health and make sure I'm not getting any bad side effects. Well as I'm sure most of you know, weighing is a big part of certain check ups and I think it'll be this time. 
      Now since I'm not actually underweight that in itself isn't an issue. The issue is that my mum is coming with and she will 100% mention how I've lost weight recently, because she thinks it has to do with the medication, which it doesn't. On top of this, a few weeks ago the doctor asked my mum about my blood pressure, height, weight, etc. and I told her my actual weight since it was going to a doctor and lying to a doctor doesn't seem like a good idea.
     Well yesterday I was not-so-pleasantly reminded of this and started to panic. The weight she gave the doctor was way more than I was last time I weighed myself (yesterday night). I'm really scared this will cause an issue.
      Now, assuming I keep my mouth shut and don't tell her or the doctor that it's not the pills they'll change my prescription (appetite loss is a side effect). Which again, scares the shit out of me because I need the pills to function. But I also don't want my mum to know that I'm probably developing an ed.
     I don't wanna get treated for an eating disorder cause I neither feel sick or skinny enough, and I also don't wanna get put off of my meds.

like why do i feel like im constantly fluttering between my healthy brain telling me too bloody give life a try and get out of this hole, and the other telling me too just go deeper into my ed than before- and Then i can recover and think about how too sort my life out and ill be ready and worthy too recover. 

neither sounds appealing so im just in this uncomfortable middle of not wanting too engage in either. ik ill think different by the morning & probs restrict but i'm so tired of this.

Im currently in residential treatment and I think it’s fair to say I’m completely miserable. I miss home really bad and we aren’t allowed any passes or visitors because of covid protocols. Im several thousand miles from home and I don’t even have the privacy or opportunity to call home. I know the holidays are coming up and I can’t think anything but ‘I don’t want to be here for Christmas’. I know how easy it can be for the ED to use any excuse to try and get out of treatment, but I honest to god just can’t stand it. This isn’t my first time in treatment, and I’ve gotten all the skills group memorized like the back of my hand. There’s not much more here except food, but being a picky eater who isn’t allowed more that 3 dislikes, it’s bad enough that I don’t want to eat even when I am hungry and wanting food. There’s no reason for me to be here since quite frankly it’s harming my mental health at the moment but Im a bit scared to go home. My parents have always been very strict (I’m 18 and still living at home) and they get very worried. I know going home right now while I’m barely completing wouldn’t necessarily be a great look. I told them before I left that I’d try at home to recover but I knew at that point I’d be going to res anyways so I might as well just go out with a bang. Right now it’s worth it to me to recover and eat at home so I can be home for the holidays and actually be there for college. I know that if I don’t recover, they will go to court for guardianship so I have a lot to lose and I have legitimate reason to try and get better. Two questions: the first, is recovery at home possible? And the second, how do I convince my parents I’m actually dedicated this time?"

im pretty sure it was below maintenance but since i couldnt purge all of it the 'typical' way; ive started working out more again, sp for the last hour or so i was working out, and the second i start too actually enjoy it and not only do it too feel ok after what i ate and less anxious. like i was kinda doing it cause it felt fun- i start feeling guilty becaude this should be for punishment & compensation- not for me too enjoy. so that sucks. now theres literally nothing i can do. ive been feeling guilty for sitting recently and found myself trying too always be moving. 

i cant watch things for long unless their related too ed's, food, weight loss, or i feel there a good use of my time (like they're beneficial too my ed) so not even that i can escape too which used too be the biggest coping thing for me. love that.

now i just feel guilty, sick from the food, and theres nothing too enjoy- but im still telling myself theres nothing actually wrong. someone fix my brain pls.

numbers, numbers, numbers

numbers on the scale

numbers on the very food i digest

numbers swirling around in my brain

—————————

they all add up

go smaller and smaller,

until eventually

they are no more. 

—————————

we all yearn for that day

when we stop counting,

when we finally drop dead on the floor

so deprived of the essentials of life

—————————

finally at peace

not a worry about your body,

not a thought in sight 

—————————

oh how i yearn. 

but i continue to count

continue to starve

continue to binge

it all adds up



it all adds up until i can bear no longer

and i break down

into a thousand pieces

—————————

sometime after, i pick myself up

and again, i start counting

crunching the numbers

restarting the cycle

waiting for the endless misery to cease"

I told them the website but also said that I didn’t know if they would still be making them as I got these jeans about 4.5 years ago when I was a freshman in college.

this fucking guy could not let that go. he was like “they still fit?! it’s crazy that you’re still the same size. No freshman 15 for you! you should try them on every year to see if you can still fit into them, as just a challenge for yourself.” I’m assuming my face kinda looked like 😟 I had a mask on (obvi, like I wanna die but not from covid lol) but I have incredibly expressive eyebrows and the wife seemed really embarrassed and straight up told her husband to stop.

Now every single time I go to wear my jeans, I have this like irrational fear that they suddenly won’t fit. So thanks so much mr man for giving me a wonderful toxic game to play for years to come and a fear of a pair of jeans that make my ass look great :("

What do I do?,7,3,1638600607.0,"I spent my childhood with my cousin and we were best friends. For at least the last 10 years, she has been suffering from anorexia: I can recall her being kept at home and occasionally is the hospital with my family taking care of her younger sister as her parents were trying to find a way to fix things (she was probably 9 or so at this time). As time went on, she slowly got worse. She is now 21. During high school, she was a very reputable track runner and cross country runner, well known in school and across the state. She got a full ride scholarship to college and everything. Once, before a race, she didn’t eat anything and got her best time ever. From then on, she wouldn’t eat before races. After high school, things really started going downhill. And now that  the pandemic has been happening, she has gotten absolutely horrible— and it has yet to stop getting worse. There’s so many little things that she has done to avoid eating: feeding food to the dog, saving food in her mouth and flushing it, spitting food out discreetly, things like that. She also does everything in her power to exercise, still. Sometimes when we have family parties, she bargains with her family to be able to go by saying she will eat when she’s at the house. But when she comes, she finds any excuse to go up and down the stairs, walk around, play with the dog. Absolutely any physical activity she can do, she will find a way to do it. During COVID, her parents didn’t want to put her into the hospital because they wouldn’t be able to see her. Now, they still haven’t admitted her. She has been in the hospital before, but she tries to bargain to avoid the hospital now. Their family has closed off to ours in a lot of ways, and we don’t fully understand why they won’t put her in the hospital. We know that they don’t want to stress her out too much (she’s at the point where too much stress can kill her), and it’s an emotional toll for them both for her to be in the hospital, but what they’ve been doing at home is simply not working. I saw her a few times in the last few months, and thought “if she gets any worse, she’s going to die.” All of my family is concerned, and my dad who is a nurse in the psychiatric field has tried to intervene and speak with her parents. He has offered to drive her hours away just so she can get the best help possible and her parents can ride in the back with her. In fact, they planned to have an intervention with her present and take her to that hospital the same day, but she convinced her parents not to take her by saying she would drop out of school to focus on recovery. She did drop out of school, but she has only gotten worse, and a lot faster than before. I just saw her last week for thanksgiving and I was appalled that she could have even gotten worse than she was before. TW/imagery: Her eyes are sunken in— she has the “horse face”— and it’s worse than the typical google search result. She has to wear gloves to keep warm, even back in the summer. Her hair is so thin and she’s beginning to lose even more of it. Her legs are and have been so skinny that it’s crazy to think that she was such a star runner before. After seeing her like this, I feel like I have to do something. I have no idea how to approach this, though. We used to be best friends, and now we occasionally text to say happy birthday, thanksgiving, etc. I want to find a way to both work with the parents and address the issue directly to her as I never have said anything about it to them/her. Should I work with my dad to figure something out? Should we talk to her parents again? Should I only message her? And if I do, how should I go about it? I don’t have experience with this and I’m afraid that I will say the wrong thing."

I didn't think it was enough of an issue to warrant treatment, mostly because my BMI is normal... but I figured I should just do it. So I could prove to my family that it's not an issue. 

During my consult, the therapist said that it's common for people with anorexia to not seek help because they don't think they're sick enough, and that *BMI is not only inaccurate*, but it's potentially dangerous because it **stops people from seeking help.** I guess I was one of them because she wants me to do IOP.  

The consult was pretty scary because I didn't realize that things were that bad. I knew hair loss and changes in/loss of menstruation were signs that something is wrong but I figured it was unrelated because... again, BMI is normal. 

I wanted to post this here because I had no idea that the BMI chart was THAT off, or that a person could be malnourished enough to start losing their hair but still be a ""normal weight"" for their height... and maybe someone else didn't know either. 

TL;DR: Your BMI doesn't really matter, if you don't eat you're probably malnourished and if you're struggling with eating you should get help. Don't wait until you think you're sick enough. Also if your hair is falling out that's probably a sign that you should get help. 

P.S. Throwaway account.

restricted this week successfully after not rly doing it 'good' for a few weeks & gained weight too a number i was uncomfortable with. 
diddnt weigh for a few days whilst restricting bc i had not enough time in schedule too weigh how i need too like before hand so wasnt sure how much/ if i lost/ gained. 
but felt like i was eating unsafe/ too much during those days even though i was tracking & was restricting. was halve sure i gained and halve sure i lost. but just begging too just b under what i considered uncomfortable / dangerous weight. 

so today when i could finally i did and was relieved & elated too see i lost way more than i thought i did. - too a num ive not been in a month or so. 
then i seem too always fall back into a pattern of when i loose weight part of me thinks its ok too eat so i fucking did & i ate mainly chocolate and crap. 

restricted in a sense but stopped tracking cals after abit but im sure it was around my maintenance ?  

spent the rest of the day every time after eating resetting my fucking fasting timer & then after the initial freak out & guilt of what i just ate went away id eat again and reset again. 

cried basically the whole afternoon and night lol and tried too excersize abit but just too tired too !! (so now i feel like a fake and guilty coz i cant even compensate good enough ha) & used unhealthy coping mechanisms after but now im just lying here 10pm tears sticking too my face feeling like such a faliure sad little piece of crap ha bcos not only did i unsuccessfully purge, excersize &  restrict. 

im paranoid & sad af that tomorrow when i weigh i will have gained and that number will be further away again & ill be forever stuck in a cycle of reaching a gw, giving in & eating, loosing control & gaining & then spendjng weeks just trying to get back control & too a manageable comfortable weight. 

i feel like ive ruined everything and my body will just balloon overnight. 
 like all these cals will turn too fat since i'm just lying here in bed not utilising it for energy. 

i feel too guilty too sleep but i'm tired af and too tired too workout which makes me feel guilty clz if i was rly unwell i would do it regardless until it felt safe too stop. 

so nlw im just lying here dreading the weight gain of tomorrow and having too look in the mirror back too square one. 

is this even a normal ed thought pattern. is  anything even wrong. this is fkn horrible. will i gain? is it possible since it was cal dense and right before sleep. my heads going to explode and i just want to bloody sleep.

does anyone else find them selves harshly judging others even though you disagree with the thoughts
. 
ive just started university & my old friends were aware of my struggles, i diddnt feel much of a competition among them because no one else really seemed/ told me they had struggled with it too. 
it sounds bad but it was 'my thing' yk. 

since starting uni in sept things have been getting worse, & they are much much worse than how i was when i left my old friends in school in june.

now im in uni and made new friends, none of them rly know and ive not directly made any suggestions towards having an ed. but if you knew i struggled w it and observed me my behaviours r clearly disordered lol.  
 
anways yday me and 2 of my friends were talking about r certain topics and sharing some things related, and one of them briefly mentioned they once dealt with an ed & body dysmorphia, nothing more than that, literally just saying those words. 
and oh my god has it sent me running back into restriction. 

and then all these shitty thoughts towards them starts. tbh i wouldnt have guessed or thought they had struggled, theyve never displayed any thing concerning and believe me, i have been observing the shit out of my friends at lunch and the way they talk ab food ha. for no reason i think its just an ed thing we do w most ppl. so i would have never guessed bcoz they seem too have a great relationship w food etc. 
So in my brain the way they said it made it seem like they had had an issue with food/ or body image but were just labelling it as an ed.  

i feel so guilty like im trying to invalidate them cause they seem fine and like if they had rly dealt w an ed they wouldnt have said it like that. 
but ofc i dont rly want to invalidate anyone coz ik that eds are so mental. but its just really really got too me.

i think what i rly am upset by is that i just feel like they threw the word around, and that she just brushed over it like they were a simple struggle and now theyre just absolutely fine and recovered. 
when i know how fucking torturous they are & feel so misunderstood in this illness.
 i never feel like i can talk about it w ANY of my friends unless i know exactly what too say and what topics im going too cover because i just want them too understand!! and too paint the right picture. i feel so protective over it and now so so competitive like i have too prove w out saying anything that i've 'actually struggled' w an ed. 

even though the person is lovely & would never try too upset me or feel competitive w this, i feel such a need too prove myself and restrict better bcos i 'actually struggle' but also am trying too look as normal as possible. i said nothing after so they dont know but idk i just feel so bad for invalidating them sm just about appearance and from what ive seen them do. 

i hate this so much but am also weirdly grateful it happened bcos its pushed me deeper into my ed and is just fuelling it so much."

Boy = body checker 
Girl #1 and Girl #2 (just two friends who he mostly body checks with) 

So this irl of mine ALWAYS does body checks, and I find it super weird as they’re literally body checks on the females in our group. I don’t know how to explain it but I’ve already deduced he’s not doing it for perverted reasons or to make us insecure, he doesn’t even know what he’s doing. 

For examples, he wraps his hands around our wrists and sees the smallest he can go, he’s gotten a hair tie and seen how far it can go up girl #2’s arm (spoiler she’s underweight and it went all the way up)

He does common body checks etc etc I see you know the point. Except now, I’ve gotten scared. He always seems to pick on me. In a light hearted sense? He’d never outwardly body shame me but refers to me as thick or the thickest which makes me super uncomfortable and confused as I’m not even close to being the fattest in the group.

He was saying how thicc girl #1’s thighs where today even though she is underweight and has a thigh gap. He was apparently ranking people on how thick they are? He’s weird. But I know my legs are far thicker than both the girls. I just can’t do this anymore, I can’t feel like such shit and get broken down any more by a stupid joke. 

I feel ashamed to say this I feel gross even acknowledging I’ve been referred to as a bigger person by him. I’m scared I’ll feel even more insecure and ridiculed when he measures how “thick” my thighs are next. I can’t deal with that, I know I am the fattest next to my thinspo friends and don’t want to hear it."

I felt untouchable for the longest time- like my youth would keep me safe from any of the harmful effects that I was warned about. while i wasn't exactly comfortable at a lower weight before, the discomfort was bearable... I'm sure most of you understand to some degree what I mean by that. the disorder warps our brains into believing that misery is akin to success.

well, that was all until my recent spiral. i was doing okay for a little while when I found some fulfillment in post-secondary. ever since I finished up my program this past summer I have been in pretty rough shape. i had an internship that I barely survived because I was engaging in my disorder so severely. Once I wrapped that up at the end of summer, I had nothing left to do and I started to hyperfocus on the illness even more. things are starting to get scary for me on a physical level and i don't know what i will do. somehow i got under my lowest weight. time seems to have flown by.

I've lost my period for the first time ever. my thick wavy hair is falling out and changing texture. i have white hairs all over me and skin issues (dry skin and acne). my hands and feet swell easily. I am covered in bruises. any scratch i get takes forever to heal. my body temperature is dysregulated- I'm either freezing or I get hot flashes. chronic pain in my hip/shoulder is worse than ever before. emotionally, i feel awful; i am so depressed all the time... a shell of the person I was even a few months ago. i cannot motivate myself to do anything for self-care most days.

i do eat. every single day. that's the thing that's worrying me the most... how can i possibly feel this bad when I'm still putting the effort into giving my body food? sometimes i feel even worse when I eat because of stomach discomfort. i no longer engage in certain purging behaviours but the IBS flares that I get from restriction make me so desperate sometimes that I am tempted to reach for ""ol' reliable."" 

y'all... i am really scared. i don't want to die. sure, my life is miserable right now and there are many things about it that I wish had an easy fix, but I don't want this disorder to kill me in the meantime... i struggle with suicidal ideation a lot but i do not feel like i am actively at risk of acting on it. with that being said, i have ghosted my doctor at this point because she is pressing the issue of recovery to me. me and my therapist are ending our work together in a few months because she is retiring to a new career. i don't feel like i am sick enough to need help still, even though i am sicker than i ever have been. 

i am 27 now and i know that i am getting too old to be ""comfortable"" with the disorder. i don't know how to want better for myself, though. i don't know if i even believe that ""better"" is possible. I'm just tired. i wish i could go to sleep and wake up in a new life."

Im gonna leave them mostly anonymous, but I’d like to know how I should go about helping them in a non-intrusive manner. I’m always there for them to talk to, and I think that helps them a great deal. But my only real advice up to this point has been “go to the doctor”, which they have said the want to, but are too afraid to do.

But with every snack she has with me, she takes only a bite and leaves everything else to me when we are out.
Once we went out and I agreed to eat since she is wants to eat something and got a sandwich, while I'm having my portion (Only meal of the day) she took few bites of her own portion and gave everything else for me to compleate it. 
I really have problems with wasting food. I just can't throw it away at all and feel like it's my responsibility to complete everything in my plate. I only have portions of food in my plate which I can complete.
I have suggested her to takeaway which she declined since it is just a small leftover. I couldn't say no and had to complete it only for me to go home and cry.

Ok... Im being forced to do it, but I want to recover as well. I want to enjoy life. After one hell of a journey I didn't lose just weight. I lost my life, and I want it back. Today, 29th of November I decided to recover. I'm going to take little steps, but hopefully it will be worth it :) 

Weight gain is still so fcking scary but I can do it right? I'm going to start today, and for dinner today I'm going to have *PASTA*!!!! PASTA!!!! Im so frickin excited :) I'm already happier with life and now when I look in the pantry, I'm actually excited to eat what's in it !!!

 Tomorrow breakfast will be tough. My nutricionist and I decided on a meal plan that can make me stop losing weight so quickly, and then we will focus on the **weight gain**... Kinda nervous. Not kinda. Very. Very nervous. tomorrow morning I'll have yogurt for the first time for such a long time <3333 WITH GRANOLA!!!!! I'm so happy I'm going to start to enjoy life again without worrying about numbers!!!!! 

I want to fully recover. I want to stop looking at food like they're just numbers. I want to enjoy cake without wanting to kill myself after I eat it. I want to have lunch and dinner with my family and have them not worry about me anymore. I want to be free from this monster that anorexia is. I truly hope that all of you will have this help that I received and made me realize that my life is more important than a number on a scale. Than a size. Than a flat stomach. 

I have so much more to say <3 Im so happy I feel like a giant weight has been lifted of my shoulders! Of course, I'm still struggling with my self esteem and stuff like that. But maybe it will get better :) It will be the best thing ever not to worry my parents anymore :) 

I'm daydreaming about eating at restaurants and now caring about calories! I will try to avoid looking at the calories in the back of the food and actually enjoy it. 

If I can do this, you can too. Its gonna be a looooong journey rough journey and it will take time to fully heal. Reddit and this sub have been a really important coping mechanism for me and helped a lot when I felt guilty for eating. There's a lot of kind, sweet people here. And I genuinely hope those people can find the will to get healthy and happy again :) 

Im literally so fucking excited to eat dinner today. And breakfast tomorrow. And an afternoon SNACK 😋😋😋😋 omg im so excited wtf why am i so excited!!!!! Maybe someday I'll be eating PAIN AU CHOCOLAT WITHOUT CARING ABOUT ALL THE MACROS AND CALORIES THAT WOULD BE LITERALLY A DREAM. IMAGINE EATING DESSERT WITHOUT GUILT. IMAGINE EATING WITHOUT GUILT!!!! IM SO HAPPY IDK WHY
!!!!! I HOPE THIS FEELING WILL LAST FOREVER AND I DONT CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT RECOVERING :D

one of the reasons why i am making this post is to remember the reasons why i wanna recover and so i don't change my mind :)

Im kinda scared because im scared i might lose control... But i have to trust myself right? Yea. I'm gonna be healthy again and take control over my life. thank you all so much for everything ❤️

sending love for everyone 🙂💖
thank you again."

A ton of adrenaline, exercise was something I craved and had boundless energy for and honestly I felt “high” a lot of the time and not eating much or preoccupied at all by food.


Fast forward to now and sex feels like an absolute chore and I have like no appetite for it, but it’s nothing to do with my boyfriend. It’s just…. I don’t care or really want it. Restricting is hard now and I crave food every minute and my exercise routine is something I am an absolute slave to vs something I want.

I mean, I think I know the answer but… can anyone relate to any of this???"

The muscles in my throat would stop mid swallow or not activate at all when I was done chewing. Along with restricting I purged. 
It doesn't happen all the time, it seems to come in waves with varying degrees but every time it happens it gets worse and takes longer to finally swallow the food. I work in a hospital and finally brought it up to a couple of the nurses I trust and one of my bosses. Mostly because I'm so scared of  choking alone as it's getting worse. They told me I need to get a referral from my PCP and see a GI doctor. My husband and I don't have any money at all. I struggle still with my EDs still especially now that I've been stuck overweight since I had my child 3 years ago. 
I used to think nothing was ever actually going to happen to my body, sure other people. But not me. Yet here I am, 25 with the possibility of having damaged my throat to the point I could need a feeding tube sooner rather than later in life.

if you would have asked or observed me the way i see myself two-three weeks ago, it was clear i have an ed. ive been struggling for just over a yr now, and since September this yr just going between feeling in the depths of my ed & heavily restriction, too feeling alright with my food, body & life. Therefor not feeling the need to cope with restriction or engaging in ed behaviours as much. 

within weeks of eachother
i feel like ive just been in a cycle of severely restricting;feeling the worst i have mentally and physically. Too not having as many thoughts 
or at least ignoring them more & eating fairly normally. And being able too eat more without guilt and feeling genuinely okay/contempt for a few days. 

feel i came out of a very depressive slump Throughout the last 2 weeks, during which i was restricting & engaging in many disordered behaviours, then last week during trying to restrict i could feel my mood & depressive state starting to lift & found it easier too eat etc, found myself justifying it being ok too eat instead of the opposite. 
but then engaging alot in purging too compensate. 

since about friday last week i've been eating basically normally, not rly restricting & not purging in any way & only engaging in a few behaviours (like timings, eating w certain utensils, kcal checking) mostly without even realising. which tbh i am glad about bcos otherwise id feel way too uncomfortable feeling and acting so 'normal' so quick. i did become vegan in sept 2 make restr/ less stressful. And ive not really been listening or heard the ed voice as much.

Which makes me think I have just been putting everything on. like i have chose in the past too push this voice more & more in my head or am really just telling myself these things. 
I partly know this isnt true and what i've felt in the past was valid and real. but i just dont understand how i now i can so easily 'decide' too eat normally & use less behaviours. feel less scrutinising of my body and stopping to weigh myself as much.

I feel uncomfortable that i feel so normal & okay. 
I do in general find it hard too accept feeling happy; prefering the comfort of depression- using this too fuel my ed. but since my mood/ mental state has improved it just feels easier too eat. 

im comforted by the fact that i'm sure by the end of this week ill sort of 'snap out of it' i guess. & realise what ive been doing & all the guilt will sort of catch up too me. but also afraid that it wont and ill just have made the quickest ed recovery in mankind. 

like this is just such an uncomfortable position it feels. i'm not actively trying to recover but also not engaging as much in ed behaviours and eating normally. i'm sure when my mood dips again ill go back too restricting but i feel so guilty, like i was able too take a 'break' from my ed as soon as my mood improved. and therefor it was never there in the first place. 

i always feel like as long as i feel my behaviour/ eating is disordered then i'm okay. the only reason ive been okay with eating normally since friday with no compensatory behaviours is that i've been telling myself its a binge. when i know its not but feeling/acting normal is just too much too accept.  

was any of what i felt in the past even valid then, too have said i had an ed?
I feel like such a liar, as if i would just push myself to feel worse too benefit my ed. 
does anyone else ever go through phases like this. 
Is it normal with an ed. ik that the part of me trying too grasp on too what ed behaviours i have still been using is in itself disordered but i feel like the only person whos ever done this and been able too have consecutive days like this. i feel like ive been faking all along. and ik i wasnt so maybe i just was never as bad as i thought. i dont know. maybe when my mood drops again ill realise what i've done and itll all come crashing down lol. 

tysm for reading ik it was long af- i just need help.  

stay safe:)"

she's vegetarian and lactose intolerant, so a bunch of what she eats is inadvertently vegan. i personally don't eat meat very often, don't eat any red meat, and especially don't make any at home, but i'm not vegetarian - when we eat out there's like a 50% chance i'm getting something with chicken. this results in, nine times out of ten, the dish she's getting being less calories than the one i want to get

sometimes i get what i want anyway, but end up feeling terrible about it. most of the time i get what she's getting. ie. i love falafel, and sometimes am actually craving falafel, but sometimes i really want chicken shawarma and am too terrified to get it - even though before we moved in with each other it was actually one of my safe foods. it doesn't help that she's way shorter than me, gets full really quickly and usually has to take home leftovers

i live in ontario (we have a law that restaurants MUST put the calories of their dishes on every menu 🤗 goody) so there's no way to avoid checking at the calories :( what would be a good strategy to deal with this?"

Now I'm not going to go in detail in what I've done in attempt to lose weight but basically I've lost zero weight and I mean zero but I look skinner but in exchange I'm super weak I used to be able to lift 20 pounds and curl them in sixth grade well guess what, now I can't lift 12 pounds without trying my hardest, and I don't look that skinner like no one has noticed anything. So this just goes to show you that weird side effects happen like I'm constantly cold and my skin on my arms are cracked. And I kept denying that I'm anorexic but I saw this thing on tv where these people were starved and I thought ""they don't look that skinny"" but then I looked in the mirror later that day and saw my arms and was like ""Oh shit"".                               But anyway way how can I gain the muscle on my arms back without lifting weights (Because my arms keep popping when I do that?)

My jaw will be wired for 3 weeks (assuming there are no complications that require a longer wiring). There’s only one problem with this though.. judging by where I’m posting, you know what it is. I am underweight and being on a liquid diet for 3 weeks will worsen the problem to a degree that my parents have started to mention me getting a feeding tube if I lose too much weight. Given my typical my rampant excuses to restrict as much as possible whenever I have the opportunity (which will be plentiful given my post-surgery state), I have no doubt that the aftermath of my wiring will be severe. Those of you who have gotten a feeding tube (NG, NJ, PEG, etc. any info helps), what is it like to have one? Are you allowed to set parameters of how much is administered to you?

Also, I am not sure why, but my parents have primarily mentioned a PEG (the one that is basically permanent and goes in via the torso). I don’t know if a doctor would go that route first when a feeding tube is first established as necessary, though. I assumed that, unless I was too swollen to have a nasal-based tube, the worst that could happen was an NG or NJ for a week or two, not something so permanent. Either way, I’m scared out of my mind.

I convinced myself that my past severe restriction wasn’t even a disorder because I wasn’t fucking exercising at that point. 

Two days ago I was finally acknowledging the way that my entire life is consumed by weight and food again and that yeah all these physical and mental symptoms are not normal or okay and that feeling so miserable and trapped isn’t either and I decided I would try and get better.

I let myself have one untracked day yesterday for my 18th birthday because I spent days crying about not being able to eat cake (which sounds so dumb) and god it felt so good to just eat something other than the same 3 things I’ve been eating every day for months. It was so uncomfortable to be full but I tried really hard to not overdo it because I didn’t want to make myself sick but I think that made it worse for me mentally. I felt and still feel guilty for not feeling as bad about it as I should have. 

I woke up so depressed today after having such a nice day and just eating really nice stuff because I feel like the fact that I was able to do it means I was never sick to begin with and I’m back at square one. It sounds so stupid but after eating more for even one day I felt like I was thinking so clearly and I made an appointment with my fucking GP to talk to her about what to do from here because I’d decided that my gift to myself would be a commitment to try and recover but now I’m back at ‘Recover? From what? You’re fine’. I’m such an idiot and now I just want to fast until the appointment because there’s no way she’d take me seriously like this."

What I’m curious is, how bad is it to cut food out for days, I haven’t been an anorexic for long at all, but when I do starve, I’ll go a day or even 2 days not eating a single thing, not a nibble, not one bite, nothing, so how bad is that really, I don’t want to be hospitalized, I just want to cope and starving is helping a little bit."

It’s on the second floor and there are no windows, so it was literally hot enough to have sweat dripping down my forehead in the time it took me to pee as quickly as possible. That obviously sucked, but it made it so I could shower like a person. My thermostat is in the coolest room in the house and said it was 29°, so the bathroom had to have been like 33° at least. It made it so I wasn’t too cold when I got out of the shower. 

My bathroom is obviously not 33° anymore, it’s probably about what the thermostat says: 23°. I can’t keep it any warmer because my bedroom is a small, carpeted room while the rest of the flat is open with hardwood floors and I can’t turn off just the bedroom radiator. Showering, or more specifically getting out of the shower, is unbearable. We're talking violently shivering in the fetal position with a blanket, right next to the radiator in the bedroom if I can make it there, with purple lips. I shiver so hard it makes my muscles sore for hours or occasionally into the next day. At this point, as dumb as it sounds, I'm terrified to shower or take a bath. I'm deadass out here washing my armpits and genital area with a soapy washcloth. 

I want to shower, but even thinking about it makes all of my muscles tense up and my brain pretty much won't let me. If I tell myself I won't watch tv or work on whatever craft or some shit until I've showered, I'll end up sitting for hours doing literally nothing because overcoming my aversion to it is so difficult. I want to be properly clean. Right now I'm only showering properly like once a week! My brain is out here acting like I'll die if a take a shower! Like yeah I get ridiculously cold but it only sucks for like 20 minutes. Last winter I could pretty well handle washing my body in the bath and washing my hair separately by just leaning into the running tub water when I was dressed and dry, but that's too cold now too. I'm not *that* much thinner, so like, why the fuck?

I had a moment when looking at a picture of a girl who was supposedly my height and weight but seemed much bigger than me when I realized: I don’t even know if I can trust my own reflection. I doubt I look like how I perceive myself to look. It’s just sucking the life out of me tonight because I’m afraid that I’m much bigger and thus more unattractive than I thought. I’m scared that treatment brainwashed me to love a body that isn’t meant to be loved.

I just want to relapse so I can be better looking again."
