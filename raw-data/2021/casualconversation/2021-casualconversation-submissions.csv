rt02s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/rt02s5/an_introvert_in_a_family_of_extroverts/,An Introvert In a Family of Extroverts..,1,2,1640975218.0,"On good thing of lockdown was, making me realize how introverted and overthinker i am, It help me to understand myself better. Everything i do makes sense now.

It also made me realize that no one in my family is as introverted as me, not even my friends or anyone in my family. Thanks to the internet i realized, it's not only me, there are also people out there like me, I'm no longer the odd one out.

Like now, everyone is sitting outside Talking, chatting, Laughing but I'm sitting inside alone. I don't feel bad about sitting alone, but i do feel bad that i'm not celebrating with everyone. it's not like i don't like to hangout with my relatives, but i don't have the energy to smile when everybody does, or listen to people talk attentively, i'm tired, i want to be alone, doing things i like to do,alone.

I'm not saying I like to be alone all time, every human beings need social interactions multiple times a day,after all humans are social beings, i just value my alone time and prefer to be alone, even i sometimes want to meet & talk people...

My main point was, I request all people to share their stories,akward moments as an Introvert,Over thinker, and also as a shy person,I'm not forcing anyone but...I don't want to feel if I'm the only on experiencing this. I'll just make my day happier."

I'm not in it, nor am I interested in joining it. My aunt has created a second group chat for unknown reasons, and I want to leave it. Problem is, if I leave then everyone sees that I left and it's gonna make things very awkward the next time we meet in a family gathering. I don't want everyone to shower my inbox with unimportant texts. The best idea I can think of is silencing the group and turning off notifications from it, but I don't know if it'll be enough. Do you guys have a family group chat that is full of texts you have no interest in getting?"

How some have already welcomed the new year and did it in different ways. In my country, it's with fireworks, loud music, and vehicle horns. Others are still preparing for NYE.

But when yesterday a friend of mine started randomly singing and i asked what song that was, he was flabberghasted, and asked me: ""dude, it's starway to heaven. You never heard of it?"".

And at that moment we both realized that for more than 20+ years i listened and was aware of ONLY the ""Starway to heaven"" famous intro. AND THAT'S IT.

What should i do? Should i listen to the whole song? Should i record myself doing it? I don't know.

EDIT: I decided im gonna listen to it within 48 hours, and i'll say my opinion then.

I was never close to my family, and never really felt nostalgic about home in the last 3 years I’ve been here. I didn’t know what homesickness felt like.

It’s New Year’s today, midnight struck less than an hour ago. We’re spending New Year’s quietly at home today like last year, as partner’s family doesn’t have a thing for celebrating New Years (I would normally visit family at this time, but with covid I haven’t been able to). I went downstairs to wish partner’s family happy New Year’s, but found out they all already went to bed. 

My family usually does a Christmas/New Year’s party with the extended family (I should say, a numerous one), with a massive feast, games and backyard fireworks. I don’t do well with big gatherings and loud noises, so I didn’t think much of them at the time. But now that I’m sitting alone in my room, hearing fireworks in the distance and neighbours’ celebrating… I kind of miss them. For the first time, I’m feeling homesick.

How have your New Year’s been since covid? Did you have to leave some long lived traditions behind like I did?

My own partner can't stop listening to something or another first thing in the morning when they open their eyes. Meanwhile everyone looks at me like a weirdo because I like to walk our dog without listening to music or sometimes chill at home and clean without spotify playing thru Alexa, or drive around in my car in silence. I will admit that even I will have some days where I'm watching YouTube while brushing my teeth but i can limit myelf; 5mins of silence 2x a day when brushing my teeth is something I've learnt to incorporate into my daily routine.

Imo silence is meditative in a way. People should do it more. Just my 2 cents."

I'm going to see Resurrections today, and I've heard that it's not very good, but I don't care. I'm just excited to see a Matrix movie on the big screen.


Update: just got out of the theater and it was so good! The writing wasn't great, and I don't think they managed to justify the film's existence in the plot, but honestly, it doesn't really matter to me. The movie looked amazing, and I'm really happy I finally got to see a Matrix on the big screen. The actors did an amazing job and I almost burst into tears whenever the leads were onscreen together. I get why the reviews are mixed, but I had a great time."

So, I'll be spending a quaint evening, order some delicious pizza, maybe watch a movie and get some rest instead of starting 2022 hungover. But I'm a bit afraid of feeling lonely, since I'm just starting over on the whole ""Feeling good by myself"" thing. What are your plans?"

Here in the Philippines, there are a lot of superstitions regarding the new year and most of it focuses on bringing wealth/luck.

Most people would gather round fruits. I don't exactly know how many kinds. Some people say 8, others say 12. This is meant to bring good luck. (Round is shape of money/coin.)

Red fish. On the 31st is when the market prices on food products such as fish/seafood/fruits go up. This also symbolizes good luck.

No chicken. Chicken is bad luck since they say that the luck will fly away or something like that.

Throw a lot of coins within the house for good luck.

A lot of kids and probably a few adults jump when the clock strikes midnight. They say it makes one taller. Lol.

Make noise to drive bad luck/evil away. Either firecrackers/fireworks, banging pots/pans, blow into a horn (usually kids), or even blowing the horn of one's vehicle. So it is really really noisy. I wonder if it's the same in your country.

Also, depending on where you live, streets will be filled with smoke after. A lot of delayed flights because of ""zero visibility"" due to smoke resulting from fireworks. 

So what's new year like in your country?

PS I won't be doing any of those."

1. Writing diary…

Diary: Here we go again, you write for two days and then doodle!

2. Working out…

Dumbbells: We’ve been here since 2017…at least clean the dust

3. Bakin-

Oven: Stop right there, you can’t even boil the water without burning the utensil

4. Reading…

Books: Yeah like one page everyday

5. Partying every month at least once

Money: Why does she even try saving?

Alcohol: YAAAAAAAS BTCH!!!!

\*Finishes listing the resolutions and forgets about them the next day\*

If you tell me that you followed and actually were able to complete your new year resolutions Imma say you lie! Why? Cause if you do you must be an angel out of this world.  
New year resolutions are meant to be forgotten…okay that’s a lame excuse. But that is exactly what happens, no matter if you are someone who remembers what happened, where to whom, how a decade ago; when it comes to remembering and religiously following new year resolutions your memory gets shorter than that of goldfish.  
Hey, if you are gonna shout at me for my laziness…in my defense it's WINTER! Besides no one wants to write in the journal that I was working at 11:50 pm on the 31st and got to know it's 2022 after hearing the firecrackers! Once I was so determined to follow my resolution of going on a diet I swear I tried to eat salad but it's not my fault that it comes with a pizza!  
Woh har new years pe extravagant new years’ resolutions banana jaroori hai kya? (Is it necessary to make extravagant resolutions in the new year?) Can’t our resolutions be as simple as looking out for ourselves, taking it slow, stopping multitasking, and being kind? Oh also drinking more water…(not a good idea in this chilly weather though).  
Despite complaining about not being consistent about my resolutions, it always feels exciting to look forward to something new, in the coming year. Cause even though we love the layers, we always wait for the snowflakes to wither and reveal the beautiful bloom of the mango tree. Yeah, my 2021 started off with a really bumpy start but hey, so what I wasn’t able to do the things I planned I still have next year, right!  
2022 be ready, here I come with a whole bunch of enthusiasm, loads of determination, passion, sprinkles of excitement, and a gist of positive vibes and kindness!  
This year I WILL BE dedicated to my new year's resolutions! First stop, working out every day!

\* First morning of the new year \*  
Dumbbells: Yeah… it's 11 am and she is still knocked out…

I always try to get a conversation going in good faith, I’m in no way a reactionary and immediately start shouting or labelling him as ignorant, but try to explain things in a collected manner. 

I’ve never been successful with that and am at the point were i cannot be bothered anymore. 
My dad’s really a stand up guy and I’ve never seen him treat anyone as a lesser person or something like that, but he still holds these backwards views on certain topics which are not only damaging to others, but himself as well. 

Sometimes i choose to ignore it or just say something like “it’s just a generational thing”, but that’s not really a solution that sits right with me. I’m sure a lot of you can relate and i am curious how y’all handle these situations"

We have different age cutoffs for different categories. For example, the legal drinking age is 20, driving is 16, and so forth.

I am constantly worried about catching it and passing it to other people so I started to isolate myself from everyone. I mean I haven’t travelled and I haven’t seen my family for two years! Mainly because they are out of the country, but still. I used to hate hugs, the feeling of other people’s chests touches mine makes me crawl, now I kinds of miss it ahhhh I am so weak!! I really miss the crowd, hugs and dining inside without the fear. Anyway I am just here to vent about covid, and I am sure everyone must be affected by it big or small.

As you can see I post alot of ""friendship."" Post because I originally joined this app for friends, as a last resort I researched apps to help make real friends and Reddit was one of the apps that came up that I hadn't previously used. So about a month ago, I started using it to make friends and only to make friends. But after being in the social, lonely, meet people, make friends reddits ive made zero friends. 

I've made post in hopes to make friends to meet in real life eventually, call on the phone, send each other stuff, watch stuff together, game together, FaceTime basically in a nutshell a real long term genuine friendship that can work through anything. I personally can't have friends irl where I live specifically, due to a domestic situation, so for 7 years ( since I was 11. ) I've been on social medias trying to make friends to meet in real life and have a real connection with, I've sent people things, been here for people, sent voice notes, stayed up with people, listened to people but all of them found other people, got in relationships and just left and would occasionally pop up to vent or ask for stuff and it sucks. 

I see so many people online say they're alone and want friends like me, but they don't. They just wanna be here and talk which I have nothing against, but when you have no real life interactions, youre just online everyday for 7 years and have no balance it gets old. And that's why I wanted real friends. To have the negative and positive stuff, and work through things together, and a relationship one day to have and watch each other grow and stuff, but it's hard when everyone who dms me is inappropriate, racist, bored, or using me to vent and have no interest in doing what I want to do in a friendship. 

I can't tell if I'm the problem, or whatever but yeah. I was told Reddit and insta and stuff aren't the places to go and try to find friends but Ive tried everywhere and it all just sucks. Sorry for the rant lmao, if anyone does see this and want to be what i mentioned you can dm me! Though i prefer people 17-20 and from the US. 


Enjoy your new year! Make it a good one >:)"

It wasn't a big deal. A person wanted to know what colors 2 belts were and what colors 2 different buckles were.

Is it weird to hear from someone you haven't spoken to in 25 years, since you were just children? We're both married with kids (according to her profile) and I've no interest in anything other than reconnecting. Wondering what others opinions are, perspectives.

rs490a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/rs490a/gayqueer_telepathy/,Gay/queer telepathy?,7,8,1640877856.0,"So, my brain felt so tired and just drained from work today. I usually don't go out much to save money but I decided to treat myself today and so I looked for cafe recommendation in my city that's ideally have a quite atmosphere/not too crowded.


To my surprise, there's a cat cafe in my city (there are cats there that you can pet) and I read the reviews and someone said when she went there no one was around so she had all the cat to herself. I prayed I have her luck haha. 


It was quiet when I arrived, just me and a couple however soon enough it became crowded as the place is small. There were me, three couples, and a family with two toddlers. I stayed there because.... Cats, duh! I wanna pet them and be around them, it's calming! And I did a little bit of work there too. 


Around an hour and a half before closing time, these two guys came. I immediately thought, they seem to be a couple. Of course I could be totally wrong but that's just how I felt. Soon after they arrived the family and the othe couples left. 


They seemed very comfortable with each other (in a positive way! There's just no awkwardness between them) and I was thinking, if only there's a way I can let them know that they're safe in front of me (it's illegal to be gay in my country) and they can act as a couple if they want to and I am queer too! But of course, I can't just approach strangers and be like hey yall queer? Cool me too anyway it's safe to be youraelf around me! Or maybe you can but im quite shy and generally a scaredy person. 


Anyway I nternally debated with myself whether to say something to them or approach them, but I was too shy, and of course, there's a chance I could be totally wrong. What if they're just besr buds lol. 


Anyway, I only said, hey, you guys can come here and pet this cat (which I have been petting throughout the evening, this cat seems to be one of the friendliest and one of the most fluffy too! I wanted to offer to take their pic together, but I chickened out. 


Anyway, I decided that the most supportive thing I can do is to probaby just leave, give em a bit of probably much needed alone time. However, as I was leaving the cafe, one of them said ""Hey, Ms!  take care!"" And I was so shocked and I just said thanks, you too! And I can't help but wonder if they knew I knew. 


Of course, I could be totally wrong and they're just being kind because of that small interraction about the cat. But I think they knew. Or maybe im just looking into things too much because im starved for social connections haha. 


But yeah anyway, this is such a long post for something so trivial, sorry I wasted a few precious minutes of your life to read this and have a good day/night :)"

I love people being passionate abt things just for the love of them and it brings me true joy. There’s tons of hobbies you would have never heard of or thought abt. The fact that there’s groups of people who are super into them, dedicate hours of their free time to, is inspiring. I think people focused too much on what people do for work, or how they can make money. I want to focus on what gives people genuine happiness and interest. 

Maybe it would detail the history of the hobby in depth and then do interviews with people who are deeply involved in the hobby. Idk man"

If you put up the flag, the mailperson will even take your letters away for you without visiting the community box or the post office! I thought it was a Hollywood film thing, like in Benchwarmers where they go out and bat the mailboxes. I've been to NYC and Philadelphia and never saw mailboxes at the end of lots. They do in Virginia, supposedly.

In urban Canada, the mailperson delivers to a rectangular box beside the door. Older homes may even still have mail slots in the door. If it's an apartment, they have a Master Key to open the multi-unit boxes and put the mail in where it needs to go. Some suburbs and rural areas have community boxes similar to the apartment multi-unit boxes, but outside with a delivery slot for mail to be picked up. The mailperson will only take Return to Sender mail from mailboxes. I think Canadians can't have them at the end of lots because of the snowplow. Does that mean then that Maine also does not have end-of-lot mailboxes?

In the U.K., apparently there are mailboxes with slots and a lock system. This is similar to Canadian boxes, but ours are not locked and it's a big pocket rather than a narrow slot.

Penn Badgleys character does not look anywhere near 18 and Heard and him have intense scenes of make out sessions. Can we stop the sexualization of teenagers?????

Be it a private citizen or a library, pubic or not, but we live in an age in which the information is taken for garanted, an we think we can always retrieve a piece of media, or if you prefer an information of any kind.

But my experience on the internet, and beyond, is quite different. Expired links, lost pages, lost books, damaged informations all over the place. Just now, i noticed a couple of books outside, rady to be destroyed in the reciclation process. Those were surprisingly interesting, although some of them are completely out of my usual field of interest and so on. One of them is a collection of papers about Caravaggio, with a personal note from the author itself to the one who was gifted it, a simple note but still...others were catalogue of different artists. But the list goes on, and it includes quite interesting documents, even an history book which is falling apart, but i can restore it. I would love to address them all, but i cannot in this space.

The fact, i know the people who decided to dispose of those books, and they are some of the nicest persons i ever met. I am genuinelly saying this, no malice was behind it, and it is partly my fault for not letting them know that i could be interested in books they would otherwise have to throw away. They had to free the house they are selling, so they had no alternative in the time, i guess. But, if you have the chance, always, always make sure those volumes won't go to waste. This is not meant to be an accusation, as i have stated they might have had to dispose of those items. If you can avoid that, you will make somebody else happy just as i am now for having saved those volumes. This is, indeed, an invitation. After all, we are impacting on this planet even by just being wasteful. I hope all of this text did not bore you, but i cannot make it any shorter. Edit: small typo within the first sentences."

Now that wouldn't be a problem if only I wasn't the only teenager there. I never cared enough to have good relations with them to be honest, but their children all go somewhere and I feel kinda embarrassed to be there alone.

Recently at a Christmas dinner my boyfriend and I met a someone's boyfriend who had no clue who Matt Damon was. We were talking about Spirit and were like ""oh yeah with Matt Damon"" and this guy (super nice!) had no idea who we were talking about. We then went through a bunch of his movies and he hadn't just not seen them but had also not heard of them either.

It seems pretty reasonable to not know who an actor is of course, but the more we talked about it later we were surprised at how many movies Matt Damon really has been in and wanted to know what others were thinking. Any thoughts? 

Here's a few lists of movies with Matt Damon in case you were wondering about how varied and popular his filmography is.

I spoke with the doctor about my various small health issues and she made suggestions and then I got my bloodwork results.  I was surprised when she told me that everything looked normal and some things like my cholesterol levels were surprisingly very good!

This was yesterday and today I feel like I've had a sudden epiphany.  Without going into too much details I've had a few rock bottoms during the past 10 years which led me down some dangerous paths, so I'm pleasantly surprised that my health is doing as well as it is.  So the test results made me take stock of other things in my life.  

I feel like being born mixed-race and LGBTQ+ into a military family had certain challenges and traumas that I've realized and begun to address only in the last few years.  My generation also faces a great deal of challenges with financial difficulties and political unrest.  Despite all of this I feel like I've made a great deal of progress in finding myself during my adult years and actualizing my identity.  I feel that because my mental health is doing fairly well now my physical health is doing better because I deal with challenges better than turning to harmful habits.

So I feel like I've won the great battle of being who I'm meant to be.  The rest is survival and unexpected challenges have to be faced as they come.  I feel powerful and victorious in my sense of self."

We were friends and had done a lot together, had lots of mutual friends, but soon she would head back to her country. What a fool I was, I sometimes thought, to not have kissed her. It would have almost certainly resulted in a very passionate night, and possibly many more. But I did nothing of the sort. Instead, weeks later, my best friend was dating her. They actually got pretty serious. But then she moved back home and their relationship died after many months. Now they don't talk. But me and her do, and I can sense a strong friendship that will last the ages.

They have no family here except for each other. We started dating earlier this year and I found out that other than a gift from his brother, he receives no Christmas presents and hasn’t really celebrated Christmas since he moved here. 

After he told me that, I made it my mission to make sure he had a great Christmas. I got him his first ever advent calendar that we opened together every night on FaceTime if we weren’t together. I bought us a gingerbread house to build. I got him fun stocking stuffers, presents to open between just us and some gifts to open when we visited my parents house. My brother and sister ended up getting him a little something as well. I made sure that whatever day that my family got together for Christmas worked for his schedule and I’ve planned to spend my entire holiday off of work with him. 

We got back to his apartment on Christmas after spending the day with my family and he gave me the biggest and longest hug ever. And then I realized he was crying. He told me he’s never had someone put so much effort into making sure he had a good day and it meant a lot to him. He’s pretty sentimental but I’ve never seen him cry. He made my heart melt and now I realize why it never worked with anyone else."

Of course, not many would put that information out about themselves.

Admitting you were the asshole in a situation is hard. Especially if you have only realised it in hindsight.

I have been the toxic person in my romantic relationships. In the moment, I have been able to rationalise poor choices where I fully convince myself I’m not in the wrong. When I felt most content, I would feel like something bad is coming, my own self sabotage. Picking fights, being stubborn, being inconsiderate. I never felt like I was doing any of these things intentionally, which was one of the ways I convinced myself I wasn’t doing anything wrong.

It became a vicious cycle for a long time until I eventually broke up with them because deep down I knew I was fucking up. My partner at the time wouldn’t want to break up, until months later the rose coloured glasses came off and they hated me. I think I wanted someone to love me even if I pushed them away, which is ridiculously flawed and cruel.

I’m in therapy now, have been for a year. Going through my behaviour and my family history made me understand why I did these things more. But it still baffles me that I’m even capable of being so horrible to someone I care for, for the sake of my own ego. I don’t want to be like that. I want to be kind.

I still feed off some drama but its only ever with my hurting myself now and I want to stop. For example, slept with a guy twice, didn’t really like him but then he ghosted me. I messaged him asking if he wanted to meet up and he declined. Which made me feel really drawn to him and really sad. I don’t want to continue this cycle of hurting myself or other people. 

I fully believe in myself with my friends, I deeply care for them and my actions show that. My toxic tendencies mainly just appear in romantic relationships and with my family.

Have you overcome any of your toxic behaviour, still working on it or perhaps just haven’t admitted it to yourself?

Any advice on bettering yourself?

Do you believe people can overcome their toxic behaviour?"

Pessimistic mindset is strong with this one.

Up till summer of 2014 when I was 24yo, I hoped that I would have two kids by 32. Now 31(m) no kids (still want to get married though). In that summer (when I go back from college) we discovered that my sister (29yo now) has a learning disability after she failed her 3rd semester in college. This made sense for why she struggled socially in communication and not bonding well with the family, along with anger issues, mood swings. Sometimes she acts like a 10yo and sometimes acts her age and she's aware that she has a learning disability but she only thinks it's related to studying, so do my parents.

She dropped from two colleges in the US and went back home and enrolled in an online college to avoid interaction with people since she had a bad experience with her roommates in her 2nd year due to lacking social skills. She graduated two years ago and struggling to find a job that suites her case because she doesn't want something that involves interaction with people and at the same time she would like it too. She can take care of herself, cook, order stuff, recently she learned driving and started going out by herself as long as there's another adult living with her and give her money.

Seeing my parents fail to deal with this issue over the years (when I see them inthe summer), my mom 62yo living in constant worries ""what's gonna happen to her after we are gone? ... if only she get a job I will be relieved"". Me seeing my sister in pain and can't comprehend why her life is not like the rest of people over the years, sensing my mom's worries when she randomly brings my sister's situation made me not want to be in her shoes at that age where she should be relaxing. I decided not to have kids to avoid seeing them suffer while I'm helpless which would cause me to suffer too. I failed to be a helping brother, how I could be a good dad?

Not to mention that over the years the sad stories related to kids that I heard like the Boston mom who committed suicide by driving into a lake along with her down syndrome 20yo boy because she couldn't take it anymore and was afraid of what's going to happen to him made my stand stronger. I can say that I'm not ready financially to make a family, but I know that's just a cover excuse for the real reason (I also going to take care of my sister financially after my parents). My other sister recently got married and already thinking of kids names and I'm like ""why I'm affected by sister case but it didn't affect her""

While good stories have no to so little effect to change my mind. Although my reason for wanting to have kids is for the social life aspect of it when I'm in my 50+, like the family gathering with grandparents. Even though this is one possible scenario that might not happen too for different reasons."

She was trying to reach the plates in the cupboard, but she was too short to get them, so she calls out “Tío [My Name], can you reach these plates?”

It was a simple thing, really, but it brought tears to my eyes to see her getting more comfortable with the family, and although she is not spanish herself, feels comfortable enough to call us that.

I have never been more enraged in my life these past 3-4 weeks. I have practiced touching my eye and applying my soft contact lens to my eye to no avail. I am comfortable touching my eye with little/no flinching; however, I find that my lens simply does not want to adhere to my eye, but instead sticks to my finger. I have followed the advice of having my finger dry so that the lens sticks to the eye; however, the lens still wants to stick to my finger rather than the eye. The adhesion between my lens and my finger is so great that I can shake my finger and hand and the lens stays fixed on the finger without falling off. How am I supposed to apply my contact lens if the lens literally sticks to my finger rather than the eye, to begin with? I have watched numerous youtube tutorials and have read other Reddit posts offering recommendations to no avail. Because I find applying directly on the brown part of the eye to be quite sensitive and painful, I have gone with the technique of trying to apply to the white part of the eye before looking and blinking to get the contact lens to fall in place. This method has been shown as working perfectly in youtube tutorials, but I feel my lens does not hold its shape as well as others shown in the video. My lens is more gelatinous and deforms itself more when on my finger being applied than I feel the lens should, especially when watching tutorials where the lens stays perfectly in its circular shape through the application process.

&#x200B;

Another issue I have noticed is that my eye stings when the contact lens touches my eye. Though I do not care about this (Heck, I just want to get the lens on), I have been told that this is not normal and should not occur. I have assumed that the stinging and red eyes are just a normal part of getting used to the contact and saline solution, but it hasn't gotten any better the past two weeks of constant attempts at getting my lenses in the eye. What could be the cause of this stinging?

Now, unbelievably, I am finding myself running out of time to become proficient at putting my lenses on. I have college classes starting up on the 3rd and contact lenses will be essential for me to be able to focus without constant headaches caused by Anisometropia (which reduced my ability to focus the previous semester).

&#x200B;

I feel I need a 100% foolproof technique to get these contact lenses in. Or alternatively, I am wondering how I can get access to Proparacaine Eyedrops or Anaesthetic Eyedrops. These would remove the pain in my eye so I can be more forceful in my application and even use multiple fingers to really get the lens smoothly on the eye. Are Proparacaine Eyedrops, or something like them, sold over-the-counter, or do I have to convince an ophthalmologist or optician to prescribe them to me.

&#x200B;

Please Help! Thank you!

Allergy test revealed a whole list: tomatoes, cantaloupe, cucumbers, watermelon, chestnuts and bees/wasps (a sting had sent me into anaphylaxis before so I already carried an epipen).

I now avoid those foods - including ketchup - just to be safe.

Which brings me to my current situation:

I received some new fancy shampoo for Christmas and went ahead and lathered up a few minutes ago.

Out of a somewhat shower boredom moment, I read the label to determine what made this so special - and unbeknownst to me - Avacado oil is an ingredient in said fancy shampoo.

I then rinsed vigorously and washed repeatedly with my old shampoo and read that label just to be sure: Coconut and Soybean oils. So there was never a danger there. 

Now I get to watch out for shampoo that might kill me.

Anyhow - so far so good - no reaction.

Her (F 17) and I had a really strong friendship that crumbled in a very dramatic and to be honest, heartbreaking fashion. It's a natural part of life to lose friends, but I'd say this one hurt a lot more than others. And for months, I spent a lot of my time lamenting what once was, what could've been (non - romantic), and what I could've done to preserve things.

But today, I had an epiphany, in some way, maybe it was meant to be that my former friend and I no longer communicate, regardless of how close we once were. For context, there was no toxicity or anything like that, for some reason, we just drifted apart. 

Regardless, if someone that I genuinely believed would be my friend long after graduating high school, is now just somebody I used to know, then maybe our friendship was never truly built to last. And while I've accepted things as they are for quite some time, it was this realization that gave one last dose of closure.

In the long run, it would've been pointless to try and preserve things. Because ultimately, we could say one way or another, the ship was gonna come crashing down. And again, there was no toxicity, or anything drastic, we just slowly stopped talking to one another. So, while my old friend and I are strangers to each other these days, at least there's some good, untainted memories and some newfound perspective.

Long story short, it's ok to let friendships end on their own, sometimes people just drift apart with no solid explanation, so there's little point in tearing yourself apart to preserve things. I get that relationships of any kind take some type of work, but ultimately, if keeping a friendship alive makes you more miserable than it does happy, than perhaps it's best to just let go."

Having this occur to me today made me wonder about what everyone else is reading right now, or the old favourites that have earned their place in the pile on the nightstand just by being re-read so often.

He had no recollection of sending them to himself and how they came in late at night. 

I told him he probably emailed himself and got drunk or it was him from the future trying to get in touch with him. 

He has a habit of leaving his computer on overnight so I couldn't resist hopping on. I scheduled an email to arrive the evening before it was going to rain and wrote, ""Make sure not to step in any puddles tomorrow."" Something innocuous, y'know? 

I think it's been a week and we were driving to lunch. He told me the phantoms were back and showed me the email. A miscommunication earlier made me think he had caught me so I owned up to it again, ""Yup, that one was me."" ""What?! How?""

Highlights:

\-He asked how I knew it was going to rain. He was absolutely amazed it rained after the email was received. Answer: weather app forecasting rain in a few days. 

\-He was disappointed that it wasn't his future self emailing him and he was wondering why he wasn't sending stock picks back.

\-I asked if he stepped in any puddles. He told me he wasn't going to answer that. He told a couple of his coworkers about his mysterious email and they told me he had been avoiding puddles like it was the nexus point for the worst timeline. 

He's still mad but I think this was worth ruining a work relationship for. Honestly, it's mostly on him for thinking his future self was emailing him. What is this, The Lake House?"

The first thing out of her mouth was “dude, did you hear about what happened to xyz?” And obviously I didn’t so I asked what happened. She said that at recess xyz got into an argument with a kid in a lower grade and they started shoving each other, but then they both just kinda walked away. Later at recess, xyz ran up behind the other kid and stabbed him in the neck with his pencil. Then he started choking him. The teachers broke them up and just sent the other kid to the nurse. I was like wtf?!??? Xyz was kinda weird anyways so it didn’t surprise me that much, but the biggest surprise was that he only got suspended for a couple days and nothing more.

A little about myself: At age 23 I have slightly over $87,000 CAD in savings and investments, and a few hundred dollars in credit card debt every month that I pay off at the end of each month. My current income is $45K-$50K a year. I keep my monthly expenses quite low, with the majority of my spending going towards buying groceries. I currently live with my parents to save money on rent and food. I have no other kind of debt at all, student, medical or vehicle, and my other assets are minimal so my net worth is essentially just my savings and investments, so slightly over $87,000. 

How about you?

It felt like walking in the middle of a Hallmark movie, except that I didn’t run into any eligible bachelors along the way.

I can’t see the shelf  very well while reaching, so I just feel for the cocoa powder canister and keep… reaching…. a little more…okay, I’ve got it! See, just because I’m petite doesn’t mean I need help all the time! 

Next moment I feel something hit my head hard. For a couple of seconds I’m dazed from the pain but then I look down and the aisle is absolutely covered in cocoa powder. My clothes are too. Turns out there was another container of cocoa powder on top of the one I blindly grabbed. Said container had been displaced, fallen right on my head, and busted open on the floor sending its contents all over the place. Some fellow customers are staring at me in disbelief and there’s a sort of chocolatey cloud in the air. 

Embarrassed, disgruntled, with my head still throbbing, I go find an employee and apologize profusely for the spilled cocoa. The employee is not at all amused by the whole business. But my family, upon hearing about the incident when I reach home, laughed for like 20 minutes. Especially my younger brother one of whose favorite pastimes is teasing me about my stature."

He does not have a whole lot in terms of education, and has always been 100% involved in his work, so he does not have a lot of hobbies or the like either. Lately he has said things that indicate he needs to do something, but does not quite know what. He has expressed interest in making videos on YouTube, without having any experience in video production or editing, or engaging in animation, without ever having drawn anything.

&#x200B;

I no longer live at home, and do not meet him that often, but I understand that he needs something interesting to do. The suggestions he has mentioned are not realistic for a well grown person to suddenly start with. I would have understood if he had mentioned them only as a pastime, because it can be fun to do video and animation just for fun, but he mentioned them specifically in a context of becoming ""popular"". I love my father and want the best for him, and do not want to hurt him, but I feel it would be wrong to encourage him to start something like this with the wrong starting point.

All in all, I'm wondering what I can recommend him to do so he can do something other than watch Netflix. There has to be some kind of interesting activities for an ordinary man in his 60s to start with?"

Christmas Eve night I could tell my bf was so excited to give me my gift because he kept asking if I wanted it now or later. I told him I wanted to wait until Christmas Day. He said at 12 it *would* be Christmas. Technically, yes. But I wanted to wait a little longer in the day, ya know? 

Anyway, 12 came. And he said he wanted to go ahead and give it to me. He told me as we were walking outside to go get it, “I want you to know how much I listen to you. It’s something you always wanted. Guess what it is. And really think about it first, something you always wanted.”

I really thought about it for a second, and there’s always been two things on my mind that I’ve always wanted as a kid and couldn’t afford to get. A trampoline and a four wheeler. So I asked, “a trampoline?”. His eyes lit up and he shook his head. I said, “No, you didn’t!” He just kept shaking his head as we were walking to his truck and got in to pull the box out. 

Talk about someone excited and speechless. I think that’s the most someone has ever given me for Christmas before. My twin was over for the holidays and put it up and jumped on it themselves a bit with me. It was like a present for us all.

A couple of nights in I drank a lot of tequila on an empty stomach into the early hours. I was up at about 6am for a white water rafting trip combined with a tourist bus across to the other side of the country. Obviously feeling grim. 

My next mistake was chugging a lot of tap water full of exotic bugs unfamiliar to my delicate English stomach. As the day wore on I felt worse and worse. Because I was feeling crap I didn’t really speak to anyone else on the bus, and in fact decided I didn’t like any of them (they were mostly loud excitable USA college kids who were probably great, but I just wasn’t in the mood). So as the afternoon wore on I sat there in the back seat feeling sorry for myself.

By about 6pm I realised I needed to be urgently sick and had to get the bus to stop. So I tapped the shoulders of the people in front, who must have been surprised to hear me talk. What happened next was a simple but wonderful exercise in human kindness. The message was quickly relayed to the driver, who stopped at a small roadside cafe, the owner of which quickly ushered me to the bathroom. 

Walking back to the bus 5 minutes later, seeing it lit up on the dark road side with all the tourists sitting there patiently waiting, filled me with so much gratitude. They and the cafe owner hadn’t really done all that much, but they’d seen a fellow human in distress and sprung into action to efficiently and kindly get done what was necessary to sort me out. I still remember it. 

Interesting footnote: feeling crap, I stayed an extra day in the next town. On that extra day I met a German girl also travelling solo. We had a holiday romance that turned into a long distance relationship, and eventually she moved in with me in London. We then split up almost immediately but she stayed in London, met someone else there and had a kid with him. That kid wouldn’t exist if I’d just bought a bottle of water rather than drinking the tap water!"

I also moved flats ninth times in seven years. 

I never planned this sort of life but whenever I try to stay still, life sends me on. I have no roots apart from my family home in the country where I grew up but I am sure that this is the only place where I do not want to live - although I spent here four months this year to recharge after finishing my masters. 

Now, I leave in 48 hours and instead of being recharged and confident since I should be basically a pro at moving to new places alone, I am only filled with anxiety and resentment. I am scared of what's ahead of me and the idea of knowing no one and struggling to get to know people. I always suffered from mild (social) anxiety but the pandemic just moved it to another level despite being in therapy and working a lot on my mental health. I am all familiar with these sorts of feelings before leaving for somewhere unknown for months, but they always take me aback by how intense they can become.

The older I get, the more I fear that I have no place in this world, and I am unable to put roots somewhere or create some meaningful connections. I have several very close friends but they are all around the world, none of them by my side. I've fixated lately on buying a property at some point soon to give me that base that I crave so much, but as doing the research, it seems impossible for a young person without a good financial background to do so. 

So with all those thoughts and feelings, I thought of posting here and asking - do you have any positive stories of starting over and over again? Different places, jobs, relationships? Funnily enough, I dislike beginnings and fear changes and yet I live this sort of life."

If there ever really was an interest, that is. 

It’s come as a somewhat ‘harsh’ reality. I had a feeling it would happen, but perhaps expected things to play out different. Combining this with the fatigue of the past year/two years/thought of the future, I feel completely lost. I’m exhausted with pretending to be happy and I’m exhausted with the daily routines that haven’t been broken up by proper holidays or ‘time outs’. 

It’s not as if things have been terrible. I have a stable job, people who care about me. Had some good times with said interest. I just feel I’m currently in a state of “now what?” 

I don’t feel particularly sad, I don’t feel angry. I don’t even feel ~disappointed. I just don’t feel anything. I have no interest in my favourite things, I can’t seem to focus. Just trying to keep busy. That said, I’ve made no attempt to do any for of socialising. I can’t bring myself to see people, even though I know that would be a great help. 

I suppose the purpose of this post is to get some general thoughts. What would you do in this situation? Have you experienced this yourself? How are you really feeling about everything the way it is at the moment? Whatever response comes to mind. Let me know."

I'm a shy guy with only one friend

This friend of mine is really special to me

We've been friends for two years

We last saw each other personally 1 and a half year ago, haven't seen her ever since

Our means of interaction is through online platforms as she's in abroad while I'm in the philippines

College has made it really hard for me to interact with her anymore as we are bombarded with academic works

For the past few months the only form of social interaction we've ever had was setting up watch parties in discord or google meet and after that we would stop talking for weeks until she invites me for another watch party

I haven't had any serious conversation with her for few months now and it scares me that we might be drifting apart

I basically don't know anything about her anymore yet I still try to open up about my life

She's my only friend whom I consider really close to my heart but I'm afraid that she doesn't consider me special as she has a lot of friends and I'm afraid that she might replace me or abandon me

What can I do to improve this deteriorating friendship

When the time comes when I'll finally see her face to face again, what should I do?"

But where I live it's popular to have a fancy shaped tombstone and your picture on it for others to look at and remember you etc. 

And now do you know the feeling when you need to get a picture for your ID, driving license, visa or any other document and it turns out so fcking awful you just want to never look at it? And are embarassed every time you need to show that document to someone? FOR YEARS, until you need to change your document and get a new photo that also looks awful? 

So I was thinking... what if these people who have their pictures on their tombstones really hated these photos but the family just chosen them because they were in their ID or something. These are always the ID-type pictures, mostly in a round frame rather than a square though. It's basically showing your ugly picture to everyone who doesn't even know you and it stays there for long long long years. No doubt why some ghosts are so hostile and angry, they are just pissed of because they have that ugly photo printed on their tombstone. 


I wanted to talk with my boyfriend about the picture I want to have on my tombstone. I am young and rather healthy, but you never know if a bus hits you dead on your way for groceries, so I want to set it just in case. He got uncomfortable talking about it and didn't even want to hear my ideas. Basically every person who I tried to talk about it was getting uncomfortable and no one wanted to talk about the topic. 


I just don't want everyone to look at my ID photo because I don't even look like me on it, the photographer photoshopped out my birthmark under my eye but sharpened the sh!t out of all my pimples and blurred my nose out. Why can't we just talk about tombstone pictures like ""If I die, I want this or that on my tombstone"", ""Okay, I'll save it. I would want this one, what do you think?"", ""Yeah that's pretty. Want some coffee?""."

My day is packed with obligations and day-to-day chores leaving a tight space for stuff that I want to do, so I have started cutting on everything that I consider secondary like replying to emails, checking message apps, even ironing or folding clothes. 

I feel like I am missing out on some things (for example being active on family/friends message groups) but it all comes down to the tradeoffs we are willing to do. 

I am more disorganized and less ""productive"" but I am able to release some time to enjoy my hobbies and interests.

I gotta say it's a really cool thing to do, it gives you energy, keeps you warm, and the very best part of it (although suspended for now because of covid) is sharing it with friends

It's also not just something they do casually like drinking coffee, there's a whole lore about it and different techniques, different styles, different materials to make it, everyone has their own kit to make it, it's been incredibly fun to learn

I had a conversation with the stranger about chicken. I asked her what she'd name it, she said chicky.

Is it wrong to be slightly upset/disappointed when your grandma got hundreds of thousands from a divorce and your uncle makes 6 figures with no debt and 1 teenager... And together they give you $25 cash?

....and your other cousins got a gaming PC and upgrades to their Corvette?

I am grateful, at least they thought of us and we got to spend time together. It's not the gift that hurts. But the obvious favoritism stings a little... Especially the whole family knows my mom support 3 kids alone on <20k a year

I am not a sporty person, I am rather skinny, and run out of stamina quickly, but I cherish the moments when I can ride my bike with him in the nature, or swim with my family. It is currently really cold where I am, and there is also snow, but it is just so bright, that it reminded me of the summer. I really love my brother, and even though we argue a lot (just the regular sibling arguments) we always make up quickly afterwards. If one of us is far away for more than a day for some reason, we always miss eachother, but never actually say it. I have the best big brother in the world"

Listening to music by different artists is so fun for me because they are all individuals with unique and personal tastes when making their own crafts. I like knowing the background stories of every song and album when it was first being written and composed.  I like knowing the motives and ambitions of song artists when they make music.

The conversation was good and interesting it peaked my interest to check it out.

The film was Black and White from 1960, and I was kinda turned off, but wanted to see if was as good as the podcast made it out to be, I said why not! 

And I was pleasantly surprised! It was very cool to see NYC in the 1960s, and experience something very outside of the norm. It felt so alien in a interesting way. I like twilight zone and star trek but those aren't as grounded as this.

It was very good and inspired me to start watching more classic movies. Any recommendations?"

i stay up late every single night because i just don't want to go to sleep. it's actually almost 1am as i'm writing this lol. i hate going to bed, i want to stay up all night and murder everybody on Blade and Sorcery and make music and have fun, but obviously i can't do that because my body will just be like ""no ❤""

but, what i can do is wake up earlier to have more time to do those things, especially because i am indeed a morning person.

based on that, i think a good new years resolution for me is start going to bed between 9:30pm-10:30pm, so i can have enough sleep and then wake up early in the morning to have more time to do the things i love before work or any other important thing that will take up most of my day.

is that any good? what do you guys think?"

but to end the year off i want to look back at some funny moments, either mine or not mine.

ill start;

in freshman year, my algebra class was doing a kahoot on god knows what, theres no way i remember. the teacher was fed up with all the fake meme names people would do, so she kicked any name not from the class.

my name is very similar to a certain very popular lebanese pornstar’s name, its only different by one letter.

when i joined the game with my full name, one quiet kid in the class just BURST out laughing yelling like “TEACHER TEACHER ITS NOT HIS REAL NAME 🤣🤣🤣” (not the exact words but the same idea). Cue my friends chewing him out (also loudly) about it being my real name. 

i had trouble keeping my sides in, especially since this dude doesnt make a sound on most days. 

(by the way, yes, the teacher was indeed very bad at keeping the class under control. IIRC she was fired for pepper spraying a student the year after but that could just be a rumor.)

how about you all?"

He wanted me to lie because the truth would have made her mad.  So anyway I lied and then after that I started lying about all kinds of things because I guess I didn't understand why lying about certain things is okay but lying about other things  isn't okay.  So I would make up stories about my day in school and I remember one day my dad asked me about one of these lies (again can't really remember the details specifically) and then when I revealed I had been lying he got mad.

In fact, it was quite sad; the same self-inflicted family dysfunction, now needlessly affecting a younger generation.

**Edit:** Just to add more context, Christmas Day largely consisted of bickering and arguments. The whole day was one that was marked, not with good will and festive joy but, with petty arguing.

This may not sound too dissimilar from many other households or families when it comes to this time of year. However, this seems to be the norm as far as my family is concerned, and not even Christmas Day can exceptions be made; no restraint, no patience, no thoughtfulness.

Upon arrival, I was met with the dysfunction from the second I stepped foot in the property. Given how hard this past year has been for me personally, in all matters, it just made my heart sink.

It's particularly sad as last year there wasn't much of a Christmas at all thanks to lockdowns. In addition, this will be the first Christmas the youngest in the family will likely really remember, given their age, and it will be for all the **wrong** reasons. On the other end of the spectrum is, given the poor health of certain other family members, that this could well be one of the last Christmas' we spend with them.

Yet, either nobody seems to be mindful of this, or if they are well aware, they simply can't help themselves.

It has made me feel pretty depressed."

I know I was there with my grandmother and rememberer talking with her and stopping by to look closely at the butterflies who were not bothered by me watching them.

I could see that split moment so clearly. It's not usual for me to remember such things. I can't really recall much from when I was a kid and have lost touch with that place and my grandmother many years ago. 

I'm wondering if it's a common thing to experience or if you dive into memories a lot more often and easier than me. Mine feels pretty much under a lock, but this was such a beautiful thing to come to me.

For the past 14 years I’ve been a very social person. Going to parties, events, lunch and dinners, hangs, dates, outings etc. Literally there was a 5 year period where I was going out pretty much every night if I could. 

I just really enjoy going out, and I unfortunately suffer from “fomo” if I miss something.

Lockdown finally gave me permission to just stay inside for a long period of time. I replayed old video games, got into multiplayers games with old childhood friends, read so many books, watched movies I had been meaning to see, got into plants, a routine work out schedule, lost 10 pounds, worked on some new paintings, got really into understanding myself and being introspective, worked on a bunch of projects I had been putting off. I felt like lockdown made me grow up in a sense. 

When the world somewhat opened up again, I finally had a healthy balance with going out and I felt so much more well rounded.

I was recently talking to my friends about this, and they said I was crazy for finding any kind of enjoyment in this. I don’t know. Made me realize I really appreciate quiet solitude just as much as chaotic party environments. Anyone relate?"

I'm stuck in bed with the flu, as is my fiance and son. Everyone that finds out, says ""let me know if you need anything"" but when I ,very rarely, call in on one of these favors, everyone conveniently forgets, or never answers... So with that out of the way, how guilty are we all of doing this?"

I was told I was making a grave mistake. I am now making about the same without all the stress.",1263,84,1640641869.0,"I was working in the aerospace industry, where OT was mandatory. Each pay period is 80 hours plus 32 hours of OT. That’s two extra hours Monday through Friday, plus six hours on Saturday. 

Basically, I was out of the house before sunrise and be home by sunset. Throw in some SoCal traffic, I was on a work sleep schedule for 2 years before I called it quits. 
 
When I gave my two week notice, my brother (who convinced me to get the job in the first place) said I was making a huge mistake. That I would be bringing home a lot less, and that this job is a once in a life time thing, and that other people would kill to be me. 

But I was too burned out to keep going. Also, the fact I was getting paid 15 dollars an hour didn’t help his argument.  

Flash forward to today, where my new boss sat me down and told me he was substantially increasing my pay. And on top of that, gave me a substantial bonus that would keep coming if I stayed with the company. 

I am now making pretty much the same, plus better benefits and a 401k option. Not only that, but I regained those 32 hours from not working OT. 

TL:DR: don’t drink the corporate kool aid. If you had enough and can move on, do it. Something better might be up ahead."

Some context: in the town I live one gets some money when donating blood (25 bucks). You get the money when you scan a barcode that is handed to you during the donation. 


Today, I went there to donate and overheard a conversation from a young lady that was right before me with the staff about being there for the first time (I'm 27 btw). The place was packed and the staff ladies were very nice but haven't had time to explain everything to her. I then decided to start a conversation with the young lady and tried to comfort her and explain everything to her. She was a little scared of the needle but at the end everything was fine. When I was waiting to be called in for the donation, another lady walked by and just handed me her barcode. She just gifted me 25 bucks out of nowhere. This really warmed my heart. I'm going to donate the money to charity to honor her gift. 


Forward those gifts and the kindness. This world is dark enough these times.

My partner and I visited my parents a weeks ago. They talked about how he has one pair of shoes and that those shoes are pretty worn out. 
My partner doesn't have a lot of money and doesn't really have a budget for a new (good quality) pair.

My partner and I visited again this weekend. He went home today. Turns out, they put an envelope with cash in his backpack. There was a note in it, that explains that the $150  is for new shoes and that they put it in his backpack since they know he has a hard time accepting money.

My partner called me. He asked me to thank my parents, but also call them crazy (in a kind way).

My town has a little over 7,000 people so, as you can imagine, the drag community here isn’t exactly a big one. So when I found this club, I got ecstatic.

They're all progressive metal/rock bands. Prog metal/rock is pretty much all I listen to.

Haken formed in London, England in 2007. Their debut album *Aquarius* was released in 2010 and they've released 5 albums & an EP since then. Their most recent album, *Virus*, was released last year (Title has nothing to do with COVID btw. They had the album ready in 2019 and then COVID struck, so they had to go with it. What are the odds, right?). My favorite song from them is Messiah Complex, a 17-minute prog metal epic, off of *Virus*. My favorite album from them is *Affinity*.

Leprous formed in Notodden, Norway 2001. They released a couple demos in the 2000s and their debut album didn't come out until 2009. They've released 6 more albums and a couple singles since then. They've transitioned from prog metal to prog rock and have gotten softer over the years, but they're still somewhat holding onto traditional sounds, and continue to hash out incredible music. Favorite song from them is *The Sky is Red* (11:22), the final track from their album *Pitfalls*. One of the most technically proficient and ominous songs I've ever heard. Favorite album is *Malina*, and it's my most favorite album of all time.

Between the Buried and Me formed in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA in 2000. Their debut self-titled album came out in 2002 and have released 8 more albums since, plus an EP (*The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues*) and a cover album (*The Anatomy Of*). However, I'm not a fan of that EP or their first 3 albums. They're too heavy for my taste. And I don't really care for cover songs, so I don't have their cover album either. But their discography from 2007's *Colors* to their most recent album, 2021's *Colors II*, is out of this world. My favorite album from them is *Colors II* and my favorite song is *Bad Habits* (8:43), off of *Colors II*."

I own a clinic with my family and one day this man, about 40 something years of age, showed up selling tamales. It’s not unusual to have people sell things here or ask for money. 

In this case he was selling tamales. He carried them around in his container and told me briefly that the proceeds where going directly to funding an expensive surgery his father needed. 

I usually don’t purchase stuff like this but in this case he looked sincere and his tamales were only $2 USD. So I completed the transaction and bid him farewell thinking that was the end of it.

A few weeks later he comes by again selling tamales once more. I say hi to the gentleman  and I accept and purchase  another round. We say goodbye and head our separate ways. 

Now, after a few more weeks he appears again. This time early around 9:30am when he usually drops by at 4pm. I go to unlock the door and let him in but I notice he doesn’t have his container. I found that odd. 

When stepped inside the clinic he had tears in his eyes. His face was wrinkled and the weight of something terrible was on his shoulders, that much was clear by how he looked at me. 

I asked him in Spanish “what happened?”

He just hung his head and this man started weeping, saying that his father passed. 

I was stunned. I knew not who he was but seeing a older gentleman like this in front of me, crying his eyes out like a child was paralyzing.

The only thing I could do was hug him. 

And he wept."

She is very feminine and the definition of a soft girl but accidently has giant biceps and abs that she tries to hide. I'm convinced she is the most adorable and lovely person I've ever met.

My bust measurement is the same as my legs. If my top half skin was a fruit roll up and my bust was removed from the bottom half of me and unrolled it would be as long as my legs. So that's weird.

In my normal behavior when I travel I'm always amazed by the landscape that defile before my eyes. But the ones which definitively make me dream are the landscape where you can see some fields and mountains far away.

Now the scenery was exactly that duo : field + Mountain far away. I guess that from there come my amazement for theses kind of landscape that I thinked were the norm everywhere when I was younger and traveled a bit outside my childhood city.

I would to know of there is some theory behind my behavior or if someone feel the same about ""their"" dreamt scenery and have a similar story:)"

3. Chocolate chip bricks chocolate chipped my tooth. 
4. Made a batter, not a dough. Chocolate chip…cake?!?
5. Made each cookie ball too big. One giant, flat cookie. Squares?

Update: thanks for the tips everyone! I’m putting them to the test and will update with results! :)

Update: 
It worked! Kinda! I found a Betty Crocker recipe that worked really well as long as I cut the amount of chocolate chips in half. That tip about timing helped a lot. I put in a full batch but took out one cookie every minute between the lowest and highest cook time. Now I know how to make this recipe softer or harder. 

I also realized that there’s a lot of sugar in chocolate chip cookies and to me the texture is a bit grainy, so I’m trying them again but with liquid sugar.

Which i mean, it's fair, the world can't go for a halt otherwise society would crumble

would you mind not being able to go to grocery like at all during 1-2 days leading and on the actual Christmas day? 

obviously, some job is impractical or reckless to stop during the holidays, like emergency room and power grid monitoring. And a shipping container crew would've sailed a month or two before Christmas so it's not like they're skipping 2 months' pay just for a holiday.  but how about a fulfillment center? it's quite a complex logistical nightmare to halt everything but it's not like it's essential right?

for that matter what would you even consider essential/urgent? grocery is essential but you can just do it the day before or after. power and internet should be essential IMO but what about commercial flight 

to be fair though, the overworking during Christmas is like a self-inflicted wound, you want stuff for Christmas so you work harder during Christmas, but would Christmas feel genuinely the same without the overworking beforehand?"

As time goes on I've wondered what pieces of internet culture will be remembered and to what extent. 

My gut tells me relatively older stuff will be better remembered because there was less noise to breakthrough and (at least to me) content seemed less niche whereas now everything is optimized to your feed. On the flip side, as we continue moving forward we'll see more people engaged in internet culture and some of it should catch fire and gain more views, right? 

Maybe internet culture will parallel mediums like music or TV where options have increased but you can recall highlights from any time period. Maybe there is too much noise and it's too niche that outside of smaller pockets most specific internet culture won't be remembered outside of the platforms or websites that we engaged on. 

Just a random thought I had. Would love to hear your opinion on this."

Why do they continuously pick on me? They think it's funny to whisper and laugh but that shit sticks with me. I can't forget it. I wish I could cut some people off. Real family shouldn't make you feel worthless.  They make me feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. I just want to be accepted.

You get them in the cold case at the grocery store, and they're little pillow shaped things filled with tomato sauce and cheese and little cubes of sausage and/or pepperoni, depending on what kind you get.  


But does anyone remember the egg roll variety?  


I remember in the ancient days of my youth, when the parents would be in the mood for Chinese, and we couldn't just order out because we lived out in the middle of nowhere? Mom would get the big cans of chow mein, the Rice A Roni Fried Rice in a box... and a bag of what LOOKED like pizza rolls, but WEREN'T. They were tiny egg rolls, visibly identical to pizza rolls, but containing... well... they were not like the egg rolls you'll get at a Chinese restaurant, but they were the first egg rolls I ever ate.  


Anyone else remember these?"

How's your day been?,15,4,1640561303.0,"Some background information about me here. I'm happily married, and we have an adorable and loving 4yo boy together. In addition, I'm also looking after my older sister's mellow yet affectionate 10yo son. I've helped raise my nephew since he was 2 years old, so I kind of became his father figure for the time being.  My son is more affectionate with Mum compared to me, and he was sleeping with her in our room during this event.

It's the day after Christmas, and what's better than snuggling in bed with your loved ones and chill out? And we did just that, with my nephew deciding to invite me to his room for a little gaming (and eventual cuddling) session for the night. I sat on his bed next to him, and we played lots of stuff on the Nintendo Switch in his room, ranging from FIFA to Mario Kart. Then he said he started to feel a bit tired and wanted to lay down on my lap. I had asked if he wanted to go to sleep so I could turn the Switch off, but he told me he wanted to continue playing. Around half an hour later, he fell asleep with his head resting on my lap, snoring softly while laying on his side. He looked angelic and serene, his light brown hair hanging over his forehead. I cuddled him for a bit, then I turned him over to his back, tucked him into a blanket and kissed him good night before turning the Switch and the TV off and leaving his room, ending our gaming night together. It's 11:30pm here, and I'm enjoying my late night whiskey while typing this.

She's normally pretty standoffish and doesn't really like being touched beyond the occasional head or tummy scratch.  If anyone sits next to her, she moves away. Not aggressive or skittish, just very independent. Apparently, she either realized I needed the support or she just needed a little extra herself,  because she walked up to me, nudged her head under the blanket, laid down in my lap, and is now fast asleep. This is the first time she's done this in the three years we've been together.

Aircraft engines over head, the river of cars meandering along a highway a few miles off in the distance. Trains and light rail. People living their busy lives creating the low hum of industrialized society; it may disappear into our subconscious but it's there all the time.

Even in residential neighborhoods; it's barking dogs, playing children, leaf blowers and power tools, TVs or radios ringing out from open windows. Cars making their way down the streets, the Doppler sound of distant sirens. Even the wind in the trees or the chirping of the birds; it's *always* there. ...which is all the more reason why this was such a special moment.

I was outside, mid morning, going about my day in a moderately busy, part commercial / part residential neighborhood, when suddenly it happened. It was like someone had hit ""pause"". Like the synchronicity of conversations in a crowded noisy room that unexpectedly comes to a collective silence. But there was nothing awkward about this. It was blissful; like finding yourself in the spaces in between the frames of a film. I stood there, in that moment, taking it all in and wanting it not to end. No planes, no cars, no wildlife, no people noises, nothing, just peaceful calm. It's the only time in my life I've ever experienced anything like it. It was *very* nice.

Personally I have multiple computers as I do video, music and sometimes need to bring a laptop on jobs. I find everything to be better on a computer. I hate stripped down mobile interfaces, although I prefer to use my phone for podcasts and youtube videos that dont need to be on a big screen. 

I work in peoples houses too and I dont often see a nice computer setup with a big display. If you do a lot of computer based worked, getting like a 38"" widescreen will change your life.

But I’m slowly approaching 30 and I felt that sentiment shifting in the past year. 

We would always spend Christmas with my younger cousins and they couldn’t make it this year due to covid and I realised it was a lot less fun without kids. And that I want to have kids. Because (I personally feel that) it’s more fun and that I actually like having them around and taking care of them. I used to dislike the idea, now I’m excited about it.

But at the same time, I feel like I’m betraying feminism? So many women are not taken seriously when they say they don’t want kids. People always say “You will change your mind” and be super condescending about it. And now that I actually changed my mind, I feel like I’m proving these people right. 

Anyone feels the same (or different!)? Anyone changed their mind about kids to the more “traditional” option? How do you feel about it?

EDIT: I phrased it poorly. I do not think feminism means you can’t have kids. I just feel like I was forced to have an opinion about having or not having kids and defending that opinion for some years. And now it feels weird changing my mind about such and important topic.

I also do not base my wish to have children on a one-off Christmas with my cousins. I have some experience with children (although not parenting), the cousins thing was more of a trigger.

And I never said I want to be pregnant specifically, I might adopt or foster if I do decide to have kids."

The day he went missing, I just thought that maybe he was going somewhere with his cat friends or maybe a female cat. But the next day he didn't come back, I knew that he was gone. Some effing kidnapers saw him on the street and took him to the butcher and now he might be in some old man's stomach. I don't know... I can't really tell but it's a thing here. They take random cats and dogs on the street and sell them to restaurant for money. That next day, I suddenly woke up at 6am and I cried thinking about him. Yesterday I just had a dream he came back but in that dream, he didn't have mouth or nose. He was there, I picked him up but when I looked at him, there were only the eyes that look back at me. I can still hear him meowing but there's nothing here. I follow a lot of accounts with videos of cats, dogs, pets... Now looking at those videos, I can't smile anymore. I used to smile or laugh really hard at them because when I see them, I think about my cat and my dog, my buddies. Now he's gone, I don't feel like watching those videos anymore. I just scrolled through it really fast. 
That's all I wanna say, I miss my cat.

This is the longest I've ever slept. And I'm not even going to try and sleep tonight. It will be too hard, and I have nothing on tomorrow. So I can't believe I've never purposely stayed up all night as a 21 year old - but I will tonight!

I don't know why I've never done that. It's just societal pressure that tells me I need to sleep. So anybody who's up late and wants to be my friend - I am looking for people to chat to, and would love a late night chat buddy.

I dunno. I will randomly go out to my moms house or my dad's house throughout the year but will avoid going to spend time with them during any holiday. I've never really enjoyed any holiday (except st Patrick's day but day drinking used to be my thing so there's that). But as I've gotten older and older I just see how either side of my family gets crazier and crazier as Christmas approaches and it just puts me in a pissy ass mood until its all finally over. Like my mom trying to stretch out her bills so she can afford to buy everyone she has ever known at least one present for Christmas (family gets 3, me and my sis get 4 to 5 even if I tell her don't get me anything). Or just things around my dad and step mom getting more and more up tight about everything being perfect and clean and doting on my lil sis (she deserves it though so that's not really a problem I have, just don't like being around it a whole lot and don't like being involved). 


Also I really wanted to order a pizza last night but dominoes was closed and I just woke up even more pissed off this morning.

I don't dislike him at all but siblings have a special knack for getting on your nerves.


Tonight at our family Christmas get-together, he asks my wife for our keys to move our van so he can park behind us and he snuck a brand new PS5 into the back that I didn't discover until the family event had ended.


I am a full time working parent with 2 small children and another one on the way and wouldn't have been able to afford a PS5 for years to come.
He still won't admit that he put it there and I honestly didn't think he'd do anything like this for me. It really touched me.

So I was just in the drive through line at McDonald's, and being that it was the only option open on Christmas I braved the hour long line so my wife didn't have to cook. We both worked today (12 hour shifts), her on graveyard getting off this morning, so we both have little energy or desire to cook for the kids or ourselves after a few sleepless nights of gift wrapping and working (I'll cook tomorrow)

My local McDonald's has a 2-Lane system for ordering that merges to a single line for pay and pick-up. I am about as polite and patient as a Canadian Choir boy, so when my (right) line starts moving I elect to wait for the person in the left (still ordering) so they may go ahead. I did this to preserve the 1-for-1 ""zipper merge"" philosophy I think everyone should adopt, regardless if it's for highways or hamburgers.I was scrolling reddit the entire time in line, so I really wasn't concerned about waiting an extra 2 minutes.

Unbeknownst to me the person I had allowed to merge **somehow believed *they* had cut *me* off** and told the worker at the window they felt bad. Whether it was genuinely out of some misplaced guilt (it really was their turn to go, I swear) or maybe it was just Holiday spirit, this person had paid for my entire family's meal! I sat there utterly flabbergasted that this person was even more polite and guilt ridden then I've ever felt in a fast food line. And this was no cheap McD ticket either...

As I sat there and collected my thoughts on how this (probably actual Canadian) had come to such a misguided conclusion I overheard the window workers chatting about a charity chain that had started in a similar fashion some months earlier.

I said screw it, handed the employee a near equivalent amount of cash my bill would have been, and asked them to cover whoever was behind me as well (might've covered a few cars)

To my Misguided Mystery Canadian, thank you. You put a smile on my face this Christmas and it was truly needed. I hope everyone who was able continued to pay it forward.

Merry Christmas

*Edit*: Just for clarification I am **not** Canadian (part of me wishes I was) and this did not happen in Canada. I was just using the overly polite Canadian stereotype for my story. I live in Southern California"

Prior to this trip, I only rode my bike around my city to do errands. That's it.

And from this trip, I was able to do 210 km (80km on day 1, 90km - day 2, and 40km - day 3). And honestly, after day 1, I wanted to quit so bad because my legs and butt were sore. But ended up pushing on. At the end of day 2, same thing, I wanted to give up. But again, pushed through.

Now that it's over, despite the challenge both physically and mentally, I am honestly SOOOO proud of myself for pushing through those 3 days. Despite my legs basically being super sore..

So ya. I don't really have anyone to tell this to. As someone that's naturally a pessimist, this was one of the few things this year that I am actually REALLY proud of.

Anyways, Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays reddit :)"

cant carry stuff while on crutches so im taking my food from the kitchen with me in this little hard bottom tote bag i hold in my mouth. i know what you’re thinking: it feels incredibly primal to grip my claim in my teeth and take my keep back into my den.

distracting myself with easy to watch, lowest-common-denominator hollywood movies from the 21st century. given up on my usual preferences as i was gonna try and work thru my film backlog but my pain addled mind couldnt really properly appreciate stuff like “the face of another” or  “ali: fear eats the soul.”

don’t look up was very bad. 22 jump street was surprisingly good.

will be requesting a handicap seat in the theater because i’m still gonna try and go see the new apichatpong weerasethakul movie next week.

been a fairly bleak holiday season following a quarantine cancelled thanksgiving but spirits are decent for now and im gonna keep taking the pill-pill as long as they’ll allow me. maybe i can score some more good dope off the surgeon when i go in for my consultation/MRI.

rok8a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/rok8a0/i_finally_took_the_cokepepsi_challenge/,I finally took the Coke/Pepsi Challenge!,15,15,1640475675.0,"I honestly don't know what took me so long. I remember seeing the commercials when I was a kid about people doing a blind taste test with two cups (one with coke and one with pepsi) and revealing that they liked pepsi more. What I lacked was the ability to get both sodas at that age, and the fact that when I was of money age, I'd forgotten about the challenge entirely.

In my high school psychology class, my teacher did a day where she performed the Coke/Pepsi challenge to see if students *could tell which is which*. But she was sneaky and gave half the class two cups of coke. I understand *why* she did it that way, since someone could claim they're different when they were actually the same, but it still seemed dumb. Either way, I missed that day, so I never got to take the test.

Then today (yes, Christmas day), I went to grab gas and for the first time I was looking at two bottles, realizing that I always wanted to do this test and never did. So I bought one bottle of Pepsi and one of Coke, took them home, poured equal amounts into identical cups (pepsi had a piece of tape on the bottom), and move the cups around with my eyes closed while listening to music and counting random numbers. Basically, I did everything I could to lose focus on which cup was in each hand, since I only need to prove it to myself.

I did this twice, and **both times I was right! I accurately guessed which was Pepsi and which was Coke!**

But here is a bit of a takeaway.

1. My sense of smell absolutely failed me. The first cup I picked up, I said ""Yup, smells like Pepsi!"" and it was Coke. So thankfully I didn't judge from smell alone.
2. The challenge was more difficult than I thought it would be. For a moment I wasn't sure which was which. This is why I did it twice, to make sure my first guess wasn't a fluke. My first guess, I was only about 60% sure I was right, and on my second guess I was 90% sure I was right.
3. Pepsi only has 2 more grams of sugar than coke, but if you really pay attention, you can tell it is ever so slightly sweeter. It has a *sharper* taste while coke is slightly more smooth. This still wasn't enough to convince me I was right.
4. The biggest giveaway was the carbonation. I knew how pepsi felt on my tongue regardless of flavor, and that's what drove me the most to realize which one was Pepsi. 

&#x200B;

It was a fun, cheap experiment that I suggest anyone try. But the entire challenge was made up to fing out which beverage people prefer. **So, which do I prefer?**

The answer is: It depends on my mood and purpose.

Coke - This is what my family purchased when I was a kid. I find Coke to be the preferred drink if I'm having it with a meal, or if stuff is being mixed into it (be it flavorings or alcohol). Coca-Cola is the drink that *pairs well* with others. It's a team player.

Pepsi - I drank this more as a teen and in college. Is best when it's on its own. If you want something refreshing between meals, or if you're on a long drive somewhere. Pepsi stands out rather than blending well with the crowd.

Due to those reasonings, when it comes time for a caloric beverage, Coke does usually win out for me. But Pepsi still has a place in my life for those occasions where I just want a soda and nothing else. I'm happy both are here to stay.

&#x200B;

Have any of you done this challenge before? How did it go, and which do you prefer and why?"

I have an anecdote about a gift he brought one year, too.  I have lived most of my life in snowy country and, when I had to move to a balmy clime for a while, I found myself dearly missing the snow. So, on a whim,  I asked Santa, in my mind, on Christmas Eve, for snow.   The next morning I woke up to a thick covering of  *hail on the ground!*  I lived there for 9 years and the only time it hailed at my house was that Christmas morning.   I ran out and picked some up in my hands and lifted it to my face to feel the cold bite and i could smell it and *it smelled just like snow!*     And then I knew for sure that Santa had brought it!   :D"
rojwo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/rojwo2/languages_are_wild/,Languages are wild,16,6,1640474618.0,"My first language isn't English, but I know English better having been raised in the US. I was listening to a song in my first language and to me the singer was singing sooo fast (like the lyrics were fast), so I played it out loud for my friend (who only speaks English) and she said that it sounded as if she was singing a normal speed. 

Thinking about it, I'm reminded of my linguistics class where we talked about how some languages are capable of packing a large amount of information into smaller units than other languages. For example, in English, ""name"" means the thing someone or something is called by. If you wanted to say ""her name"", you added another word. But some languages, like my native language, will just add an ending onto name that says it's someone's name, and it's more fluid and faster than having a separate pronoun. That example is a small one where the difference in speed isn't much at all, but imagine it applied to an entire language where a single ending can take the place of multiple words in a sentence. Going back to the song I played... To me, she was talking super fast because she was saying a lot of information that I was mentally translating into English. The translation was a lot more words than she was saying. It was like my brain somehow correlated ""lots of information"" with ""talking fast"", so although she was singing a perfectly normal speed, my brain had me convinced she was Eminem in Rap God.

In fact we've actually let a handful of them pretty much live here for weeks at a time if they needed because their own home situation wasn't great. A lot of those friends throughout the years ""don't look like me"", or my kids.  Anyway, we had 12 total people over, about half of them was family and the other half were friends of the kids. My youngest son had his 2 best friends over. One is black, and one is Mexican. My daughter had her roomate, and her SO over. Both of them are trans, and use he/him type pronouns. Also over was my MIL's husband, he's about as much of a racist redneck type of a guy out there. We made sure everyone had gifts to open, food to eat and just a great time.  Overall it was a wonderful Christmas, that I was happy I could host!  I'm really happy that we seem to be raising our kids to love everyone, especially during this time of the year."

I like kids just fine and all, but I don’t believe they’re for me. And of course I don’t have any right now. I noticed that at family get-togethers that I’ve previously looked so much forward to, I’ve started to dread them and sometimes avoid them altogether since literally everyone suddenly began having children. I feel so out of place. I’m not looking for any kind of pity, I just have absolutely nothing to add to conversations that solely revolve around babies now. Can anyone else relate? Does anyone have any advice on how to “deal” with suddenly feeling so out of place? I hope everyone has had a nice holiday!"
rohybv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/rohybv/i_accidentally_called_my_teacher_by_his_first_name/,i accidentally called my teacher by his first name,3,5,1640468027.0,"so basically, due to the amount of emails my school/teachers use to communicate, i see all of their full names daily. 

i see their first and last names more than i see “mr/mrs whoever”, and i also don’t call them by their surnames a lot because i just say “sir” or “miss” to get their attention. 

so i was talking to one of my teachers about a different teacher and i accidentally called the other teacher (the one who wasn’t there) by his first name (because that’s the way i’m used seeing his name, in emails). 

i laughed it off and quickly corrected myself but i’m having so many anxiety attacks over whether he’s judging me or assuming things about me and the other teacher  —  and especially worried whether he told the other teacher about my slip up. 

it was on the last day of school before christmas so i’m hoping when i go back he’ll have forgotten about it but what if he’s already spoken to the other teacher? 

anyone with any reassurance would really help."

The title is basically referring to surnames that are synonymous with famous persons. I'm referring to surnames like 'DiCaprio', or absolutely legendary surnames, like 'Mozart'. Infamous surnames also apply, like 'Hitler', for example. 

Could be any non-famous person you know of, through any means. 

There's like 20-30 surnames in my country and they're not synonymous with any famous person, so I'm curious what it's like in other countries. Did you have a 'Stalin' in your class who got bullied for it, or maybe a 'Cobain' who's really tired of being told what he smells like? 

PS: Common surnames like 'Smith' and 'Jackson' obviously don't count.

So has anyone else here had a friend but for some reason you cannot get me into the friendship? Like there is NO apparent reason why you shouldn’t like this person but you just don’t? 

For example: I’ve had this on/off friendship with girl for 10 years! We are 24. We’ve had our issues but always became friends again. The thing is she loves me more than I love her. It’s awful but my heart chakra (if you believe that stuff) has been closed off from her from the start. Not to sound silly but when I feel this way it’s usually my soul literally telling me that something isn’t right (I learned this the hard way). The issue is this person seems to love and admire me so much. She has issues with being immature and impulsive. She has has habit of blocking me anytime we get an argument. She always comes back and gives a sincere apology but I still feel“off” about her. Like I’m not seeing something about her. 

Anyway randomly out the blue the moon the other day I just felt this strong urge to express to her that I didn’t trust her because of her behavior sometimes and the instability of our friendship! We were in great place but for some reason I just didn’t feel right about her. She didn’t react well to this even though I told her I wanted us to get better. Who wouldn’t want a friend who adores them?! It’s like I didn’t like how much she liked me. If that makes sense? It’s weird. I cannot for the life of me figure why I don’t like her. She’s pretty pleasant and fun in general. 

I feel so bad about it but also fell like I didn’t lose anything nor do I miss her. I feel something is wrong with me!?"

Was the woman guilty or not? her behavior, was the interrogator in the wrong? What situation if any would his tactic have been appropriate and effective. It has been an insight on how deep our minds go for possibility’s. There hasn’t been discussions this deep since the time we fought over rather an outfit was fashion or trash on a Project Runway binge."

There's no way Santa travels at light speed, like *SOME* people say (cough cough). We've seen the video clips of him in houses, taking his sweet time eating the cookies, drinking the milk, etc… If he spent a full minute in each house he visited, there'd be no way he'd visit all of them in time. And a full minute's a bit of a generously quick estimate.

No. What Santa does is exploit quantum uncertainty to visit multiple houses at once, in batches of several thousand or more. This is why it's so important that he does his gift giving in secret, because if he's observed, it will collapse the quantum waveform, and ruin Christmas!"

I have actually really wanted to change it since getting into the corporate world because on paper people keep expecting me to be a man and it’s pretty annoying. 

My friends think my birth name suits me and the names I have mentioned as possibilities didn’t get much favor because they weren’t unique enough for me. But Ive been seriously thinking about it for like 3 years now and I can’t find anything that suits me well enough to merit changing it!"

Like, fast breathing, chest tightening if even a tiniest one moved in my vicinity kind of scared.  


But since some time, I have been trying to learn not to fear them. I sometimes got close to take a picture, or tried to supress my reflexes to kill them, instead just leaving them be and letting them escape. Today, I was grabbing a leash for my dog, and I saw a tiny spider hanging out on it. It was like, maybe the size of your smallest fingernail, if not smaller. My first reflex was to at least smack it away, but I did something else instead.  


I grabbed a small piece of paper, carefully let the tiny guy climb on it, and left it outside. However, after a minute or so, it occurred to me that it's -5C outside (23 degrees F), and I dropped him into some snow. So I went back, and here it was, still roughly in the same area. It was moving around, but very slowly. I did the same thing as before - scooped the guy on some paper, and this time, I dropped him somewhere near the cupboard. He immediately started to move faster, and crawled under the cupboard.  


I hope he's okay now, and that I didn't accidentally break any of his appendages."

I know, a lot of users complain that Reddit is toxic. But it's not true. Reddit is not toxic, some poeple in it are, just as in real life you have certain family members you avoid during ocassions. Isn't that how family is supposed to work?

I made friends I never knew I had. I shared a good laugh with many of them. Cried a few tears of joy at r/MadeMeSmile. Wished I could meet some of them in real life. Shared some of my worst nightmares with complete strangers. What more would you want from an online community that gives you are community to belong to.

Thanks Reddit, and Merry Christmas Everyone here."

A bit strange though. It feels like a darker Amelie.
Even though it's supposed to be Black Comedy, it feels like a Horror movie at times due to the way that the male lead, Yun-Ju treats dogs.
I saw a lot of mysef in the female lead Hyun-Nam.
The opening scene of her on the train with the Jazz music playing felt like a scene from one of my own stories.

Looking back I can't believe what c*nts we both were and if I were to teleport back to that time, I would have punched myself square in the face for being so disrespectful. My mom were trying her best on a tight budget to at least give us something to open on Christmas. 

Every year on Christmas I think back to this time and I think of how heartbroken my mom must have been. Not only did she provide for us in every other way, she was trying her best.

I have definitely grown wiser now (I am now 27 years old and this happened about 10-15 years ago), and Christmas now definitely doesn't mean gifts to me anymore, it means spending time with your loved ones and enjoying the Festive time.

I couldn’t even attend one class on campus because of the pandemic. I still have 3 subjects + internship to do before I can get my degree. 

My dad seems disappointed in me for not joining the family business. My cousin on the other hand has finished his bachelors and joined the family business and looks quite well settled into it. I had the opportunity to join the business before my masters and I did try it out but I felt miserable everyday because the work was quite mundane. I did quite well in my diploma in mathematics and I got an opportunity to study my masters, hence I left my family business. 

I don’t see myself settling in the country of my family business as opportunities for the young is quite dull, plus social life is non-existent hence me leaving. 

But sometimes for a 27 year old I feel like I accomplished nothing and am being left behind. I don’t have my masters yet. I don’t have a job. I don’t hold any assets like a house. I don’t have a partner who I see a future with. Nothing. My relatives also taunt me about this sometimes.

The last entry was 4 years ago, as i was finishing my masters thesis. 

The last line was “I am starting to feel a little bit scared but i know it will be alright, i am strong.” 

4 years later, i’ve completed my masters, two weeks ago i completed my last exam for my professional accountancy exam, i’ve been temporarily (6 months) relocated to our US HQ for work. 

I last opened my journal (it’s a digital one - Penzu), on October 21 and put an entry in, telling my past self “Everything turned out alright, you're strong and you are capable!” 

But part of me feels like i owe myself, and should tell myself all that i’ve done over the last 4 years. 

Sorry, this turned out to be a semi putting my feelings out there, rather than a simple question"

I was raised in a Mexican household, but my father (who is bilingual) only spoke to us in English. As a result, my brother and I only know English and a little bit of Spanish. This makes it harder for me to speak to my mother and my relatives in Mexico who only know Spanish.

Anyway, tonight I had a conversation with my grandmother. Usually, I would say hi to her, ask how she has been, and tell her I love her and pass the phone back to my dad. However, today we spent at least an hour talking to each other and she even pointed out that my Spanish has gotten better. Yeah, I still made moments where I asked my dad to translate a word from English to Spanish, but I still held a pretty good and long conversation with her. The only person I am able to do that with is my mother, so this was a pleasant surprise.

I am just going to continue improving my Spanish skills and hopefully I am able to hold a conversation without asking for a translation of a word every five minutes. 

That's my epic backstory folks. I hope you have a great night and a wonderful Christmas!"

She and my dad were broke. They had no money for presents and barely enough for food. But they told no one for whatever reason. She said she remembers staring out of the window of our cabin in Shingletown so sad. A car pulled up in the driveway from (I believe) the local church or Salvation Army with a turkey dinner and pink and blue presents for a boy and girl. We got a Christmas that year and it meant a lot to my struggling young parents. I don't remember of course but I know now and will never forget and my mom certainly never forgot. As part of my new job I got to hand out adopt a senior gift bags. I went door to door and gave away gift bags to grateful struggling seniors. Those toy donations and food drives and gift baskets and monetary donations mean something to someone you've never met. But it means that someone out there loves them and is thinking about them and wanting nothing in return. That's a pretty cool holiday miracle.

Idk what else I’m getting but i know about the phone.

We opened one Christmas eve present each and my present to my dad was so good that i made him cry. (It was a photo book) Yep so i won Christmas obviously some individuals have tried to tell me that one cannot “win” Christmas but that is the word of losers. 

I know Christmas isn’t all about presents but honestly I’m so excited for this phone its a iphone xs max. Im so excited so I just want to go to sleep and wake up later I’m so close to Christmas morning 

Still weirdly enough doesn’t feel like Christmas though idk these past few years has gotten my internal calendar all out of wack also doesn’t help that its not gonna snow and will probably be sunny unless it rains. I want a white Christmas one day like in the movies

I forget what I got my brother so I guess i will also be surprised by that

I did not have an awkward childhood stage, and I even had a guy say he liked me.

Post puberty I got a bunch of acne and gained some weight in my face that I can't lose (seems to be due to bad genetic luck). My hair got darker and thicker, and I just got uglier.

Where fantasy means reality, Jorge Luis Borges makes his appearance. JLB is not bound by the physical laws. Infinity is just not a hypothetical concept to him but a reality. Reading his stories makes you feel the intangible as tangible.

Tell me what things you're proud of. What was the best day of your life?

Why is talking with pride so shunned."

But since I was a kid we've always done Christmas festivities and opened presents on the 24th, and instead of... Santa bringing presents overnight they'd gradually appear through the days before Christmas Eve and we'd open them at night. This is my first year celebrating Christmas a day later which is weird because never before did we treat the 25th like a holiday and on Christmas Eve we're not doing anything.

When do you guys, if at all, celebrate Christmas?"
