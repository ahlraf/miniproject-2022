I can't get through a single day without purging. 
I eat other people's food and my parents have a separate fridge that everyone is allowed to go in besides me, my parents lock up food downstairs (an actual room with a lock on the door) that everyone has the key to except me. 
Constant arguments about me eating too much and eating food I'm not allowed to eat. My family does not keep any sweet things around and they do not buy me any bad food, so when I get it, I really want it. 
Every time we eat out or order food, or get any ""unhealthy"" food, there is so much tension because everyone is afraid I'll eat too much and purge
I get screamed at and shamed whenever I eat other people's food and have to pay money for what I ate (I don't have a job or a stable source of income so this is hard)
My family does not keep any unhealthy food where I access it so there is no balance of healthy and unhealthy in my diet
My parents are thinking about putting a lock on the fridge and pantry, and I cannot even began to say how humiliating that would be. I am beside myself. 
I am a healthy weight (bmi 20.8), 17 yr female, had an eating disorder for 7 years. I want to lose more weight so bad (I want a bmi of 15.9) so this is why I purge so much. And I have constant craving due to not eating enough (bc I want to lose), thus the binging and purging.
This is all just so embarrassing and humiliating and I just want to crawl up and hide. I'm not happy and all I think about is food, my body, my weight. I am extremely aggressive around food. I become so irritable. I have small cavities in all my teeth, I'm constantly freezing and lightheaded. It's just terrible. I need a sense of directions. How can I help myself and how can my parents helps me?"

The habits I plan to break:

‚Ä¢ ruining food so that I can‚Äôt eat it

‚Ä¢ immediately checking the nutritional facts on everything I‚Äôm eating

‚Ä¢ avoiding food I crave just because it is deemed ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù by diet culture

‚Ä¢ sneaking food so nobody sees me eat

‚Ä¢ no liquid calories whatsoever

‚Ä¢ refusing food I know I like due to judgement

‚Ä¢ never trying new food due to fear of allergic reaction

‚Ä¢ never eating in front of people

‚Ä¢ exercising before and after I eat

‚Ä¢ laxative pill abuse

‚Ä¢ buying things I want to eat them throwing them away so I can‚Äôt binge on them

‚Ä¢ only eating at 6:30

‚Ä¢ only eating one food at a time

‚Ä¢ cutting everything up in small bites

‚Ä¢ waiting 15 minutes after i eat anything in case of allergic reaction

‚Ä¢ weighing myself every morning and after I eat anything

‚Ä¢ measuring my thighs and waist everyday

‚Ä¢ tracking my calories everyday

I've seen a lot of different definitions thrown around here, and I was wondering what the official criteria is that makes something bulimia as opposed to EDNOS, BED, or anorexia b/p subtype. 

Like, does any extreme compensatory behavior count as purging (like fasting or excessive exercise) or is it only vomiting and/or laxatives? 

Also, does the type of binge count (""planned"" vs ""unplanned"")? 

What if you have long periods of just restriction in between? How often does the b/p have to occur to count as bulimia? 

I'm also wondering in regards to myself, because after months of only restriction (what I would have thought of as anorexia: rapid weight loss, intense fear of food/weight gain), I fell into a week of standard b/p (unplanned binges followed by puking, daily), and now I'm in a new pattern of having a ""cheat day"" followed by fasting, excessive exercise, and restriction."

I started reading today. Cried twice, which is a big deal for me as I'm autistic and not very demonstrative with my emotions. I did my yoga and at the end Adriene said to say something kind to yourself, I said ""you don't deserve this"", and cried again. I did the first two exercises in the book, which are about pros and cons of recovery to you and others, and your fears, basically. Also two letters from future you, one if things are going well, and one if they're not.

I have already mentioned to two (supposedly good) friends who I had fairly imminent food-related plans with (bottomless brunch and an afternoon tea) that I'm going through a hard time and might need to postpone or change plans because of the work I need to start. I think having plans not being focused on food is important for my recovery now. 

One hasn't responded at all, one said ""oh OK"", and nothing else.

A big part of my ""cons"" was what people would think and if they would like me less or think I was selfish for being more assertive about what isn't helpful for me right now and this is not helping.

I think a really difficult part of this is going to be acknowledging that some relationships are not going to come forward with me... and I am so insecure and needy (autism!) I will find that very hard. 

Luckily two other friends were much nicer about it. But I think this journey will be an eye opener."

I used to purge water and healthy safe foods. I weighed 44kg as 21 year old and it made me feel beautiful and empowered. Last year, I had no motivation to quit and I quietly embraced the fact that I will die young because of my disease. Throughout the last year, I had horrible dreams about my demise, saw terrible pictures of girls who died because of bulimia, and felt like I didn't want to be like them even though I am one of them, or was. I am just too frightened of death and the whole idea of causing such horror to the people close to me - and who are aware of my disease - is unsettling. So I decided to quit it. And I couldn't. I lied to those who are closest to me and who were monitoring my eating habits as I was purging small nutritious meals. And then I tried to convince myself that I need energy for school and work and it is unfathomable that a human body can survive like this. I started keeping down the most measly and basic foods like fruits and some veggies and maybe some meat. Gradually, I was able to have a full meal in a day but nothing else since I am still haunted by the body-perfect obligations that I had made for myself. Then, the most unexpected thing happened. I didn't gain weight! Maybe 1 or 2 kgs but not that alarming at all. It took so many years to realize that eating amounts of food correspondant to your body needs maintains your weight and doesn't make you gain any. I started being regular and saw my body change for the better. A few weeks a go I started BP again like twice a week but I stopped again because I REALLY want to heal. The road is tough and takes time but believe me, IT IS WORTH IT."

3. Spicy omelettes. Too spicy to barf up and too healthy to have (heavy) intrusive thoughts about. Find your own spicy omelette.

I had a purging break between March 2020 and the summer (after regularly purging since early 2018), since I was living with my parents at the time and didn't know how to hide it from them. This may have started during the break, but it continued after I started purging again, and it only got worse after I moved into my current apartment and again quit purging. I'm going to hit my three month mark in a week and I don't even feel the urge for it anymore, which is great.

But my throat is awful. It's been clogged with mucus for months. It gets sore, swollen, and scratchy with my attempts to clear or swallow mucus and there is no solution yet. Today it didn't matter how much I hydrated, how humid I kept my apartment, what I ate, nothing. I've been tested for Covid three times in the last two months out of concern about this, including for Christmas, and it's been negative every time.

I keep trying to do an experiment where I eat to satiety without binging, but I always end up stopping way before I'm full because I go beyond what my calorie needs for the day should be. The other day I ate over 3000 calories worth of salad, veggies, fruit, chicken and eggs in the first half of the day, only to the point of mild fullness, and then was still extremely hungry the rest of the day. Eating 2000 calories in a day feels the same to me as extreme restriction does, because either way, I'm spending the majority of the day so extremely hungry. Literally the only time I ever feel full is after a binge. There have been so many times this week where I have wanted to binge for no other reason than to just not feel this extreme hunger for a little while (I've resisted the binging urges so far though, which is good...making progress maybe?). I also feel exhausted in the same way I feel when I'm restricting and/or purging, which is utter BS, because my body should be able to function just fine on 2000 calories regardless of whether or not I'm still hungry. 

Anyone have any tips on how to combat this extreme hunger? Am I just going to have to deal with being hungry all the time for the rest of my life?"

I'm an almost 17 years old girl and i've been trying to recover from bulimia for a while now. I started making myself throw up at around 13, and stopped at 15 once my parents found out about this. Ever since I have not tried to make myself throw up. However, about 5-6 months ago now, I started feeling so very nauseous after eating, mostly around dinnertime, and I just ended up throwing up without intending it to happen. It wasn‚Äôt frequent, but started happening much more frequently (around 2-3 times per week) and now im nearly throwing up every single day. I feel so nauseous that I start seeing black and then I throw up. I've told my parents about seeing a doctor before, but they just get angry at me and insist im not trying hard enough. Im really scared and worried because there‚Äôs really no way I can stop it from happening; It's almost automatic now. 

For background information, I'm 166cms tall and the last time I was allowed to weigh myself, around 3 months ago, I was 51kgs. My lowest weight was 48kgs. I do ballet on a regular basis and I'm anemic. I'm having 3 meals a day.

My partner sent me a message, while I‚Äôm really happy she felt comfortable enough to share such a personal thing with me so openly, she feels as if another wave of Bulimia is coming, and that she‚Äôs hyper fixating on parts of her body.

I‚Äôm making this post because I want to help, and I thought of no other place to seek advice from than people who have experienced such a thing. I‚Äôve asked what I can do for her cause truthfully I‚Äôll do anything to ensure she thinks of herself as beautiful as I see her, or anywhere close. Her response was that she‚Äôs never opened up about this to anyone, and that she wouldn‚Äôt really know.

To get to the point, I want her to view herself, face, personality and body the same way I do - perfection. I‚Äôm unsure as to what I can do. I give her compliments out of genuine urges, yet I shy away from showering her with compliments as she might think they‚Äôll stop if she puts on the slightest amount of weight or lose any weight, which is one of the last things I want.

I know my case isnt bad, ive never even seen any blood in my vomit i just needed to ask because its stressing me out.
Thanks.

Edit: Theres no pain, no difficulty swallowing as far as i can tell and it doesnt flair up when i eat or anything. I know this isn‚Äôt a big deal compared to what some of you guys suffer through so i hope this doesnt sound like im calling for sympathy. Just needed to talk about it with someone."

So many of us will always have the thinking that it will not happen to us, that we won't be the one who suffer from complications, we won't be the one that have to face the consequences of our actions, we won't be the one that will suffer physically. 

Guess what? Yesterday I had another binge and purge episode after restricting for so long and I purged significant amount of bright red blood out. And my stupid ass still didn't want to go to the hospital until my dad screamed at me. 

It really can happen to anyone, at anytime. You will think that you are immune. You won't be the one who suffers a tear in your esophagus, you won't be the one ending up in a hospital. But guess what, your body will call it quits. Your body will FORCE YOU TO REST BECAUSE IT CANNOT TAKE THE STRESS YOU GIVE IT.

The place I'm in with my ED is like this: sure, I wish I didn't have it. I wish I had a normal relationship with food and my body. I wish I could eat intuitively. I know this disordered way of eating is not healthy or sustainable, and is in fact doing massive damage to my physical and mental health. Part of me wants to get help and recover. 

But the other part of me doesn't. I still like the euphoria that comes with binging, the ""quick fix"" of purging, the feeling of control and weight loss that comes with restricting, the way excessive exercise ""allows"" me to eat more - I'm still attached to all of it, and I don't feel like I can give it up. 

I keep thinking I've hit the so-called ""rock bottom."" I've binged to the point of extreme pain, purged until I've cried, restricted until I don't have the energy to walk. I've hit all the popular low points; eating food out of the trash, cancelling plans because I might have to eat in front of people, making a huge mess while purging, having a full on panic attack because I accidently miscalculated the calories of something I already ate.  I've had so many moments where the thought ""this is pathetic, I really need to get help"" has entered my mind, but it never lasts long enough for me to follow through. 

Have I just not hit my true rock bottom? Is that even necessary to get to the point of truly wanting to recover? For those of you who have made the leap to actually seeking recovery, what made the want for recovery more appealing than the security/comfort/etc of your ED?"

I know that's not how all binges are, but at least for me, that's how at least a third of them start. 

But I also deal with the all or nothing mentality in regards to restriction. Basically, I feel hungry ALL the time, and it's the same amount of hunger when I eat nothing/very little as when I eat a standard daily amount (yes, even if it's foods that should be satiating in theory). Like, I'll eat a nutritious meal that's high in fiber and protein and micronutrients and includes a serving of veggies and/or fruit and by all accounts should have me physically satisfied for the next few hours, but instead 5-10 minutes later I'm just as hungry as I was before the meal.  

So in my head it's like, if I'm going to have to suffer through hunger anyway, may as well eat 500 calories instead of 2000, right?"

I‚Äôm also a graduated medical student and an amateur writer in my free time. A few months ago, I started a new novel where one of the main characters is struggling with bulimia. It‚Äôs helping me cope as well as I get to express how I feel and what I‚Äôve been through, and how I wish things would have been. I also hope to raise awareness and help those struggling feel less alone. 

There‚Äôs only so much I know from my own eating disorder perspective and my medical knowledge, and I know everyone has their own story. The main issue is that I don‚Äôt won‚Äôt to write stuff that is highly unrealistic or exaggerated like I‚Äôve seen many people do on tv and many books.

My main problem issue is in regards to dating and sex. In my case, many times, hating how my body looked mudded up the whole experience to me. I didn‚Äôt want to see my friends, and even if I had a boyfriend for a short period of time, I was really uncomfortable showing my body or even trusting him that much. 

In my character‚Äôs case, not only does she have a distorted perception of her body, and purges because of regret after binges and wanting to keep her weight in check. But also, she sees vomiting as a way of dispelling the pressure and stress bottling up inside of her for weeks. Kind of like firing a gun. Her friends know about it, and she wants to get better. She also has a friend/love interest and I intend for them to get closer.

From your own personal experience, have you ever broken past the psychological barrier and been able to date/keep an already-existing relationship going? Would you rather focus on your own recovery process before trying? Have you had any struggles with sex and did you want to have it but I ended up freaking out? 

I know this question is very personal, but I genuinely want to do justice to how eating disorders really work. 

Thanks in advance. Your personal experience/advice will be really helpful. And if you need to talk about your personal struggle, I‚Äôm here to give you a hand if I may."

You still feel full and you know you'll be shitting it out for the next four days. It's been really bad for the last week. Ever since i had a car accident.. And i think i have an unrelated  health issue i don't even want to say out loud.  It hurts. 

I'm so sick of having to calm myself down.

This is my first post.


I'm Ira(17F) and i have a friend with ED, specifically- bulimia.



I was just told this year, but she said that it had gone away, so i didn't give it much thought. She is kind of chubby so i thought she was over it. I always tried to steer the conversation away if any of our other friends  made comments or asked questions, but that's it.


However, last week she had a mini brake down because her parents packed too much food for her lunch.

She hates throwing food away, so even though I offered to give her a fruit or something, and for her to throw what her parents packed away, she refused and forced herself to finish it, even though in her mind it was super greasy and fatty and just all around terrible. I felt bad I couldn't do more to help.


I asked if this was related to her issue, and she confessed it had gotten worse lately. She suffers from anxiety attacks from time to time so she is prone to having meltdowns once she's really stressed- not to mention she's on some hormone pills and that she's been told that those will bloat her and make her gain even more weight-.


And that all came to a head that days with Christmas coming around. 

She told me her family cooks a LOT during this season.
It doesn't help that they don't even cook healthy stuff, but very buttery and heavy things instead.


It's being hard for her, and i don't know what to do.



She can't even talk to her parents cause while they discovered her problem a few years ago(heard her throwing up, and understood the signs cause their other daughter also had bulimia) and now keep a very heavy eye on her...they don't believe in mental health. They think it's all bogus and it makes them nervous.

Every time she tries to mention it, they just change the direction of the conversation, acting as if nothing happened in the first place. 

They force her to eat, which, i guess in a way is good, but shouldn't they try and make things that are more digestible to her?


You know- vegetables, salads?
Fulfilling meals that don't make you feel too heavy??


I asked if she could cook for herself but she told me her parents would get angry and feel insulted if she didn't want to eat their cooking.

I'm just...so angry???
If your daughter is having meltdowns, fucking DO something.

Or if you're going to sit on your ass and do fuck all, at least let her help herself???? But no. Her taking the initiative to help herself is also a stain on your family, for whatever reason.






I've never had ED before- i find it very easy to both lose and gain weight, and I'm pretty happy with my body- so i have no experiences to fall back on and help her with.



Is there anything I can do?
And what's the best way one should handle these things?
Am i in the wrong for thinking her parents should make more accommodating meals instead?






Also: i came up with an excuse for her. She's gonna move out next year for university life, so it would be wise for her to learn how to cook for herself next year. 

I'll send her a list of healthy foods and recipes under the guise for that(that's way she can say it's a friend's idea and show her phone as proof- just in case the father gets mad and doesn't believe her) and meanwhile she can start cooking.





Do you guys have any recipes? That are nutritional but don't feel heavy? Or any other tips?



That's.... all for now, thank you for reading."

I think this is because I have just been looking for ways to control myself and one of the issues I knew I needed to wrangle under control was how often I binged.

I would buy whole sleeves of digestives (a type of biscuit/cookie basically) and eat them all in one sitting, I would buy giant boxes of cereal and eat several bowls in a few hours, I was just eating because it felt good and I was looking for a way of getting that under control and it led to me thinking of purging.

I knew that was a problem though, I knew about long term health risks and to stop that I started just chewing food and spitting it out. This let me ""binge"" without actually gaining any weight, and without having to vomit all the time either. It seemed like a win-win situation, no health risks and it got my binge eating under control.

But it turns out c/s has some health risks too, chewing signals your stomach to release more acid, and not swallowing means that acid has no food to digest and can cause things like stomach ulcers and shit if continued. I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure how to stop or control this anymore, it feels like every solution there is either doesn't work or comes with significant health risks. I mean, c/s is better than purging by far but I still end up purging if I must eat in a social setting and have no way to c/s. Does anyone else do this sort of thing?"

It‚Äôs hard to say how often, I know I‚Äôve gone weeks maybe months without but as far as I can recently recall, it‚Äôs a few times a week, and sometimes multiple times a day a few times a week, most weeks. 

I‚Äôve always told myself it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and it‚Äôs always the last time and that it was just a secret tool I had in my back pocket to stay a certain weight or a friend when Im depressed - but I‚Äôm starting to feel like it‚Äôs worse than I‚Äôm admitting to myself. 

I‚Äôve thrown up at work, I‚Äôve thrown up at family functions, I‚Äôve thrown up immediately after eating and hours later and sometimes rush home to try to get it out, I‚Äôve thrown up while traveling, I‚Äôve thrown up blood, and mostly it‚Äôs just me bingeing and purging in my own apartment. 

I would never have identified myself with an eating disorder, and was sure I had this under control. But I recently wrote in my gratitude journal that the one thing I was thankful for one day was that I didn‚Äôt  throw up. 

I had an intake call with a therapist from the Emily program on Monday. She recommended me to residential treatment and asked what more it‚Äôs going to take for me to admit I am sick. 

Since then Ive been very confused because I swore she was going to tell me I was a mild case. I can‚Äôt stop wondering is the therapist jumping to conclusions, am I capable of stopping this outside of residential treatment, did I misspeak and make it seem worse than it was? 

I‚Äôve also been convinced that I can stop since this call on Monday - that I‚Äôm actually magically healed there‚Äôs no need for something as intense as four plus weeks in residential treatment and I am a mild case. I genuinely said wow now that I‚Äôve admitted it I think it‚Äôs gone! 

But then today I binged and threw up again. And I am struggling so badly right now with hunger and sadness and fear of eating. I am so afraid I‚Äôm going to binge and purge again tonight. 

I keep thinking if I read the right books or just work out regularly or get good sleep and eat healthy foods I‚Äôll stop doing this and this feeling will go away - but I‚Äôve done those things and yes it leads to days or weeks I‚Äôm doing great, but here I am again looking myself in the mirror wiping my mouth clean and seeing my bloodshot eyes. 

Does anyone have input? Do you think residential treatment could actually be warranted? Or is it overkill? I‚Äôd have to take fmla leave and I‚Äôm in a corporate leadership position - it‚Äôd be so much ‚Äúeasier‚Äù and cheaper to work on this another way. 

Thank you so much for reading."

I am purging like ten times a week, lost over twenty pounds in two months (although I am still on the higher end of normal BMI), and despite the fact I am used to this considering its been going on for over ten years, even I am becoming worried. 

I am looking over all my resources again. I do have an option to go to daily treatment center or to get hospitalized, both for free, I'll get medical leave from work, my bf is okay with it, the only downside is the waiting list which I would be on for like two months. 

It's just...I've been there two times already (to both the daily treament and hospitalization) and while it helped for several months, I always relapsed. 

It feels kinda pointless to put my life on hold again for something that failed twice already. I know third time's is a charm, but, like...i feel discouraged and I'd rather just let this go on and see where it takes me. Sounds morbid.

Another thing is that I am ashamed to be going for the third time already with no visible progress. It's like spitting into doctor's faces. 


My head is a mess right now - I keep going over the email I wrote out to them, contemplating if I should send it.

She was very gracious about it but she only sees me as a friend is already in a relationship. 

I suddenly don't want to purge anymore, because binging never made me happy and the only point in me binging was to purge later. It basically gave me the same end goal as starving: fainting. 

It's a weird (not to mention harmful) coping mechanism because all I really wanted to do was escape the numbness i was feeling even if no one else notices. That numbness is something I've known ever since my depression (which I'm currently taking Prozac for) began as a child.

I think I'm just waiting for things to get worse because my ED could finally screw things up if my weight gets critical enough. My first ED symptom was restricting and despite my on-and-off purging i always go back to it. But I really can't bear food anymore. No matter what eating issue consumes me I'll always be afraid of it.

In my heart I know I'm just replacing one bad coping mechanism with another and I never had control whether I was purging or restricting. 

I'm so tired of feeling this way but I feel like I need to let things get worse instead of panicking before it even gets dangerous. 

I think with purging it's different. You know you're sick. You can feel it. But with starving and restricting nothing is ever enough. I don't know if I'll ever be enough for anyone, including myself. I think that's why I'm going back to it. Like if I let myself get worse this way, I'll feel something. I'll feel like a version of me I truly like."

I'm stressed because of school but also because of Christmas coming up. Christmas to me is a vulnerable time. It reminds me of my childhood and the people I love. I have always loved Christmas. I love the magic, the traditions, being with grandparents... everything. 
But my grandparents (who I love more than anything) are getting older and sick which makes Christmas a vulnerable time. 

Having bulimia is hard. But I find it even harder because of Christmas. I want Christmas to be amazing and live up to every expectation, but instead, I'm having an eating disorder that makes me focus on food and my body all the time. 

I feel so stupid and guilty for hating my body, constantly body checking, and purging food when there are so much more important things in the world than how much I weigh. 

In some ways Christmas makes me want to recover because I'm constantly reminded of how life used to be. But in other ways, it's just really really hard and my bulimia is just thriving at the moment. 

I just wanted to share some thoughts. Maybe some of you guys can relate? 

How do u guys feel about Christmas?"

Hey everyone, first time poster here. With Christmas coming up, this is potentially a very stressful time for people who suffer from BED, and I was looking for some advice/solace. On my quest to get better with my binge eating, I‚Äôve started to allow myself indulgences more frequently, and I‚Äôve also been eating a bit more as a result, which is fine (I‚Äôm still tracking calories and working out regularly). Anyway, on previous holidays or any social events where I‚Äôm around tons and tons of deliciousness that I usually don‚Äôt eat on my own (pizza, alcohol, cakes, etc) I feel as if I need to eat as much as I can while I‚Äôm there, since I won‚Äôt be able to on other days. Does anyone have any anecdotal advice in how to conquer this feeling, and eat normally, while still indulging, on holidays?"

In a few weeks I‚Äôm gonna go on holiday with one of my closest friends who I haven‚Äôt seen in person in years. We met in uni almost a decade ago and back then she wasn‚Äôt struggling with bulimia. She ended up developing an ED after an abusive relationship and she‚Äôs struggled with bulimia and binge-eating ever since. 

While I‚Äôm super excited to finally be reunited, I‚Äôm also a bit apprehensive in terms of eating around her. Back when we lived together in uni, our favourite past time was to buy a bunch of junk food, alcohol and spend evenings just talking about life while stuffing ourselves. In anticipation of our reunion, we‚Äôve discussed doing exactly this again because we both remember it fondly, but I‚Äôm wondering if repeating these habits will be harmful for her now that she has an eating disorder. 

In addition to this, I‚Äôve also started doing IF for almost a year now. I read multiple articles on how IF isn‚Äôt recommended for people who struggle with eating disorders, so I‚Äôm wondering if me continuing to stick to this diet around her might be a trigger for her, especially if she‚Äôd be eating alone during periods where I‚Äôm in my fasting window. 

I‚Äôm asking all this here because she‚Äôs the kind of person who hates inconveniencing others so I fear that, if I ask her about this directly, she won‚Äôt be honest with me because she doesn‚Äôt wanna be a burden. 

So yeah, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

The weird part of it is I feel completely and totally okay after purging.

I'm no longer dizzy with emotions or worries and I don't want to eat anymore.

I'm currently 24f and this happened back in June of 2019, when I was 21.

I got sick, like really sick. For over a week I could not eat anything and keep it down. I mean immediately my body would reject it, even water sometimes. Before this I had never binged or purged, I had never though about doing it. Something changed that week and the ones following it while I was recovering. When I got sick, my entire family was away and I was supposed to join them in a few days. It's hard to get hold of your mom at the best of times, but it really sucks when you feel like you're dying and she is in the middle of nowhere Wyoming with zero cell service. 

Eventually I got through, moved my flight back a few more days, but I was still virtually alone. Most of my high school friends weren't in town that summer and my boyfriend was in Dallas with his family. No one was there to tell me not to just eat what I wanted and as much of it as I could to just try and get something to stick or at least enjoy the flavor.  I was already uncontrollably purging....why shouldn't I binge?

While this was happening, my cell phone crapped out and, with no one around to help me out, I had to go get it fixed by myself. Because I was still sick, I learned how to vomit in public while I waited to pick it up. After this I went to a 24 hour clinic where I spent 2-3 hours alone, at 11 pm, getting blood work and IVs. If you haven't had a potassium IV, don't it it sucks. I had two. The next day (or the one after I don't remember) I went to my regular doctor. I learned nothing, got no medication, and had to get on a plane, still recovering. I learned how to throw up in an airport too. 

The cherry on top was my flight into Denver was late, so I missed my connecting flight. There I am, alone, Denver airport, 11 PM desperately trying to find a hotel room. Thankfully I did, but boy it was horrible. 

The next semester at school, I found myself binging and purging again when my boyfriend shared some hard to swallow information. I have no idea what I had those couple of weeks, but I'm still struggling with eating and I don't know how to tell anyone.

I will continue the miss the addiction, and ruminate over how my day would go if I did it again with no consequence. Though it‚Äôs only thoughts, I can think about it without being compelled to do it anymore.

Alas, I‚Äôve chosen to feel good long term, to have better health, and to feel more balanced over short term pleasure. And it was hard, I have had many slip ups, and who knows.. I could have more in the future though I won‚Äôt predict that for me. 

I am 5 weeks clean as of yesterday, aiming for a personal goal of 2 months but for the rest of my life being the ultimate goal.

In fact, this is my first post ever to Reddit. What's inspired me to talk is seeing how this community tries so hard to take care of each other. It touches me in my soul.
I guess I'm pretty much a lifer now w/my Bulimia, although it comes & goes. I started throwing up in my late teens & am now in my 40s. I have gone thru several stages of attaining my perfect weight, then gaining it back, then repeating the process. I feel so high all the time during my ""perfect phases"". They can last for months or yrs sometimes.
I thought I'd be free of my ED by now. At 20, my dad put me in rehab for 10 wks (my fam thinks i fully recovered at this point), with lots of after-therapy, but the deal is, if you have this thing, you have it.... its never left me & i know now that it won't. Its always right under the surface. 

The worst effects i have are numerous false teeth ($$$ ugh!) & an acid reflux of epic proportions. And of course, there's the scars on my psyche. I love sex, but its always hard to feel confident enough in my own body to relax enough & enjoy it. I think this is where i robbed myself the most. I am always yearning to feel GOOD in my own skin. Sex, love, & relationships have all suffered so much because of my ED & warped body perceptions..

I wish I'd had a community like this back when i started, but they just didn't exist. A place to talk about all the technical details of binging & purging was exactly what i needed then, so I think what y'all are doing here is amazing. Its free of judgement & supportive at the same time. 
I haven't shared like this with a group in over 20 yrs....irl, my secret continues, so thank you for letting me give you a piece of my story."

When she found out, she said that she wouldn't force me to eat anything, and she said that she trusted me to eat enough and keep it down if I were to go through with recovery (recovery hasn't been going great btw)

In the last 3ish years, my mom and I have rarely ever ate meals together anymore because of my eating disorder, she usually just eats without me. Well, today, I asked if we could cook something together and I asked if we could eat together. 

We ended up cooking some seasoned prawns and bell peppers, a quinoa recipe that was similar to yellow rice but with quinoa instead of rice, and green beans. My mom let me serve myself and I filled my whole plate, I felt comfortable eating at first because everything was at least healthy. I sat down at the table where she was (she had me get my plate first) and she looked at me funny,

she just said ""That's a lot of food, are you sure you'll be able to eat all of that?"".  I was already really upset at that point, and I said ""I think so, I haven't eaten anything else today.""  She just grabbed my plate from me and she walked back into the kitchen, she was like ""No, that's way too much food, I don't want you to be uncomfortable"".  She put back most of the prawns and quinoa, I mostly just had green beans left over.  I was feeling really hurt, and I ended up only eating about half of what she gave me because I thought she might judge me

I really wish I could tell her how I feel but I know that would only cause problems between us. Whenever I start talking about my eating disorder, she either 1) tries to change the subject because she's uncomfortable, 2) starts freaking out and asking what she did wrong as a parent for me to end up like this, or 3) if she's in a really silly goofy mood, which is actually a majority of the time, she'll just get angry at me and tell me that my eating disorder is stupid and she'll say the classic 'just eat, it's not that hard'. I just really don't have the energy for it right now. I also can't really talk to my therapist about what happened because she doesn't feel comfortable when I talk about my eating disorder, since she's never received training about eating disorders 

I just kinda escaped to my room and now I'm just laying in bed, I really don't want to see my mom right now and I might just lay in here for the rest of the day. I don't want to see my body right now so I'm laying under all of my blankets"

Sometimes the toilet water splashes into my eye and makes it swell shut for an hour. Sometimes I throw up in public and lie to the concerned strangers who overhear my performance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sick enough‚Äù I tell myself as I pick at the vomit and analyze a suspicious red substance: is this a berry I ate earlier, or did I cough up a blood clot? It‚Äôs a berry. Resume the gagging.

 May - July fell into a binge restrict cycle whilst experiencing extreme hunger due too heavy restriction for about 5 months. 

then Aug - Dec fell again into a mix of v low restriction, b/p, over exercise all, eating maintenence. all of it id experienced Until December.

But now for the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is fail restriction & basically binge, only purg!ng a little, a few times. 

ive probs been eating around maintenance, but still mainly vegan- ignoring timings and not rly measuring any food or cal counting which i feel so guilty for loosing even more control.  

my body is disgusting, im more depressed than ive ever been but i dont think thats soley from my ED; although the depression is fuelling it. 

 ive been ignoring my body and how it looks, not weighing or stressing over it only stressing over the loss of control and 'discipline' and my ed 'disappearing'.
 
now i feel like all im doing is eating & have little desire too restrict - waiting until its all too much & i can see again how quickly i can loose it all and get back too my lw. 

so uncomfortable with everything neither option seems appealing i keep telling myself if i reach below my lw by 31 jan (my bday) i can get help.

 i feel like i need too just get bored of eating and b repulsed by it until i can hardcore restrict again. i don't want to recover but i'm holding hope that by mid next year i will have gotten much much worse so maybe i can start then. ik u shouldn't wait till that point but i cant imagine rn wanting too let go of this life ever. 

i just want too shrivel & wither away. be left alone too starve w no responsibility for anything outside of existing. i hate this life. pissed i cant restrict as well as i used too and even more uncomfortable that part of me doesnt want too right now.  fml"

So I stocked up on meat and cheese and a bunch of essentials.

I did binge on a pack of cheese, 4 icecreams,2 blocks of chocolate, an entire packet of pasta with garlic and more cheese. I think that's all I ate. I wrote it down somewhere so I could calculate the calories later.

But I don't feel like I want to. I think I won't even have time to binge again until Saturday and then the following Monday 

But seriously pray for me. Realistically I have enough food to not need to entire a supermarket for about three weeks. (Well apart.from chocolate and a few little bits and pieces.)  This would have been undo-able a year ago. It would easily all be long gone in a few days.

I moved out of this awful sharehouse (the girl was trying to hassle me for thousands of dollars that she wasn't entitled to and wasn't agreed to it was meant to be first of the month$700. Follow the rules end of story, on top of the house being filthy and mouldy and surrounded by vermin and horrendous traffic and her yelling down the phone all day long) and back to my own house and the one upside was not feeling compelled to binge on groceries since she was around or out of tiredness because I had just made a long commute.

I have found being back to work has given me less time to binge and purge but I have noticed the magnitude when I do sky rocket."

I had 3 boxes of wafers I bought to have for a week as I am sick and stuck in my house to have with my tea and my sister straight up 6 PACKS OF THAT THING (half of everything I had for a week) with a whole box of cereal and she still wanted a sandwich with chocolate milk.

But somehow she is still losing weight? 

She doesn't smell like vomit and she doesn't take up time in the bathroom, her teeth are white and she's mostly never home so I dont know what she's doing.

I asked her if she's purging and she got very angry with me asking and beside denying it she yelled that it's none of my business and that I am disgusting for asking.

Maybe she isnt doing anything but she eats things that were meant to last for a 5 member family and we cant afford the amount of food she eats continuously.

I started hiding my food in my room because a weeklong supply ends in less than a day here..

She had anorexia in the past and was treated in a hospital before recovering to normal weight.

She's modeling for a loving which is why I'm concerned she's harming herself for her career..

Hoe can I tell if she's harming herself? She doesn't seem like she vomits but she eats inhuman amounts of food while still losing weight. I'm really confused and scared for her as she gets very angry when you ask about it.

What do I do? She's 17."

So for context: at the beginning of this year, I was nearly 190 pounds (at 5'5). I've struggled with weight since elementary school, and have had a lot of weight fluctuations throughout the years, though I have always bounced between slightly heavier than average to straight up obese. My heaviest was just under 200 pounds. 

Spring of this year, I began a routine of heavily restricting and exercising daily. This resulted in a pretty dramatic weight loss (down to 134 was my lowest weight, last month). This was met with nothing but overwhelming praise and congratulations from anyone who knew me when I was fat. No one suspects anorexia unless you were already thin to begin with. Nevermind the hair loss, ghost-like face, or any other tip-offs - as long as you're skinny now, people consider it an improvement. Not that I would consider my ED to be anorexia, considering recent developments (and I have never been officially diagnosed). 

A couple weeks ago, series of life events that happened all at once triggered the start of a b/p cycle for me. Massive binges, followed by purging as close to all of it as I could possibly get, every single night, for just over a week. I was shocked at how quickly I got addicted to it, especially since I thought I had solid ""willpower"" from so many months of restriction. I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with how devastating it was (is). The mental, physical, and emotional toll it was taking on me in just 1 week was so much more than the months of restriction (at least, that's what it felt like to me). I had no energy, I got dizzy often, I couldn't sleep. I even developed a noticeable stutter, which I definitely didn't have before. I felt like my brain was only half functioning. 

Only after a night where I binged to such an extent that the only reason I didn't purge was because I was physically unable to move, and was stuck crying on the floor in intense pain, did I decide to open up to someone. I chose my mom, for a number of reasons; she is one of the only people I still talk to outside of work following these triggering life events, I was going to be around her for the following week so I thought maybe telling her would make me unable to have an opportunity to b/p, AND she herself has dealt with b/p in the past. 

Her reaction was less than ideal, to say the least. She was frustrated with me, and her initial advice, predictably, was to ""just stop."" When I tried to explain to her that I wanted to, of course I wanted to, but it felt impossible, and I didn't know how, she instead made a ""game plan"" - one that involved getting back on track with restriction. 

The following week really sucked. I didn't binge or purge, which should feel like a victory, but it doesn't. She commented on every single thing I would eat, discouraged me from eating, constantly said I should stick to eating only fruits and vegetables, all the while she was eating snacks/sweets. 

The worst moment was when we were in a cafe for lunch, and I hadn't eaten breakfast that morning or dinner the night before. She literally took the food out of my hand and put it back in the bag, saying I could eat it later when I decided if I was ""actually hungry."" I tried to tell her, in the least confrontational way possible, that her method of preventing me from binging was upsetting to me, and she got defensive, saying ""I thought you wanted me to help?""

Another not fun moment was going with her to her house last night, and seeing a counter full of junk food. She made sure to announce to the rest of the household, ""we have to hide this junk food from [my name]. She's skinny now and we don't want to ruin it.""

Today, I'm on my own again. I haven't binged or purged, nor do I feel the urge to (I think...). In fact, I think I'm back in the restricting mindset, for better or for worse. But after opening the floodgates of b/p, it feels like it's looming in the background as a possibility now, waiting for the tiniest slip-up in my restriction. 

I thought I was taking a positive step. Now I feel more than ever like there is no escape from this ED cycle I've found myself in. 

I know this is mostly a ramble/rant, but if any of you have dealt with something similar, I would appreciate any words you have to share."

I may have ruined my health.,13,2,1639245090.0,"I'm 29 years old and first started with bulimic behaviour all the way back in 2011 when I was 18. So I've been bulimic for roughly a decade.

My bulimia has been in ok phases and really bad ones. At my worst I was doing it daily, multiple times after literally everything I ate. Since last year, I've been averaging a few times (like 7) a month.

I've had shocks in the past. I had extremely bad acid reflux years ago and got prescribed something from the doc. I've had a big adult tooth pulled out because of my bulimia. 

But these past few months I've had a bit of a bigger shock and wake up call. I'm scared I've fucked my health permanently and despite sometimes saying I want to die, I really don't think I do and when it feels real, I realise how much I want to live. 

I purged around a month ago and a few days later developed a really bad chest and throat infection. I've never been that ill. Night sweats, high fever, extreme cough that would make me see white dots in my eyes from the straining. Been prescribed 3 different antibiotics by the doctor since then and whilst I feel mostly better, my tonsils are still enlarged and looking extremely abnormal and I still have a sore throat.

I'm terrified of hospitals so am getting a bit too scared to ring the doc again incase they say I need to get tests (which is dumb logic, because surely it'd be better to sort it out than let it progress, whatever it is) but now I'm thinking what if it's throat cancer. I have a ten year history with bulimia so I don't think this is that far out there.

I'm scared, but incredibly have completely stopped with the bulimia (minus 1 relapse). This is the longest I've gone in so long. 

I suppose what I'm trying to say is this behaviour is so dangerous and abnormal it WILL catch up with you at some point. The body is not made to cope with this."
re4ofd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/re4ofd/trying_something_counterintuitive/,Trying something counterintuitive,2,0,1639244396.0,"***First off;*** *I have already contacted an eating disorder unit for help, and am currently waiting to hear back from them. I know I need professional help, so there is no need to point that out.*

A bit of background;

32 year old student, recovering drug addict (currently 14 months clean) and on the fast track towards full blown bulimia. Used to B/P once or twice a month for the last year or so, lately it¬¥s been escalating to 1-2 days/week, and often 2-3 times in a row when it happens.

Been trying all the usual advice; keeping my blood sugar stable, 5 meals/day, intuitive eating, avoiding restrictive behaviours, no over exercising etc, but if anything this has only made things worse. I am a student of sports science and have a very genuine interest in health and fitness, and I am a very abitious person who like to strive for high goals. if I don¬¥t set strong goals and lifestyle rules regarding my diet and exercising I just have no motivation to not B/P at all.

What¬¥s further more is that I don¬¥t really fit into the ""normal"" model of bulimia; I have no bodily obsession, I¬¥ve never over exercised in an unhealthy way, I have no feelings of shame regarding my body, I don¬¥t feel bad when I eat, my self esteem is fine etc. Basically I am a regular, normally functioning fitness enthusiast in between my B/P cycles. Which has led me to believe that my bulimia is actually an atypical expression if my addiction and my deeply complicated relationship with dopamine. This would also make sense given that my binge cravings, and thought patterns regarding them, expresses themselves in ways that is strikingly similar to my drug cravings.

When I put this all together, along with the fact that my way of recovering from my drug addiction has been to find dopamine through progress by working towards high goals, I have decided to try something radical. I am going to go all in on my health and fitness interest, my love for discipline, and my fondness for tough challenges, by doing the ""75 hard"". This would be an absolutely horrible idea for most people with an ED (and even for people in general since 75 hard really isn¬¥t sustainable unless you are a pretty serious athlete). Extreme exercising, restrictive behaviours and a strong focus on bodily image is exactly what ought to be avoided in most cases. But like I said, I do actually have a logical reasoning for why I am trying this. And either way, I really have nothing to lose by trying, given that what I am currently doing isn¬¥t working, and I am already headed at full speed in a very dangerous direction. I am well aware that this most likely won¬¥t work out well, but I might as well explore every option while I wait for professional help.

So why am I writing this? Well, I live alone in a small city where I don¬¥t know anyone, and I am highly introverted, so I really have no one else to talk to. Venting it on the internet to a bunch of anonymous strangers probably isn¬¥t going to do much difference, but at least it¬¥s better than keeping it all inside by myself..."

Last year in December 2020, I did an exercise with my mental health nurse where I had to write two letters to myself. The first had to describe what life would be like in one year‚Äôs time if I didn‚Äôt recover, and the second was for if I did recover. 

I was not able to complete the exercise, and it‚Äôs difficult to say which one was more painful to try. At the time of writing the first letter, it was a few weeks before Christmas and I was terrified of going through the festive season with an eating disorder. I was still weighing myself every day, sometimes more than four times per day. I was unable to focus on university, friends or family, as I was constantly overwhelmed with anxious racing thoughts about my weight and appearance, and about how much I was eating. Because I had been restricting and living in weight suppression for so long - many years of my life at this point - I lived in constant fear of everything related to food and losing control around food. I was restricting my calories down to tiny amounts and having horrible binging and purging episodes. My legs, ankles and face were constantly swollen from the dehydration from purging. My throat was always sore and sometimes bleeding from repeated vomiting, and my hands were dry and sore from all the stomach acid. My entire body felt awful because of poor nutrition from restriction. I couldn‚Äôt get my period properly and I was always too cold. I frequently felt dizzy and faint from electrolyte imbalance and had chest pain. I was in so much pain emotionally and so miserable, but at that time my eating disorder was pretty much the only thing that gave me comfort and a sense of achievement. It trapped me because I used it to cope with pain, but it got worse and worse and I needed to cope with the additional pain it brought me. 

I broke down in tears trying to think about what it would be like next Christmas (2021): I knew it would be bad at the time and felt so helpless against my eating disorder that it would only be worse in a year‚Äôs time. 

It also brought me to tears trying to write the second letter, because I simply couldn‚Äôt imagine being recovered. I had been suffering for so long that I didn‚Äôt feel as though there was a single part of me that believed I could recover. I genuinely didn‚Äôt know how I could change and the idea of never using eating disorder behaviours again (purging, restricting, compulsive exercise‚Ä¶) seemed impossible. I was sometimes suicidal because I couldn‚Äôt see a way out.

If you relate to any of this, please keep reading. 

This isn‚Äôt meant to be a post about how I recovered exactly, but a way to mark for myself how far I‚Äôve come. I don‚Äôt anyone in my life who I can talk to about what happened in this much detail. I might have wanted to read something like this when I was at my lowest, though. 

Recovery is the best decision I have ever made, and every day I am grateful for it. My eating disorder took away my ability to see any beauty or find any joy in life because my brain didn‚Äôt have enough nourishment or rest to experience it. I know my relationship with food and my body image aren‚Äôt perfect, and I still struggle with my mental health as I did before my ED, but I am no longer trapped in the utter misery of this disease. 

I thought I could never do it and I did. If you think you can‚Äôt get better, I am telling you, YOU CAN! Happiness has taken on a new meaning for me now it is nothing to do with the calories in things or how much vomit I can bring up or how many grams I weigh. It is really sad, how long my life was dictated and ruined by things like this. 

Thinking now about this Christmas, I am genuinely excited to try the special Christmas food and drinks that come out in the shops in December. I can‚Äôt wait to share a lovely meal with my family on Christmas Day and I don‚Äôt give a single fuck how many calories are in it. I‚Äôm not scared of losing control around food because I trust my body and it trusts me to take care of it. 

Life isn‚Äôt easy - my depression gets a lot worse in winter and I have BPD which is difficult to manage - but it‚Äôs amazing. If you‚Äôre feeling trapped in your ED right now, please don‚Äôt lose hope - I can‚Äôt wait for you to experience life without it, and I know you can do it. 

Best wishes for the holidays üåü"

I'm currently trying to be b/p free (from 1.11. I have b/p just a few times, I mean really). However I'm having problems with my digestion. I feel how the food wants to come up and that it's just sitting in my stomach. 

I think it's a common thing for people trying to get out from this b/p hole. However how do you fight it? I just feel so uncomfortable but still happy that the food is still in my stomach. 

Do you have some advice? üêô TY in advance!"

This was originally waaaay longer but I got rid of most of it so I'm aorry if this reads like word vomit

I'm 19 and adulthood feels like impending doom, I know that the time had to come eventually but this just... scares me. I'm already technically an adult but things are actually starting now, my mom wants me out of the house and in college by springtime and I'm scared, I don't even fully know what I want to do in life yet but I also don't want to be selfish by staying home

The only things that make me happy anymore are spending time with my parents, painting, playing Splatoon 2 and watching Studio Ghibli movies. My parents have already said that no matter where I go, visitations will be nearly impossible due to my dad's health, our family's car issues and their schedules; as for the other things mentioned, I fear that I won't have time for those things anymore

My parents are truly my only friends and I've only had a tiny handful of other friends throughout my whole life. I'm afraid of putting myself out there due to my past of being bullied; I've been bullied for many things, my body, my teeth, my interests and generally just having annoying personality. Several of my friendships have ended simply due to my trauma dumping and that is fully my fault, they never signed up to be my source of happiness and even though I know understand that, I just don't trust myself enough not to do that to people. It seems so lonely. I'd still get to call my parents and stuff but they say that I'm not good at phone calls and they get annoyed with me, and sometimes they ignore my texts. The silver lining is that I could at least still talk to my therapist over the phone and such

As I already said, I don't even fully know what exactly I want to do, and I'm afraid of picking something that I would end up hating. They're all things that I have do interest in, but I'm afraid of picking a career path, enrolling in the classes and I find out the classes aren't good fits for me. I know that people can change their paths later in life, but I'm afraid of how long it'd be before then if I ever had to do that

I'm trying so hard to stay positive but it's so hard. I've had this eating disorder since I was 14, it sometimes feels like the only constant

I'm especially worried about the bullying over my body again if I go to college. I'm getting over a failed recovery attempt and even though I don't enjoy this disorder, it's so hard not to keep going back. I have a giant black poncho that I haven't been able to take off for around 3 months now, I can't stand to wear properly fitting clothes without it anymore. I couldn't handle the anxiety attacks in the shower anymore so I now shower with my eyes closed now, it helps the tiniest amount but it still barely helps, it's like putting a band aid on a stab wound. I can't really try to keep anything down without having a panic attack. I literally dream about my fear foods and it's so hard. Everything feels so slow when I try taking my mind off of this stupid disorder. Everything regarding my E.D has gotten worse over the last year

I fear that my E.D is going to be the only constant in my life once I start to move on by myself. I can't really picture a life without it and it's horrifying, it takes up so much of my mind and time; I almost look forward to it in a strange way, knowing that it could possibly be one of the only familiar things in my adult life. I hate living this way but I can't stand my body looking like this, I know that's bad to say but it's true, I feel like I'll eventually have nothing else in life. I hate the way I feel when I'm at rock bottom, I feel so dizzy and braindead, but it also stops the panic attacks and such during those times which hurts. I wish I could just wither away without putting in all of the time and pain 

This stupid sickness has made life feel so empty for me, I wish I could just die already. My mom freaks out and calls me selfish whenever I attempt so I wouldn't attempt again, but I just wish it could just happen normally to solve everyone's problems. I just wish I could pass away in my sleep, or get mauled by a bear, or something. I'm just in so much pain"

I got over it after roughly two years and did my best not to really think about weight at all since then. Though I gained a decent amount of weight due to my newer medications and can feel myself getting extremely self conscious, enough to the point where I start restricting for a day or two now. 

For context, I am an extremely short guy, only 5'3. Before my new meds and after getting over my original ED I weighed about 140lbs (which I was fine with). I currently am the heaviest I have ever been at 175lbs. I know about 10lbs of it is muscle gain but the rest is my stomach. I am aware enough that I am not bad looking but the analytic in me gets stuck on numbers. Things like BMI saying I am obese hits hard (even though I know that it is different for everyone and those dumb online calculators shouldn't be relied on, though my brain has trouble rationalizing).

My psychologist told me to calorie count and I did but it made it so much worse, I would end up getting sick because the low calorie keto whatever bs was two calories over my limit and I would starve the rest of the day after like 9am. I tried telling the doc and she told me, what I now think of as really bad advice, that starving a little isn't that bad and maybe would be helpful for me. 

I tried to exercise the most I can (again maybe going a little extreme) though I can't keep any weight off even with good food and exercise. My other doc told me it is most likely medication weight and I shouldn't worry about it. I know I shouldn't be ashamed, and you can't even tell I have extra weight under my thin hoodies but everytime I see it it really bothers me and Idk what to do anymore without possibly messing myself up.

Over the past year or so, I‚Äôve developed a sort of acid reflux. Bubbly drinks/seltzers cause it, working out causes it, even some foods will trigger it. 

I‚Äôm no doctor but I assume i‚Äôve damaged/weakend my upper esophageal sphincter, causing acid/food to come up often. I also assume that my gut and stomach function is just generally off. 

I‚Äôve started eating mainly whole foods and prebiotics in order to start to heal the stomach/gut biome, however I have no clue how to strengthen my sphincter. Did anyone else have these symptoms and were you able to get rid of it in recovery? If you did recover from it how long did it take? 

Every time I try to workout i start to burp acid and leftover lunch into my mouth and have to stop. I usually take pepto bismol or tums but they don‚Äôt help at all, which is why I assume it‚Äôs the sphincter. 

Any advice is much appreciated! I‚Äôm so enthusiastic about this round of recovery and want to start truly healing."

So had issues with food since I was 16yo. By 20yo my ED physically began in a 25 BMI body. Within the year, my BMI went down to 20, but I was still far from my goal. By 21 I met my partner who helped me recover. I got pregnant with my wonderful little one and after a while my ED seemed like a distant past. But a few months postpartum I stepped on the scale then looked in the mirror and my heart dropped. I gained 25 kg from my 20yo weight. This has brought my ED back, but because of me breastfeeding my little one, I knew I couldn't lose control. So I forced myself to restrict only, HOWEVER I could only restrict to the minimum healthy amount for a breastfeeding mother. So far I lost 12 kg, within 5 months which brings me almost back to where I started... But it's getting so hard because I really want to binge and purge again...

One issue I‚Äôm finding now is that because I want to tone up etc, I obviously need to focus on protein intake and all that stuff but now I‚Äôm finding that the thoughts are creeping back in because I‚Äôm having to focus on food so much and it‚Äôs obviously a bit restrictive.

My question is, has anyone had any positive experiences around going back to the gym in recovery? Is there a good way to navigate the whole ‚Äúhealthy eating‚Äù stuff like protein etc when in recovery? Any tips would be great.

There were times in my life when it got better and I had the feeling that I was over it, until the beginning of this year, when I started purging again because I was in an extremely terrible state of mind.
My boyfriend treated me really terrible and told me in a 2 page letter how terrible I was, so I started spiraling down into my bad habits again. On top of that, I got really depressed, so when I realized that I couldn‚Äôt cope with it on my own anymore, I texted my ‚Äûbest‚Äú friend. I told her about my boyfriend, how lonely and broken I was and that I started purging (again). All she knew about my ED History, was that I had serious struggles with anorexia when I was a young teenager. To protect myself (and I guess hide) I never told  her or anyone else, that I still had issues with my body image etc. So when I told her, she was extremely disgusted and didn‚Äôt have any nice things to say to me anymore to I guess encourage me ? She then told me to go to a psychologist and ever since then she never texted me again and never asked me how I was. This happened in June. She is a little overweight and has struggles with her body image too but she is extremely beautiful and kind hearted and I always felt so happy when I was around her. Did she maybe feel offended by me telling her about my ED when she herself fails to lose weight ? I honestly don‚Äòt consider her my friend anymore since that happened because she never checked in on me again and treated me like I was trash. My issue is that no one else in my life knows about my struggles and seeing her reaction scared me to ever tell anyone else. Currently I am in the best headspace I ever had and I have no more issues with it at all and I am so proud of my self but I still want to share those things with someone...

This post might be triggering and I apologize for that‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt know who to talk to. I really thought I was done throwing up. Haven‚Äôt done it in about 8 years unless im sick and just need to feel better. I had a realization that back when I would binge and purge the purging wasn‚Äôt just about weight control. I had no healthy ways of emotional regulation back then and my purging served as an emotional release and reset for me. Like being reborn honestly. And ever since then I realized how much I miss that feeling‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been eating more than usual recently and I think that has also been triggering me. But I was wondering if purging feels like that for anyone else?? Im honestly kinda worried I might relapse and I never thought I would get here. I thought I was done. Im scared and am finding myself wanting to restart something I thought was long gone despite knowing all the ways it harms me.

for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours & thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot/ or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged- but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. 

it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. ( the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much/ dont have the energy or just dont *care* enough tbh. ) 
 
The normal eating with little guilt (not because it was safe foods or id compensated- just genuinley alright w eating it ) only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. 

its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction,  trying too make it worse than last time. 
but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat/ feel normal for good- but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. 

its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it. 

 
idk. just feel so invalid and fake and undisciplined. is this even an ed. ugh"

I think I‚Äôve always struggled with ED, showing up in various forms, and had a short period of purging once before but it only lasted a month or so and then 2 years went by without doing it and I summed it up in my mind as just a ‚Äúphase‚Äù and thought it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. Well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been purging now for 8 months. It started off as intense restrictive dieting and only purging when I ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to. Then, the cravings started to intensify - makes sense- and so the purging increased to every weekend, Friday - Sunday.  (Mostly restrictive purging though. I had been trying to maintain a deficit). Then it turned into a combo of c/s and for the first time in my life, out-of-control binging. I had never felt what that was like before. But it is like a switch goes off in my mind- ‚ÄúI feel guilty for eating anyway, might as well eat more and get rid of it.‚Äù Now it‚Äôs been my fallback for everything- events, nights out with friends, even date nights. Who cares? The calories don‚Äôt count. Never mind it makes me feel ashamed and overwhelmed with guilt. I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight and people are telling me how ‚Äúamazing‚Äù I look - which only makes me want to keep the weight off. Now there are stretches of time when I purge daily, multiple times a day. I am worried about my health. But it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt stop, idk how to overcome the terror of gaining weight. Ironically I‚Äôm the most confident I‚Äôve ever felt in my body, I like the way I look. I finally feel comfortable wearing clothes that don‚Äôt hide my body. I don‚Äôt want to gain weight.

And TMI: I also had blood in my stool for the very first time and I‚Äôm freaked out. It didn‚Äôt happen again, so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on there or if it‚Äôs even related.

She wants me to go into an inpatient eating disorder program however I am terrified. I am in the overweight range.

does anyone else ever find that they sometimes have meals or days where they can basically eat a normal amount of Normal food and not feel the need too compensate after. 

like what. this morning i sobbed for an hour over a bowl of cereal. but then was able too last min go out for dinner with my family. i mean i still was checking cals etc and the thoughts were there, but I CHOSE too eat dinner AND desert. no one forced me. 
cant lie i still tried too pu*ge in the toilets but it diddnt work fml. now i just feel uncomfortably full. 

like why do i feel like im constantly fluttering between my healthy brain telling me too bloody give life a try and get out of this hole, and the other telling me too just go deeper into my ed than before- and Then i can recover and think about how too sort my life out and ill be ready and worthy too recover. 

neither sounds appealing so im just in this uncomfortable middle of not wanting too engage in either. ik ill think different by the morning & probs restrict but i'm so tired of this. 

at least i felt not so bloody depressed later in the day meet my family lol. i think feeling like that made it much easier too eat. i feel so invalid. just be consistent fml. anyone else ever feel similar."

I cannot just shove food in my mouth, down my gullet, and into my uncomfortably distended stomach just so I can push away the pain, push away the deep fears, anxieties, and voids that comprise my person. Who am I if you tear all my crutches down, you ask? I don't know. I don't know because I've never been free of anxiety, spiraling, urges, the constant grapple for control between my rational mind and the id inside me that is a basal emotional creature, seeking some sort of greater sustenance, attention, and care that I refuse to give it. Because I am unable to give myself any solace in this long and dreary night, because I am unable to pick the pieces of myself up from the ground and dust them tenderly. I am polished like a diamond if you don't look too closely, there are chips in me and cavities and gaping holes that I brush over with that velvety sheen and then I go out into the world and pretend that I know what I'm doing, that everything's okay, I pretend to be fine, a fully functioning member of society because humans are social animals, or something like that."

So I have been doing kinda well these past 4 days. I havent binged or purged (yay!). But I have been dealing with some eating, which I would describe as not truly a binge but still enough food to trigger some negative thoughts. This mostly happens when im stressed because of school. I think it could be described as boredom eating or prograstination eating. When this happens i dont eat true meals, but just random snacks and it adds up to a lot. It makes me feel out of control and sad eventhough it isnt a true binge.

I just wanted to hear if any of u guys have experienced this and have any advise?  

Also, I dont know if it is relevant but im in recovery rn and I am eating enough and variated everyday (even after a binge day)."

Not yet at least. My mom's proposed solution to any mental health issue is something along the lines of ""just stop."" When I have opened up to her on days when I am deeply depressed, she says to ""just snap out of it."" I semi-opened up to her about my fear surrounding food when I was heavily restricting, and she said ""you better stop thinking like that or you'll develop an eating disorder"" (HA!) Sure enough, in response to me breaking down crying about the b/p cycle I've fallen into, she said ""just stop doing it."" In fact, she is encouraging me to restrict again (""You've gotten so skinny! You look good! You don't want to ruin it! You need to cut back and eat only fruits and vegetables like you were doing before!"") 

In my mind, I was thinking that by telling her, it would force me to take some accountability for my actions, since I am no longer completely hiding this aspect of my disordered eating behaviors. But now, I'm thinking that I wish I would've chosen someone different to tell. And a large part of me wishes I'd never revealed this secret at all. 

Any thoughts or advice? Or has anyone gone through something similar?"

Club Bulimia

Hello and welcome to club bulimia

Forget the fad diets, the restricting, replacing your meals with gum

Everyone is welcome no matter your weight, age, religion, or race

You will find peace here

Binge on your favorite music

Sample our buffet

Heave plates and plates into your mouth

This is a party after all

Doesn't it feel good not to deny yourself?

After being caged by the bars of hunger

We gave you a jailbreak

Took away the laws you self imposed

We promise the only consequence is one quick trip to the bathroom

The flushing to wash away your sins

Being Baptized anew

If your hunger goes up the scale can still go down

This is how you weigh your self worth

Endless tables

Savor every last bite

Cookies softly yield before the edges break crisply

Taste of chocolate melting in the summer heat of your mouth

Pizza slices curl like flower petals in your palms
(The pepperoni might prick like thorns later
But thats just a small price to pay for thinness)

Soda fizzles in its container, but can't contain its excitement

The sweet nectar begging to be drunk

It washes into your body like a babbling brook

Ice cream offering its cold touch

The perspiration sliding off in droplets

To pool at the bottom before being lapped up

You can have it all

You don't have to restrict

No guilt, no self control

When the dancing gets old

And the performance is over

Don't forget the VIP suit

Reserved only for those most dedicated

Knock on the door 

The password is vomit

No it's not pretty

But neither is this addiction

Didn't you know what you were getting yourself into?

The urge to purge

The inability to think of anything else but your next meal

Up chucking into gas station bathrooms

Kneeling on a piss covered floor

Weeping into the crowned in brown porcelain

The viscous saliva that clings to your trembling fingers

The imprint of molars on your knuckles

As the indents slowly fade to ombre of burnt plum

This is the sacrifice to be beautiful

When you get home

Repeat this ritual

Offer your sacrifice

The sewage line will choke

regurgitate your regurgitations 

Spilling chunks onto the floor

Look in the mirror at yourself

Chipmunk cheeks

Bloated belly

Breakable bones

You wanted to be thin

Each single bite must be returned

You will not be ungrateful for how this saved you when you needed it the most

Fall into habits that you cannot stop

It will work if you just try harder

Ignore the acid reflux

You were never meant to be this full

This bursting

The tasty poison must be expelled

Even if that means your teeth break

Mouthful by mouthful

A gummy bear smile

Rose petals wilt in your hand

You drown in the brook of your saliva

The coldness of ice wrapped around your brain

Eyes stained apple red

Exploding under the strain of every day

You cannot stop this 

The expanding and contracting of your belly

As necessary as the expanding and contracting of lungs

Waiting for the day when your esophagus tears and you are a body in a bathroom

Blueberry bruised

Stuffed like a christmas turkey

Marinating in your own juices until someone finds you

You say you don't want to end up like that

That you want to fight this

But darling, if you want this party to end

Have fun cleaning up the mess"

idk if this is common or just another think my ed wants too make me miserable for. 

but id planned on fasting today too compensate for other things eaten day before, ended up eating unplanned food. nothing really too unhealthy & almost all still vegan which im glad im sticking too. but either way not the plan and now i feel like a failure and scared as shit im gonna gain again like yday. 

im pretty sure it was below maintenance but since i couldnt purge all of it the 'typical' way; ive started working out more again, sp for the last hour or so i was working out, and the second i start too actually enjoy it and not only do it too feel ok after what i ate and less anxious. like i was kinda doing it cause it felt fun- i start feeling guilty becaude this should be for punishment & compensation- not for me too enjoy. so that sucks. now theres literally nothing i can do. ive been feeling guilty for sitting recently and found myself trying too always be moving. 

i cant watch things for long unless their related too ed's, food, weight loss, or i feel there a good use of my time (like they're beneficial too my ed) so not even that i can escape too which used too be the biggest coping thing for me. love that.

now i just feel guilty, sick from the food, and theres nothing too enjoy- but im still telling myself theres nothing actually wrong. someone fix my brain pls.

Even worse than starvation. But here I am, doing it again. I also purge as in.. vomiting, but I don't do it that severely. Like, I only do it a bit to get some relief from the fullness if I've binged really bad.

And it's not even like I like it or I want to do it. But it feels like something I have to do for some reason. Does anyone else have problems with this? I feel like most people here have problems with like.. the vomiting type of purging.

So I feel kind of alone in this. Also, I do also have problems with starving myself. I starve myself like 4 days of the week, then the rest of the time I do this."

I didn't purge, not because I didn't desperately want to, but because I just physically couldn't get up and walk to the sink. I was just lying on the floor, sobbing intensely, because I wanted water so badly, but again, couldn't make it to the sink, and felt like my stomach would burst from even one sip of liquid. 

I think it's too early for me to say definitively whether I have bulimia, as this b/p cycle is so new. I definitely have disordered eating behaviors, but I'm actually coming off several months of heavy restriction that caused a massive weight loss. As fucked up as it sounds, now that this b/p cycle has begun, I don't understand how I ever had the ""willpower"" to restrict for as much and as long as I did. And while logically I know the thing I SHOULD be most concerned about is the toll the b/p is taking on my physical, mental, and emotional health, the thing I am actually most concerned about right now is gaining weight. 

I guess I'm just feeling extremely alone right now, and was hoping maybe hearing some words, any words really, from others who understand, might help."

They have told me when we started dating that they struggled with eating disorders but claimed that it was a long time (\~5-10 yrs) ago. A while after we started dating I asked them why they went to the bathroom after eating and they just said ""idk I just have to pee after I eat and want to wash my hands."" They were very upset with me when I asked if they still struggled with thoughts about eating.

This has continued for about a year and a half. Recently we went on vacation and it was literally every meal that they went to the bathroom after eating, and I am starting to get very concerned. I brought it up again, and they got mad at me and said they aren't bulimic. They said they had to pee, but I brought up that they had just gone before we ate and they changed their story to really just wanting to wash their hands. I said that if it's just washing their hands and it's not a big deal, could they just use hand sanitizer and help me feel less worried? At first they refused, but then they agreed. The whole conversation just felt they were choosing their words carefully.

I have only brought it up 3 times in our almost 2 years of being together, but it feels like every time I bring it up they get very upset with me and never budge from their original story. I am concerned that they are silently struggling with bulimia, but I just don't know what to do now. I'm also worried that I am misreading the situation and that they aren't bulimic, but I hate the thought of being too na√Øve and turning a blind eye.

I‚Äôve been dealing with my eating disorders (Anorexia and Bulimia, respectively), for the past four or so years. I developed those issues young, Anorexia at around fourteen and Bulimia at about fifteen, and I‚Äôve been through extensive treatment. 


(CW: from this point on, I talk about ED symptoms, hospitalizations, NG tubes, and some numbers relating to times of purging)


I have been hospitalized more times that I can count, sat on feeding tubes, starved myself, and was vomiting at a minimum fourteen times a week. I was rotting away, and it felt ,,, good, almost? 

When I was doing all these things, I didn‚Äôt feel as physically and mentally bad as I do now (to a degree). I was a lot more active during those years, and I could at least account my dizziness to those eating problems, now I‚Äôm overweight, always tired, dizzy half the time, and feeling super shitty about myself and my self image. I don‚Äôt feel adequate anymore. 

My treatment, hospitals and outpatients, they were fine, I guess, but never helped a ton, I just kinda forced myself and tried to recondition my brain. For about a year, I got little to no ED treatment, and that‚Äôs when I started to get ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù 

But now, I really feel crappy all the time, I don‚Äôt vomit as much as I‚Äôd like, eating more than i‚Äôd like, and losing less than i‚Äôd like. And I know, that a part of me wants to fully recover, but I‚Äôm stuck in quasi-recovery, and I‚Äôm eating better, but I feel almost as shitty. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be like this for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt know w where to start, getting help again. Should I talk to a therapist? Restart my meds (I just kinda stopped taking them)? I don‚Äôt know anymore. 

It seems obvious, yes I should get help again, but it doesn‚Äôt feel bad enough, and maybe a part of me wants to fall into old habit. What should I do?"

Anyone have any advice for avoiding B/P when in the environment it started?"

As I fall deeper into a pit of  ""will i ever heal?"", I have considered just being completely straight up with my loved ones about my EDs. I have grown more comfortable with the idea of sharing that i have anorexia, but telling anyone about the bulimia freaks the shit out of me. And its because I am afraid that once I tell my family about the bulimia, I will never be able to B/P again because I will finally be held accountable by others, and that honestly scares me. I fear what life is like with out even the option to B/P, though I know that a life focused around B/P, restriction, and body image is no life to live at all. I just want my life back."
