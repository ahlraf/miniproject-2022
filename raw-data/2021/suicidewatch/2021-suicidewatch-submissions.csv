I feel terrible because I am in much better situation that i was, and am luckier some people and still manage to be sad and wanna die. I feel guilty for it and I don't know how to cope with that feeling.

I was around 7. She definetly was over 18. For some reason its hard to remember...
You would think that if you're a loser most of your life it will change like in the movies.
But here i am,at 21 still being bullied and abused. My parents don't let me go to therapy.
I really want to go. They think im faking this. I am not... My mom says i act like the joker. She lies about illness all the time. But when i have a real diasiese (schitzophrenia) she bullies me. Tells me to kill myself,kicks me out of the house and when she isn't right in the fights she lies she kills herself. She goes up at the window and screams shell jump. Never does tho.

My life is a joke. I don't want to be here. I just wish someone would just come to me and say that theres still hope,or atleast tell me im a loser. All this questions and i still don't think i even exist. 

It doesn't even hurt anymore. I feel nothing,just a bit empty. Im used to this life. I tried so much to be a better person,i tried to fix this! But whenever my life seemed to to somewhere it would be actually worse than before.
So there is no point. God is just joking around with me.

Im aware of my diasise. I realise how fucked up i am. But nobody helps me,and i cannot help myself here. I just want someone to understand me,and to see that im not a monster! Not a weirdo... i wish...

I helped so many people in this life,but when i needed someone,they hurt me.

I think this year,in june,my birthday i might end all of this.

I just want to take my revenge.  I will make art that will hurt anyone that hears it. And then die. Thats about it. 

So yeah the reason i keep going is from anger. The humanity will feel my hate. They will feel just like me. I will never ever help anyone in my life. I will hurt anyone that will listen to my music. They will know then,not to be mean to a mentally ill. 

Happy new year. Thanks."

What wonderful memories. Not.

I’m still:

• Unemployed - My teens and early twenties were filled to the brim of unsuccessful job interviews. By the laws of averages, surely one had to be successful right? Not for me. I thought maybe the reason for my failures was my lack of confidence and nerves were all too evident, so I volunteered in most sectors ranging from retail to admin. Not even that benefitted me, besides the work experience.

• Living at home - I’m deathly afraid of change. I’m poor. Don’t really understand the concept of money. Reliant of family to mitigate my OCD. Hate the idea of dealing with people on a daily basis. 

• Depressed beyond belief - Wouldn’t you be if you were me?

• Agoraphobic - I don’t belong anywhere. Outside I feel like I’m trespassing and vulnerable.

• Friendless - I was always the person walking behind in my friendship groups when I was in school. Every break time I’d walk around the school to pass the time until lessons began. King loner shit. I did try to fit, though. I went to school everyday with a healthy amount of cash and I’d give it to so-called friends so they’d like me. Newsflash, they pretend to like me. As an adult in work environments, making friends was still impossible.

• Virgin - A virgin at 29. Enough said.

• Never been in a relationship - Couldn’t possibly burden another person into being with me. But I always thought if I fixed myself, then I could begin to think about that sort of things. Well, time waits for no one and now I’m worse off than I ever was.

• Ridden with social anxiety - I’ll give you a recent example. I’m so anxious around people that the nurse who came over to give me my booster jab yesterday had to ask me to point to which arm to stick the needle in because I seemed  to lose the ability to say one word ‘left’. 

• Sick of the hostility in this world - It breaks my heart seeing the hateful division caused by COVID. Being a pacifist in a world full of people hellbent on causing violence and abusing each other online is a disaster waiting to happen. 
I’ve realised this year that people are more than happy to call each other vicious names and there’s never any consequences. Worse still, these are the same people that are publicly mental health advocates. On Twitter, all too often you are likely to see somebody quote somebody’s tweet with some slander and initiate a pile on from that person’s followers. It’s just wrong.

When it ended my legs felt as if I was levitating off the ground because I felt light on my feet and just couldn’t wait to get out of there. I don’t meet many people. 


Only three years ago I graduated with a  Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism and Communication, receiving a 2.1. I said at the time that it’s unlikely I’ll ever get a chance to use it so I tried killing myself just before graduation. 

I wasn’t wrong. 

I used to have dreams and aspirations."

I swear on everything good this world I did EVERYTHING I could have done with the life I was given...

I've spent more time thinking about this then you can imagine and I swear on my life theres not one thing i could have done differently that could have saved my life... this is my fate and I swear if God exists I am cursed...

Who cares what my story is? The summary is this... I grew up in a broken family; my father was a selfish drunk and my mother struggled with OCD and wasnt perfect to say the least... I still remember them fighting (literally physically when I was maybe 5-6 years old; happened pretty often throughout my life) I heads my brother yell at my father saying ""you want your kid to grow up a heroin addict!?"". Maybe you could argue my fate was instilled that day but honestly... by the time I was 18-19 there was so much internal pain I cant even describe in words what it felt like... I dont want to glamorize addiction but when I started the way it removed my pain was indescribable and having ADHD could for one put my traumas aside and focus like I never naturally was able to my whole life....

You know what really set me off though.... Its that even after working so hard in life I cant tell you how many different great ideas I came up with to try to achieve financial freedom... My parents although
being middle class for some time unfortunately never cared about my future; especially my father who you would have thought would have atleast once raised concern about making a career or getting a higher education for myself.... Eventually I went to college studying CS and made it a little more than halfway through my degree but just got to be to much for me to handle...

What really grinds my gears though is all the time I invested trying to start my own business. I look back at all the research and planning I did and even now it seemed like a perfect plan... Every F+$&ing time I swear something happens that is out of my control that ruins everything. I swear right hand to God if he exists I SWEAR I'M CURSED.... Over and over no matter how hard I worked to have financial freedom, working my ass off at the gym just to be good enough for ONE PERSON in this life to give two fucks about me... I swear... My whole damn life was designed so everything I ever worked for just to have enough of a purpose in this life ALWAYS fails...

I always hated this system honestly... truth is no one daires say boo that its capitalism's fault but everyones shamlessly complains about why they should be rich... Truth be told all I ever really wanted was enough money to be financially free which as we all know are generation is fucked because everything is commodity and with inflation the cost of living has never been so outragously expensive... Its like one of my favorite qoutes go ""socialism for the rich; Capitalism for the poor...."".

Don't even get me started about what I think about social media and the waste of air of a people who created these dating apps based on pschological techniques to take advantage of peoples isolation...

It reminds me of that qoute in the bible when God punishes Adam and Eve in Gen 3 - ""I will make you and woman hate each other"". It feels like this applies more than just the incident of Adam and Eve and goes for anyone God doesnt like... I understand I'm intertwining both my financial and ""romantic"" failures but the point is I've been stripped of all purpose in life...

As much as I wish Id just OD already I have a feeling im gonna have to finish the job soon myself because theres no other way..."

rsxde0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rsxde0/strong_urges/,Strong urges.,4,7,1640967653.0,"Hey. It’s a little ironic that i’m here because everytime I have seen someone wanting to commit suicide, I’m always trying to convince them to think otherwise and strongly discourage them from doing it. 
Funny that I am now on the other side and feel a strong urge to want to do it, just don’t necessarily know how, I’m between much too afraid and developing plans in my head. 

I guess it would make sense to introduce myself so here goes:

I’m 23, turning 24 soon in February, and I work in a hospital as a nursing assistant in the ICU. I have witnessed everything the pandemic has done from destroying families, killing people and unethical like healthcare. I was going to nursing school but got kicked out for failing grades. 

I am in $10k credit card/student loan debt, which is why I have been working 50-60 hours a week since October to pay off as much as I can before interest kills me.

I also have gone to therapy the last 5 years and cycled through different antidepressants/therapists before finding out that these interventions just weren’t working for me and gave up on it altogether. Issues in therapy include, substance use addiction, extreme low self worth, crippling social anxiety, low confidence, problems with finding a partner (again, due to my extreme anxiety, it’s hard because everytime I had been in a relationship, I always felt like I was walking on eggshells), have gotten cheated on multiple times, lost a unborn child in miscarriage from my ex girlfriend, and have eating disorders that pop up when I am dissatisfied with the way that my body looks. I also misinterpret genuine kindness from women as them being attracted to me. #FriendZoned
I get attached way too easily as well.

I am very emotional all the time but can switch this off when I need to (i.e work or in public) The majority of the time I am on a head trip with my own thoughts 24/7 & it’s horrible. I am high functioning and would appear like your ordinary guy out on the street. I eat as healthy as I can, I weight lift 3-4x a week and sleep 8 hours.

Only have one friend, i still live with my parents (was emotionally neglected as a child however). 

I struggle with school as well, leading me to believe that I cannot do anything with my future at times. I don’t have a learning disability as far as I know. I even tried starting my own marketing agency and that failed miserably. 

I have attempted the last 10 years (since i was 13) to fix myself every single day and the more I tried to fix things, it goes nowhere or worse. I’ve felt this shitty since I was 4 years old. I’m tired. I’m exhausted of doing this every day with no end in fucking sight. I frequently fantasize about getting run over by a car, someone assaulting me and killing me, not waking up, or dying from COVID. 

My only 2 mental strengths is a God like work ethic and wanting to do good in the world. This is the only thing that keeps me going. But my motivation for this is starting to disappear and I’m just trying desperately to survive. I want to give up. 

I just want someone to listen."

I would change everything if I could.

I didn't choose to be born here, under these circumstances. Despite my best efforts to turn things around, I failed. A decade of my life wasted. I still ended up lonely and miserable. Perhaps I am too broken to be normal.

The life I lived is not worth living for. The pain is unbearable now, I cannot prolong my misery. I cannot live a life where I will never experience love.

I promised myself I won't live to see the light of 2022 and I intend to honor my wishes. My time's up."

I spend my teen years taking care of my family and in an abusive relationship. I get out and assume responsibility of my partner and move out and then my mom dies. We figure things, get a place and finally are on our feet, still pay check to paycheck but not hungry.  and then we get Covid, take a huge fall and get up again. Then my bpd starts ruining my life again and I  stop working regularly and my partner assumes responsibility of our bills. This was in September. It’s now December and they’ve lost their will to do anything and use any excuse to not work. I am trying to go back but my job has laid me off. Now after a year of some success we will be evicted from our apartment come the new year, our fridge is empty, our apartment is cold, we have no family that gives a single fuck about us. I want to just overdose like before but without waking up. I want them to finally care about us. I want them to care about my partner. I know everyone pities those who lose their loved ones. I want to make that sacrifice for them and finally be at peace. Then they can get the help they deserve and I can show them what truly loving someone and sacrifice.

I think and I realize that I've done nothing of note and it's the same day every day for me now. It's the New Years, it's something special and I didn't even notice nor did I care in any way.  I can't but think about how sad that is and how sad excuse of a person I am. I wonder why I'm even going on. There are two modes in my life: school and no school. School, I'm miserable. I hate it. It's two days before school starts again and I've never dreaded anything that I ever have in my life. No school, better but empty. I just go through life like a robot. I neither enjoy nor don't enjoy doing anything.

Life for me essentially alternating between miserable and empty. I don't know why I'm doing this. I hate it and I hate myself. There's so much I could be doing now but I just can't bring myself to do it. Why should I? It's probably just like everything else in my life: miserable, empty, or both!

I feel horrible about it, I horrible about myself and I feel horrible about being such a heavy burden on my parents. I hate that I'm useless but I hate more that I feel like I can't do anything about it and that I'm just destined to be sad and miserable and pathetic.

Like, what's the point of life? Why do I keep going through it? It doesn't do anything for me and I certainly don't do anything for the people around me. So why shouldn't I just remove myself from it?"

Everytime I try to open up about how I feel I immediately get the “gO tO tHe HoSpItAl” from everyone. No one will sit down and process how I’m feeling, not even the crisis hotline or my therapist. So what are my fucking options?

It’s like they say “go to the hospital” because no one wants to fucking deal with me. Well, I’m sorry for existing and having problems. I didn’t ask for this. This shit never gets better, I’ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 8 and it hasn’t gotten better as I’m in my 20s. Fuck.

EDIT: 1) thanks for the award thing, I’m not that Reddit savvy. 2) If you don’t know what BPD is, please don’t say shit like “just find a new therapist”. If you knew anything about BPD, it’s incredibly painful and difficult to treat, and it requires a skillful and trained therapist who is willing to treat BPD patients. 

It’s very hard to find someone like that that also accepts my insurance, AND is available for weekly sessions. I’ve been turned away from several mental health clinics and therapists because I simply have a BPD dx. It’s not that easy. If I could just “find a new therapist”, I wouldn’t be in the situation I’m in. Thanks.  Rant over.

Edit 2: I’m fortunate enough to have healthcare in the states. If I needed to go to the hospital, I could go. I just don’t think it’s appropriate. I’m tired of being told to “just go to the hospital” when all I need is someone who will validate how I’m feeling and maybe process some of it."

But fuck man, all NYE is to me at this point is a reminder that the years are ticking by and everything keeps getting fucking worse. Not even talking about the virus bullshit, my shit was still well and truely fucked back when Corona was just a beer. Guess it hasn’t fucking helped anything either though.

Didn’t think I’d feel more shitty than this time last year. Spent NYE last year trying to drink myself into an early grave and doing rails of coke someone I’d never met gave me in a bathroom. First memories of 2021 were spent being so fucking hungover I couldn’t stand up without feel like I was gonna pass out. But somehow, here is it, stone cold sober and it’s way worse. 

Every single year I feel like it’s taken every last thing I had, and every year the next year reminds me of what little I had left by taking that too. But thinking about what I lost in 2021 isn’t just depressing cause I lost it, it’s mostly depressing to think that those things were really all I had going for me. Depressing to think I was surviving on such fucking table scraps and even those were taken. 

Started the year with I job I fucking hated, but one that let me afford my shitty, cockroach ridden shoebox of an apartment so that I could live alone. It was a fucking gross apartment, but at least I was free in it. If I was still there I’d be blasting music over speakers rather than having to use headphone like I do right now. But I got way too fucking depressed to be able to work and had to move back in with my toxic fucking mother, just like always fucking happens when I claw my way outta here.

Moving back in with her cost me every fucking freedom I had. We got another wave of covid here almost immediately and since my mums such a paranoid control freak, she won’t let me leave the house (says she’ll kick me out if I ignore her and leave anyway), can’t go to the fucking gym anymore, can’t ever be alone cause her and her fucking husband are always here, she even opens my fucking mail “in case the envelope has covid”. It’s fucking ridiculous, I’m fucking 22 and I feel like a fucking teenager again.

Also had the last smouldering embers of my one and only friendship I’ve had this lifetime finally get snuffed. It was realistically treading water when the year started, but I guess I didn’t realise how much I still valued the once per months she’d text me outta the blue and the 4-5 consecutive replies I could get outta her before she was gone again. Been 7 months now. Knew it was officially dead when I didn’t get a “merry Christmas” text. She always used to send one. 

A day later the last of the two goldfish she bought me died. Didn’t think that’s bother me, I didn’t even fucking want them, specifically told her not to get them at the time. But again, it was just one more thing I had but don’t anymore. Probably all for the best though. Didn’t want the goldfish, knew when she bought they’d probably wind up being a reminder of a friend I’d lost. 

Fuck her though, she clearly wasn’t interested in being friends for months, glad she finally grew up and stopped checking in each month. Probably only did it to make sure I wasn’t dead, guess all it takes in one little suicide attempt and all of a sudden people feel the need to fucking put you on life alert at all times like you can’t be trusted to take care of yourself. Can’t wrap my head around why she’d fucking bother anymore though, she pretty clearly didn’t fucking care to spend any time or even really talk with me while I was alive last year, so why the fuck does it matter to her if I was dead? 

So yeah, 2021 took my last few freedoms and autonomy, the last thing I had that even sorta resembled a friendship, my pets that I low key didn’t even want. Can’t wait to fucking see what 2022 reminds me I have only to fucking rip out from under me. Maybe it’ll finally be the year I get it all over with and kill myself. Not like I have anything to stick around for. Don’t fucking enjoy anything anymore at all. And my life is just gonna be a constant loop of moving out, getting my freedom for a while until my mental health cripples me, stops me from being able to work, and forces me back to my mum’s. Got no future anyway."

I have been thinking about it every day, every hour since August 17th. It is my fault. There is no worse and more loser and unreliable person in this world than I am. I have excommunicated the harasser from all my social circles and told few other women what he did, but it is neither enough nor in time. I lost her trust and her feelings for me and now will have to live in a nightmare world which I myself had put myself in. I wonder if we were never meant to be or we were but I'd just ruined it. She was always kind to me and even confessed feelings for me at some point. It hurts even more. No other woman can replace her. And I tried to connect with many. None of them are even close to making me feel what I'd felt.

To be honest I always hated and was uncomfortable living. There is a lot of suffering and very little pleasure in it. I have empathy and emotional connection issues. Guess this incident was just the last straw. There is very little good about me.

I am too cowardly to do anything to myself anyway. But I will go into 2022 with suicide ideation on my mind. Everything feels so pointless."

I have always had anxiety during my life , and mild health anxiety...but for three months it's really severe. And the worst thing is that the more tests I do, the more inconclusive the information is. I had an MRI and it showed two lesions (one of which could be from MS). Some doctors dismissed it, and some were concerned. The worst thing is that my numbness and tingling in left arm, leg and face corresponds to that lesion.  I was in a hospital and had a lumbar puncture. It was a terryfing experience being locked in a small room for seven days without being able to get out because of covid regulations(I have claustrophobia). Initial tests came out OK, but I'm going to get the rest of the results in several days and I'm terrified. If it says it's MS I'm going to kill myself. I know that you can live a normal life with it and many people are fighting this disease but I don't have the capacity to do this.

I want to lock myself in the dark and just wither away but even my memories haunt me. 

Nothing makes me want to live anymore. I just want to give up. What is left for me? I’m worthless. I have no skills, no money, no beauty, nothing to offer the world. Maybe fourth times the charm and I’ll actually go through with it this time. All I can think is that if I die, I’ll be able to go back and live in my happy memories as my own form of heaven.

I still had to hold back the things that wouldn’t be considered confidential cause I’m a minor (14F). And everyone always says to just get help, but some people don’t have that option available to them. For me I can’t because of the fallout from my parents, giving them one more thing to use against me/hurt me with. I also know that I can’t wait this out till I’m older. The person that I talked to about some of my struggles can’t truly help me. They can support me, but they can’t give me treatment for my issues. Along with that holding back information from them, kind of stops them from understanding what’s wrong. I don’t know anymore.

I did not pay for his BS course, but wasted an hour and a half watching his useless webinar.

I thought I might finally be able to claim my own life, but I'm still stuck, no closer to having my own life, and I just don't want to go through anymore.

I just turned 26, caught the fucking virus RIGHT before losing my parents health insurance, and for all I know my joke of an employer might try and deny me the health insurance I signed up for because I got sick and infected RIGHT before the end of the year, I was afraid I'd get this stupid virus right before the end of the year when I lose my guaranteed and free health insurance (I also take multiple meds on a daily basis for the past 10 years, I can't function without them, one is an SSRI and I'd rather die than suffer the withdrawal from that).

I don't want to spend more years of my life trying to start a successful business, I don't want to go to school for 4+ years to MAYBE be able to get a decent job afterwards (when I'll be in my fucking 30s), and I don't want to go through another year of being abused by customers, managers, being seen as less than human doing meaningless labor and barely paid $350 a week for it, what a fucking joke.

I hate this fucking society, I hate American capitalism, I hate this fucking world. 

I can't go through another year bagging groceries and pushing carts, I don't want to be in ANY retail environment AT ALL, none of them treat or pay their employees right, they all suck. I can't go through mood swings from having to take so many goddamn pills all the time, and being dismissed as ""imagining it"" or ""making it up"" or ""exaggerating"" (DOCTORS DO THIS TOO).

I can't go through another year of being the awkward older guy working around a bunch of teenagers, can't drive a fucking car because of PTSD and constant road rage, inability to have a girlfriend or lose virginity, and just inability to get a decent job/source of income (fuck Mike Vestil and his BS passive income SCAM) so I can start and live my own fucking life.

Society is BROKEN, it is RIGGED, everyone is overruled and exploited by the 1% ELITIST BASTARDS. 

My parents continue to tell me I'm wrong or being ridiculous until realizing how ignorant they were and that I'm not as stupid as they act like I am, finally took me being sick seriously when I got an actual positive COVID test, and now my employer is making it hard to get the pay they're supposed to give infected employees. I don't even know if they're going to let me have my health insurance now, I can't just stop taking Sertraline, Oxcarbazepine (been on them for 10 YEARS) and Bupropion SR (which has gotten my ubncontrollable rage outbursts under control, PREVENTING ME FROM KILLING SOMEONE IT WAS GETTING THAT BAD BEFORE I TOOK THAT).

I just get older and older, my youth was a waste, it was meaningless, and I didn't really get to enjoy it at all.

I'm sick of stupid ignorant idiots telling me to just ""man up"" or ""grow the fuck up"" or any of that ""tough love"" BS, it does nothing but make me want to hurt them, or myself more.

I just get older and older, and nothing really changes, I hate the fucking real world, I do not belong in modern society,  and it just gets harder and harder to change anything.

If I try to go back to school, I have to work less, but I have to work more to keep that health insurance, and I have to pay more for Uber to get there, but I'll make less from working less, and if I just do it at home, that's just continuing my life of isolation and it is mentally terrifying (severely worse from fever dreams like being sick right now).

I can't even enjoy the little things anymore, like watching YouTube, playing games, watching shows, because reality is getting closer, time isn't slowing down at all, I'm not getting any younger.

I just keep getting older and still get no closer to being able to start live, live on my own, have my own place, have a girlfriend, have sex, I couldn't even travel the goddamn world without ""getting rich quick"" (those other things don't require that, but require being able to live on my own, and even making a LIVING INCOME can't be gotten quick).

Even SLOW AND STEADY success, isn't guaranteed, but that's still depressing because I didn't get to enjoy any of my youth, not even my goddamn 20s, which are almost over, and most certainly will be by the time I could realistically achieve  any type of success, financial or otherwise. 

Money does matter, it's how we're literally able to live, and there's an excess of jobs which pay FAR BELOW even a BASIC living wage, and inflation is only getting worse.

So many people ARE working from home, supposedly for more than these crap jobs, but I still don't know what they're doing or how to get into it.

It seems there really is no genuine legitimate way to get rich quick, and the quickest thing you can achieve is an income that can't even cover rent and bills, it's all a goddamn joke.

I'm not 18, or 21, I'm 26 now, I missed out on everything, I'm expected to be past it all, but I never lived any of it, and I don't even know how to get into life FROM THIS POINT.

I just don't get it."

I just noticed this randomly this afternoon when I touched my arm. 

I was suicidal a few months ago but didn't really know how to proceed with this (aside from being a coward and scared to push through with it). I've been doing research on the different methods. It's almost become a habit before sleeping to look into different ways. I am leaning towards slashing my wrists. My veins are quite visible when you look at my hands/arms but I feel like it's just because I am relatively light skinned and there's still a chance that I could still miss the vein when I cut. I also read that when medical professionals need to draw blood, sometimes they have to hold down the vein to make sure it doesn't shift. But I've been losing weight these past few months and now I can feel the veins are really visible so I think it makes it easier. 

I don't think I'm going to do it now but it makes me more confident of the method as a last resort. 

I don't know why I'm posting it here. I guess the idea was just so vivid and clear in my head earlier that I needed to let it out into the void."

So I know this person on Twitter, I've been following them for a while and appreciate their content, and only DMed once. He is in the femboy community which is heavily involved with how cute or sexy someone looks and acts. And I just now noticed his behavior getting worse and worse over the months, from ""jokingly"" saying he wants to be impaled, to an actual picture of him cutting into his skin ""KMS"" and something else I couldnt make out. Since the community often revolves around looks, people often get insecure about their body, and it definitely shows, and rightfully so, he in my honest opinion doesn't look that good or attractive, however he is extremely talented and knowledgeable on engineering topics. And I'm very worried he doesn't have the proper help he needs. People in the comments were saying stuff like ""oh dw you're attractive"" and stuff, but the thing is, he isn't, and he knows he isn't, and he even called out people who said he was. My original plan was to dm him telling him that yes, he unfortunately was unattractive, but that it doesn't have to matter, and that he is incredibly talented at engineering, and many people would be envious of how much he knows. I want to be honest with him and not cover up the deep wound with a bandage like everyone else giving him complements. I really want to help him, however maybe actually telling him the truth may do more harm. And also who am I, someone who has only talked to him superficially once, to now all of a sudden try to help him. I really hope some of you respond, I need help in this situation."

I'm the kind of person who always reaches out to others first. 

I feel like I don't really matter to anyone anymore. I'm sad of working all day, literally spending no time with others, and when I try to reach out others don't really care. just getting by day by day. I just exist at this point for nothing at all, not even myself. 

people like me because they think I'm pretty, or because they like my artwork, or because I am good at my job. People just like me because they can get something from me. If you take those things away, really no one genuinely cares. 

I've been medicated and it made me feel insane, I have BPD and was placed on antidepressants and anxiety meds both of which helped the thoughts in the past but made me feel so manic that my words were tripping over myself.

I realize too that the emptiness doesn't go. I don't want to suffer anymore.

Maybe I'll be medicated, but that emptiness is always there no matter how many things I try doing to cover it up. No one will help me and I can't help myself. I've called the hotline before and they told me it wasn't urgent so...

I feel so sad, on the verge of breaking down, and in front of people I feel done and numb. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve tried talking to my parents about how I feel but my mom just get yells at me to stop crying. She then tells my entire family what has happened. My dad thinks I’m lazy too, but he tries to find ways for me not to fall behind. 

My mom and 2 older sisters have been diagnosed with depression, and it makes me feel like maybe I am overreacting and it makes me feel like ‘why can they get help and I can’t?’ My sister once asked my dad to describe our personalities and said that I was emotionally stable, the easier one.

My sister has also told my parents “I hate myself” “I wish I wasn’t born” “You all would be better off without me” She just gets told to stop thinking like that. It makes me scared about telling them how I feel. They already think I’m lazy, and if they think I’m lying too or overreacting, I’m too afraid of what they would do. Also nothing is private, ANYTHING that happens all my aunts, uncles, grandparents get told. 

My stepparents also aren’t an option to say anything to. My stepfather always points out every mistake I make. My stepmom is sweet, but she also talks about my sisters behind their backs and probably does it about me too. 

I’ve tried talking to crisis lines because during the day I think about how bad I wish a car would hit and kill me. I pray at night that I’ll just die in my sleep. How easy it would be to take all the pills from the medicine cabinet or take one of the kitchen knives and lock the bathroom door and no one would find out until morning. The crisis line told me I could talk to a school counselor but they would tell my parents and I don’t think I can risk it.

I just feel so sad all the time and there’s no reason for me to feel this way. I keep thinking there must be something wrong with me. I feel so disgusted and angry with myself about how unproductive I am. I feel happy once in a while but that’s it.

I’m thinking about waiting until I’m an adult to go and find help, but sometimes I have thoughts in my mind like that I can just stop trying at school because it’s not like I’ll live long enough to graduate.

I don’t know, is what I’m feeling normal and I am just overreacting? Is there any way I can get help to stop feeling like this?"

I started feeling depressed about when my dad left when I was 13 and we were poor, mom struggling, no electricity etc. 

It hit a breaking point 6 years ago when I found out the woman I was with slept with someone else. It destroyed me. I attempted suicide at the time but was unsuccessful. 

Fast forward to today, I have a son who is being kept from me because of a crazy ex (genuinely I just want 50/50 but as the male i don’t get a say, thanks canada!

I have a girl I’ve been seeing for about four months. I’ve known her for much longer but as soon as we started spending time together it was just “boom”. If you know you know. 
There’s been issues, sure, but nothing has come close to how she makes me feel. She recently lost 7000$ in cash from her bedroom closet (she’s a server, lots of cash from tips saved up over time). She has come to the conclusion that either myself or her roommate has stolen it. ( I did not) she says she doesn’t think it’s me but at the same time can’t be sure. I’ve fucked up a lot in my life, a lot of bad decisions. But to be accused of stealing this much money from someone you’re falling in love with at the height of losing everything that matters in my life due to Covid/custody problems. I’m done I think. 

Do you think she’s crazy for not believing me? While st the same time believing me? 
Please any insight before everything takes a hold of me and I’m gone. Thank you"

My whole life I’ve always struggle with depression ,abandonment issues, and possibly other kind of mental health problems. My parents never really believe in mental illness so every time I try to seek mental help they just kinda brush it off like it’s nothing serious. Well now years later of neglecting my mental health problems and never have my feelings validated it’s getting to me. I met my boyfriend 23 M when I was a sophomore in high school. Since I never really get any attention at home I thought being with someone older will fix my problems. He was very manipulative and because of that I lost connections with all my friends. I also stop hanging out with my family as much as I did before. Ever since I got with him I kinda lost all interest in everything I wanted to do like going to colleges. I just kinda lost all my ambitions because I was too focus on the relationship. I never really understood why I stayed in the relationship for so long. I was never happy in the relationship. It’s like I’ve lost my whole life into this relationship. I’m not the same person I once was before the relationship. I feel so hopeless and regretting everything. Its like I really fuck my life up and there’s no way of fixing it. Now 4 years later I’m pregnant with his baby. I’m currently 36 weeks pregnant. I just don’t wanna live with regrets my whole life and being with someone who don’t make me happy anymore. I don’t have any purpose to live for. I don’t want this life I got myself in. Everyday I pray and pray that something would happen to me and just end my suffering. I never wanted my life to turn out like this and it’s all my fault for allowing it to turn into a shit hole. Suicide seem to be the only way out of it for me. I’m planning on doing it after I have this baby. I feel so bad for bringing him into this world just to see his mom commit suicide but I just can’t keep going on anymore. I know he will do fine with his dad. Plus it makes me feel a little better doing it since there will be a life relaxing my death anyways."

when I was struggling with suicidal thoughts, every day was a battle, and every day was grey except for those explosions of rage and/or despair that I could barely keep a lid on. i desperately wanted to cut--because physical pain is much better than mental distress, ofc....but I couldn't. 

then came *the* pivotal moment. and I still couldn't. 

to this day, it is the deepest embarrassment of mine, positively humiliating. death, which I was very familiar with and became deeply comfortable with, what I wanted the most at that time...i couldn't do it. could take that step. the people that know me would generally say I'm pragmatic and even slightly intimidating--what has denied me without seeing hell for it? what have I been denied of without reaching my hand out and attempting to snatch it away?

death, apparently. 

it is my greatest shame that my easy confidence dissipated like smoke in the face of my depression. like the rest of me. it had felt like a piece of me, of my soul, had dried up and fallen off, that I was corrupt, rotten, a disgusting thing beneath the surface. if I still had my surety then, I would not have hesitated.

it was due to the immeasurable cowardice that I am here today. in my eleventh hour, I couldn't cut to even spare myself of the screaming between my ears. it is because of this that when other people come out about their own struggles with depression and/or suicidal thoughts I can do nothing to comfort them. we all know that there is nothing that can be said that wont feel like a saying picked up from a hallmark card, cold and impersonal no matter who delivers it. 

and I cant help but think that if they're even half of what I am now, without depression, that they would do what I couldn't, and that there is nothing I could say to discourage them. its a special kind of helplessness, a strange affliction pulling me in two different directions. does anyone else deal with this?

i say I'm no longer depressed (for the most part), but there are nights like this where the ghost of it comes back like sheer fluttering curtains beneath the moon and breeze, obscuring my sights. even now, its a battle. it never ends. and if I had cut then, would I still be here to be burdened with the fight?"

I did not pay for his BS course, but wasted an hour and a half watching his useless webinar.

I thought I might finally be able to claim my own life, but I'm still stuck, no closer to having my own life, and I just don't want to go through anymore.

I just turned 26, caught the fucking virus RIGHT before losing my parents health insurance, and for all I know my joke of an employer might try and deny me the health insurance I signed up for because I got sick and infected RIGHT before the end of the year, I was afraid I'd get this stupid virus right before the end of the year when I lose my guaranteed and free health insurance (I also take multiple meds on a daily basis for the past 10 years, I can't function without them, one is an SSRI and I'd rather die than suffer the withdrawal from that).

I don't want to spend more years of my life trying to start a successful business, I don't want to go to school for 4+ years to MAYBE be able to get a decent job afterwards (when I'll be in my fucking 30s), and I don't want to go through another year of being abused by customers, managers, being seen as less than human doing meaningless labor and barely paid $350 a week for it, what a fucking joke.

I hate this fucking society, I hate American capitalism, I hate this fucking world. 

I can't go through another year bagging groceries and pushing carts, I don't want to be in ANY retail environment AT ALL, none of them treat or pay their employees right, they all suck. I can't go through mood swings from having to take so many goddamn pills all the time, and being dismissed as ""imagining it"" or ""making it up"" or ""exaggerating"" (DOCTORS DO THIS TOO).

I can't go through another year of being the awkward older guy working around a bunch of teenagers, can't drive a fucking car because of PTSD and constant road rage, inability to have a girlfriend or lose virginity, and just inability to get a decent job/source of income (fuck Mike Vestil and his BS passive income SCAM) so I can start and live my own fucking life.

Society is BROKEN, it is RIGGED, everyone is overruled and exploited by the 1% ELITIST BASTARDS. 

My parents continue to tell me I'm wrong or being ridiculous until realizing how ignorant they were and that I'm not as stupid as they act like I am, finally took me being sick seriously when I got an actual positive COVID test, and now my employer is making it hard to get the pay they're supposed to give infected employees. I don't even know if they're going to let me have my health insurance now, I can't just stop taking Sertraline, Oxcarbazepine (been on them for 10 YEARS) and Bupropion SR (which has gotten my ubncontrollable rage outbursts under control, PREVENTING ME FROM KILLING SOMEONE IT WAS GETTING THAT BAD BEFORE I TOOK THAT).

I just get older and older, my youth was a waste, it was meaningless, and I didn't really get to enjoy it at all.

I'm sick of stupid ignorant idiots telling me to just ""man up"" or ""grow the fuck up"" or any of that ""tough love"" BS, it does nothing but make me want to hurt them, or myself more.

I just get older and older, and nothing really changes, I hate the fucking real world, I do not belong in modern society,  and it just gets harder and harder to change anything.

If I try to go back to school, I have to work less, but I have to work more to keep that health insurance, and I have to pay more for Uber to get there, but I'll make less from working less, and if I just do it at home, that's just continuing my life of isolation and it is mentally terrifying (severely worse from fever dreams like being sick right now).

I can't even enjoy the little things anymore, like watching YouTube, playing games, watching shows, because reality is getting closer, time isn't slowing down at all, I'm not getting any younger.

I just keep getting older and still get no closer to being able to start live, live on my own, have my own place, have a girlfriend, have sex, I couldn't even travel the goddamn world without ""getting rich quick"" (those other things don't require that, but require being able to live on my own, and even making a LIVING INCOME can't be gotten quick).

Even SLOW AND STEADY success, isn't guaranteed, but that's still depressing because I didn't get to enjoy any of my youth, not even my goddamn 20s, which are almost over, and most certainly will be by the time I could realistically achieve  any type of success, financial or otherwise. 

Money does matter, it's how we're literally able to live, and there's an excess of jobs which pay FAR BELOW even a BASIC living wage, and inflation is only getting worse.

So many people ARE working from home, supposedly for more than these crap jobs, but I still don't know what they're doing or how to get into it.

It seems there really is no genuine legitimate way to get rich quick, and the quickest thing you can achieve is an income that can't even cover rent and bills, it's all a goddamn joke.

I'm not 18, or 21, I'm 26 now, I missed out on everything, I'm expected to be past it all, but I never lived any of it, and I don't even know how to get into life FROM THIS POINT.

I just don't get it."

If I stay alive, what do I have? If I finish college, I'll be thrust out onto a dying planet with nothing but a BFA and a mountain of debt. If I'm lucky I can get myself a tiny apartment to sit around and watch myself grow old and fall apart in.

The only people who fall in love with me are totally insane and usually narcissists. People like how I look and aren't interested in getting to know who I really am. All I want is someone who's kind and trusts me and is willing to communicate but all I get are these petty passive aggressive people who only want a partner so they can post us on their instagram.

At any moment I could suffer some freak accident that leaves me permanently disabled. This has already happened to a family member of mine. It's made me realize that for some people, life is torture up until you die. I've seen my parents, these people who were once young and full of hope, fall apart completely. My mom teeters on poverty, hobbling around in between her surgeries taking care of my grandma and walking dogs for minimum wage. There's no way up. It doesn't get better. It only ever gets worse. She did nothing wrong but she is still going to die tired and bitter and unaccomplished.

There is nothing looking out for us. God won't protect me. Karma won't make things right. A shooting star, a little chunk of rock burning up in the atmosphere, can't hear me beg for life to get better. There is no cosmic rule that suffering is wrong and should be prevented. Humans made that up, but the universe doesn't care.

This year I couldn't afford Christmas presents for my family. Next year I'll get everyone really, really good birthday gifts. I'll send my roommate enough money to cover my part of rent until the lease is up. I'll fly to my home state so my family doesn't have to pay so much to transport my body. I'll find a quiet place. I'll set my phone up to call 911 at a time when I'm sure it'll be over. I'll tie a trash bag over my head and fill it with keyboard cleaner like my best friend did in high school and I'll die.

But my job is so exhausting and I'm so depressed I spend all my free time laying around doing nothing. 

The clock is ticking and I haven't made anything yet. I don't even know if I want to keep making anything if the world is just going to stay in this fucking pandemic for my entire life. 

Any friends I used to confide in are too busy to talk to me anymore. Any friends I normally don't confide in don't seem to know how to handle it when I'm honest about how depressed I am. Every therapist in a 100 mile radius isn't taking new patients.

This really feels like it's just it for me. I'm unfullfilled, miserable about any prospect of the future, I find joy in absolutely nothing that used to bring me joy, and even the loved ones around me who care don't make me feel a thing.

At least then I wouldn’t feel so lonely and be with others who’ve done the same.

My family is dead, my only remaining family is my emotionally dependent mother who is only interested after my brother (her clear favorite) died, and my wife is leaving me. I’m just too tired to keep going.

I’ve overcome domestic abuse as a child and an adult, been sexually assaulted multiple times, and had to car for myself and others since I was a kid. I was always the rock for everyone else and now…. Idk. I just don’t see the point in fighting it anymore. 

This has been an urge I’ve been fighting since I was a teenager (I’m 31 now) and the weight of everything is too much. I can keep carrying it but why? For what reason? I’m sick of feeling inadequate, sick of putting so much into life only to have it thrown back in my face or to be expected to just soldier on through all the funerals, all the putting pieces back together over and over. I’ve felt empty for a long time now and I only kept working on myself and made an effort because I didn’t want to hurt my wife. But now she’s going to go do her own thing and I think she’d survive without me just fine. She has a support system and a bright future. 

I don’t want to face what’s next. The world is falling apart, my family is gone, my life I built disintegrated beneath my feet. I wrote two copies of the note and put them in ziplock bags so they’ll stay intact. I’m keeping one in my pocket so it can be recovered with me and the other I’ll duct tape at my jump site/ the bridge down the street from my house. I updated and notarized my will and I’ve seen my remaining people for Christmas one last time. 

I’m scared, but I’m at peace. I am ready to see what’s next, even if it’s just blackness."

To bottle up my emotions

Will do what I’m too weak to do

I drown the bad thoughts 
In tsunamis of drugs and liquor

Will subside long enough

So alot has happened in my life. From bullying to isolation to narcissistic abuse from my parents to neglect to alcohol addiction to abuse in general to abandonment to multiple deaths of loved ones and friends to soon losing my aunt due to her cancer to losing my mom cuz I was too much to being in an unhealthy relationship to getting cancer to not having a real father in my life to getting other medical conditions to losing my teeth due to treatments to having mental illnesses (OCD, CPTSD, Insomnia, GAD, and MDD) to having autism and CAPD my whole life to medical trauma to seeing traumatic shit go down growing up. 
Making a bunch of sins  and mistakes down the road. 

Yeah life's been a rollercoaster. I have tried to end it multiple times but haven't succeeded all with alcohol. Unfortunately I am still here and live in physical pain and mental pain each day. And the problem with alcohol is when people find out at least when my family found out they shamed me and guilt me for being mentally ill and having an alcohol problem (they blamed it all on the alcohol when they missed the whole point that I used it to go to sleep and never wake up again). On top of that all my trauma haunts me and I been getting this vivid warning dreams lately just like I used to get when I was younger. They each have a fear and warning in it. I truly believe some dreams can warn you or give u signs about your real time life. 

I can lucid dreams at times and can sometimes choose what I want to dream about but not always. I wish I could sleep forever and not worry about real time life. Like I wish I could be in my dreams all the time, not the bad ones tho, the good ones, yes. I feel safe in them. I just wish I could disappear too without anyone noticing. I been thinking about my passing for quite sometime now. I don't want anyone to find me so I can save someone from the trauma and pain I may cause in the process. I also don't want it to be a gruesome going. I want it to be fast and quiet. 
 
I'm tired of fighting when everyone in my life has shown me I don't matter in life and on top of it I'm just exhausted with my cancer and all the effects it has caused and continues to cause. I wish it killed me already. And before anyone says oh but your so strong. I am tired of being tough and strong. I have been in fight and flight mode my whole life and I'm ready to shut down. I also didn't have a choice. 
And I'm getting so sick and tired of hearing oh stay positive, it will be okay! How do you know that? And what if I don't want to be positive all the time? Does that make me a bad person? If anything it's cause I'm exhausted and fighting wars constantly. And anyone who doesn't get that, well I'm glad u don't have to go through the shit I have been through and continue to go through. I'm glad that person doesn't have trauma cuz it sucks and my mind is constantly wanting to shut down. 

I just want things to end and I pray God will take me soon so I can see my loved ones again and pets and friends. I don't know how much longer I will be on this earth and all I can say is I tried to hold on. 

Sorry for the long vent. I need someone to hear me out and maybe understands what I'm feeling ATM. Cuz rn I feel super lonely and like I got nobody to talk to. I'm not even kidding about that part. I don't have anyone to tell this too. It's sucks 😔😔 and I just want someone to hear me out.

I hate people being happy with friends or people caring about them because I'm just a jealous lonely loser that is hanging onto my shitty childhood because I have no one left to share good memories with. In a hopeless relationship for four years with an abusive man who I only put up with because I'm terrified of myself of I lived alone.

It won't be the final draft since I may change it once I finalize a plan to end it all by working out the kinks to that plan.

>If you are getting this note, prepare yourself for what you're about to read, but please do not fret. For the past few years, I have been struggling with a battle that involves my mental health and me feeling like I don't want to live anymore. I gave it everything I had. Unfortunately, I have lost that battle. Despite my best efforts, I still lost the battle against life, my situation, and my suicidal thoughts. You might be sad that I'm gone, but just know that I will be in a better place and outside of my suffering once I'm gone. Besides, I feel confident that life would be a lot happier if I was gone.

>P.S.: There is a timeline out there somewhere where things were different. There is a timeline out there where I won this battle and things changed for the better. It's a shame that it couldn't be this timeline."

But every fucking day feels like that scene in every war movie, where someone looks at all the death around them with that thousand yard stare. My eyes feel glassy all the fucking time and if I stop and stare for too long, my ears start ringing. I’m losing presence in my own body. 

But it’s fucking stupid. I haven’t been in a war. I haven’t just watched hundreds of people die, or fought for my life. I just woke up and tried to make it through to the end of the day. That’s not heroic. It’s something most people wake up and do every fucking day without batting an eye. 

Used to be I feel like I’d go through a range of different emotions, even if most of them were shitty and unhealthy. But for a good while now, I’ve just been in this weird state of mostly numb with the last embers of rage smouldering somewhere in me, but it’s too weak now to access now. Sometimes I listen to the right music and that fans the flames a bit, but more than anything that just makes me sad, realising that I’m too numb to even feel rage properly. 

I don’t even know why I’m still here to be honest. There’s no experiences I’m hoping to have, no places I’m hoping to go. I don’t enjoy anything about this life. I’ve isolated myself for years, so no people around to miss me. Seriously, no one. Only had one friend ever anyway. And that was such a turbulent, chaotic shitshow because of me that she doesn’t even talk to me anymore anyway. Made me realise friendships really aren’t for me at least. 

And relationships aren’t either, never had one, don’t want one. Sure maybe sometimes I want sex or honestly mainly just someone to hold, but I can’t handle all the emotional shit you gotta go through to get to that point with someone. Maybe if I could somehow skip the build-up, the getting to know you phase, straight to the part where you’re 100% comfortable with each other like you’ve known each other your whole lives. Skip straight to the part where we she knows me so well that she doesn’t need to ask me questions about my past. Where she knows I don’t wanna talk at all most of the time. Think it’s pretty fucking obvious to see why that doesn’t work and why I’m not ready for relationships. And hell, sometimes I can’t even handle the intimacy part that I claim to actually want, so a relationship would be a mostly negative experience for me.

Just sick of feeling like I’ve got a thousand-yard stare when nothing is even fucking happening to me. Kinda wish it would, at least I’d have a reason to feel like this. Daydream about getting into fights and losing so that I can feel something for a while, feel bruised and bloody and be able to justify feeling traumatised. Used to cut myself but I fucking hate the scars that left so I’m trying not to do that shit. Just fucking hate feeling so fucked just from waking up in the morning."

I thought I overcame it when I attempted suicide and realized all of the things about dying that I was way too afraid to face, but sometimes I fall hard into a suicidal headspace over small instances: getting yelled at, having to clean, needing to cancel/make appointments, etc. With chores, sometimes it's a casual but genuine feeling of ""I'd rather \[insert violent suicidal action\] than clean the bathroom again."" When I get scolded for mistakes, I get so outrageously angry that I threaten to kill myself. But then later that day or the following day, I'll be back to normal. Does that mean I'm still suicidal? Or is it something else? As you can expect, I can't tell any health professionals about this because I'll get taken away, so please don't suggest that."

I can have a completely normal day but I'm always tired. No matter my sleep schedule or lack there off. I'm always tired. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a anxiety related disorder I can't remember. I'm always taking pills to ""help"" me but nothing works. I have a lot of friends but I still feel so alone around them. I have bad trust issues that really makes things difficult. I can't accept when good things happen because it's always torn away from me when I do accept it. I'm just so done with it all.

I'm happy with this girl but we're not even dating. We do couple things while not being in a couple. We used to be but then she said she wasn't ready. So I respected that. Everything is so fucked up constantly. I always find a way to fuck everything up. I just want to be appreciated just a little. I'm tired of being told sorry but I'm still the one who has to be better. Why is it always me. I'm always the one people vent to and I just listen. I'm the one who takes care of people when there sad. I'm the one who listens to people even when I'm the one being yelled and berrated. I'm the one who changes to better suit peoples needs. And I do this to see others happy. But I'm always wrong when I do something to make me happy. I do have a few people who support me and I appreciate them a fuck ton. But they don't always help. A few days ago I was laying in bed crying holding a bottle of pills. I wanted to kill myself so bad and right now I feel the same as I did when that happened. But I put people first again and I didn't kms. I sometimes wish no one cared abt me so I could end it and no one would bat an eye. I'm currently laying in bed trying everything I can to hold on to the few things I love. I do and don't want to die. I want to be rid of all the sadness and anger I just want to not exist but I also want to see my future. I still have goals.

I made a post like this before, and after a few days, realized it wasn't my time yet, and I deleted it.  I graduated high school, made it, I made it to college, and now I can get to work and do this.  Go to graduate school and keep it going.  

It's been almost four years since that time and post.  And where am I?  Out of one great job that I imagined could've been a great stop-gap for my future and manage to help me get started...Then to a job that was exceptionally intensive, but made money and just worked, not the proudest, but the bills got paid.  A somewhat palatable career in college, with nothing too exciting.  But salvageable...then to a mess...now what I imagined what could've been this whole ""comeback season"" in chaos since I just dropped the ball hard on the last eight weeks on two classes.  A short lived friend-become boyfriend who actually cares (maybe??) about me and revived an interest in sports for me and exposed me to many other things with interests that maybe I wouldn't have done so.  But turned into downgrade to I guess ""best friend"" with extended caveats (no not those caveats, just in the manner of socialization and antics).  Which, I guess was fine.  But as I reflect longer and longer about what's happened since when we got together, to realizing it was all a lie and I just lived in some false bliss because they merely ""forgot"" to note that they didn't think we were ""that"" after a bit of time together (even worse, after such a nice night I get such a bomb dropped on me, but more on that later).  Just this entire year has been immensely awful.  And If 2022 becomes this fucking nightmare I have been living since 2018, I'm just so ready to call it quits.  

It's all been such a want to realize I'm older and this new person.  That despite knowing all *too...too well..*, that I am my own worst enemy and I can stop this and right my own ship, and given some resources, and I guess maybe more of an awareness than some others (I'm sorry my friends pain me, even if I love them).  But I look back from then to now.  And nothing has changed.  Except I'm 3 years older, almost 80-100 pounds larger, a car, and whatever feeling of some general sadness, driving me back to I guess contemplating suicide.  Am i proud? Absolutely not.  And this just has become the progression of it all.

Mentally, and I know, everyone has had it worse, but for me, my mind works in a way to remind me of a lot, and it feels like my brain is just a mental scorekeeper.  And it leads me down very dark paths, and one of those paths are now.  I am simply at a point where I don't see it worth it.  Because I can just merely remind myself I can change this, only you can change this, only I can fix this, you are your own cause for your gaffes.  And then a detailed mental account as to how.  But that can never translate to paper, or action.  Writing this feels more like a fucking ramble than any saying of why I feel this way.  Am I just losing it?  Honestly, I want to imagine yes. 

But at this point the one constant in my life is chronic disappointment in things, having to live with and contend with the fact I'm going to be inevitably denied to whatever graduate school I'm doing to, because I can't be consistently proficient in my studies.  What should've been my come back year has turned into 2 As a B- and now two Fs.  I did so well in the beginning of the semester, and then I faltered and fell apart from there.  Just bouts of problems kicks me near the end of the term, so I pass the initial three, and then the mental and emotional fallout turns into an initial strong start and then almost nearly falls apart from there.  And that's what happened.  And finds itself continuing to happen.  And getting into graduate school, or I guess specifically, the line of work I'd like to do, requires performance, which...I've already messed up badly.  So what should've been just a requisite maker in my major is now looking like something I'm going to need to fall back on...And it's...limited, to say the least, unless I lose this massive amount and get in shape for the academy.  Which, let's be real, isn't going to happen.  

And again, it's all my fault, and I know it is.  And will never not be my fault.  But how after all this time have I not managed to competently handle myself and reign myself in academically, when I did so in High School, to much better results, astonishes me.  Yet...This is life.  

It feels like since like April everything's been on such a downhill spiral, and yeah, it wasn't pretty beforehand, but the specter of academia also joined in to kick me while I was down with the revelations of my prior, I guess?? now/former-relationship.  We were together from july until *I thought* April.  And we have this one set of feelings, and we are generally without change, and since then.  Nothing changed in terms of like acts, or sayings, etc.  We weren't big into yelling I love yous or whatever, we more knew it and saw it through.  Fine, and I guess we used ""really like"" **far too liberally**, as I realized, when I made myself look like an ass that night.  But since it, was he more detached, yes.  Which fine, not everyone is into like being as brazen about things, and I'm not going to throw myself at someone needlessly and make him uncomfortable.  But honestly, it felt like he didn't really listen to me, and even when it was mutually real.  And I took it.  It wasn't smart to, but eventually I would get it out and say there's an issue and say something about it.  

And fine.  I chalked it up to that, we did things together, I believed it was all right, maybe once we got out of college, or once i get to grad school, we could blow this place and do something.  And I guess that was the thought.  But god he was so vague.  In april, after a nice night of discussing and reminiscing, I just find it in asking ""what does he think we are, and how does he truly feel.  I genuinely wanted to pop the love word and just get it over with (yes, it was a long time to, but we were looking to take a long route anyway).  And he said we were better off as friends, and that's okay.  I agreed in part, we didn't do anything crazy anyway, just out of lack of means, and spent time together.  But then comes off with the ""i thought i said this in December"".  Which mentally killed me and my confidence.  

And I went through everything to show otherwise, and he didn't.  I realized I was living a lie that this piece of shit led me to live.  And I just felt broken, but I realized what was there.  It's really just me, and three friends from HS I still talked to, but two I can/can't stand, and one which unfortunately is busy.  And notwithstanding this, I accepted it.  I took a day to myself and drive, but my brain from then-on just throws the question.  What could I have done better to communicate how I felt, and I did.  And I know I did.  But I chalked him up to being the more silent type, which he is.  But I felt betrayed.  But the circumstances of the matter give way that everything was going well anyway, and we were practically best friends, and I lived with it.  And I live with it now.  But now I'm answering regretting not taking the time for myself, and I found myself in moments I'm dissatisfied this turn into large scale disagreements or me blowing up in the form of text.  And that's just not a way to live.  But overall, I want to imagine they are more good for my life than bad, because honestly, aside from the moments he genuinely is a great person.  I just wished that I was able to fix everything, and return to this sense of blissful ignorance.  Or bliss.  The one person in my life that makes me feel/felt secure, and I can only sit there knowing this is really the best I'm gonna get.  And honestly.  They are at this point the only reason I feel alive, or want to be.  Because they are genuinely great, outside of moments.  But how do you love someone you wish you could hate, but don't want to hate, and genuinely don't.  And just wish they could meet you more halfway, without truly threatening to let them go, and sound like hot shit, but you know the ball of them speaking to me is in my court, and I've toed this line for so long, and I'm scared to lose them at the worst point in my life and then it really will be over.  

And yes, I got used to it, my feelings for him in that capacity was gone, but recently, those feelings came back, and I really wish there was a chance to get back together.

But it gets harder to speak to him in terms of my problems, aside from random rants about the day or things he likes, because I feel like I feel sidestepped.  He's progressing (or is really good at masking it), and I am here just emotionally regressing.  And just academically regressing.  I used to say everything to him, even my growing lack of wanting to do it all, but how much do I reveal to a someone if I don't want to make them look like I'm using them as my therapist?  And I don't want to be more toxic than I probably already am.  

And just life, I'm going through a bad financial situation, but I feel like a financial burden to my family, but I know if I overload myself again, I'm going to regain the burnout of work I had, and truly, 3am-3pm is not a job for me.  But everywhere I look, this is what I'm getting.  Right as the pandemic got worse, I was laid off, and for good reason, because work made me feel just as suicidal sometimes because of the massive sacrifice in quality of life, and just the burnout, which also massively affected my grades, much more significantly than my moments of now. 

But I find myself staying in bed longer and longer, mentally tired in a person I know, in a right mind, I wouldn't be, but also in part, so.  Knowing I can never stop to truly think clearly, because my brain just wants me to relive everything wrong I've done in my life for years and asking if I did otherwise, would it have been better?  And does it get better?  I want to keep saying 'I'm trying!' but increasingly, I don't think I want to try anymore.  

I don't even want to wake up anymore most days.  Much less in this farce of a vacation.  

I just feel like I had a chance for an out, and maybe if 17 year old me knew how much of a clusterfuck 21 year old me is, maybe he would've saved the time for the both of us.  But I don't want to think that way.  I really, really don't!  But it feels like I've been getting the short end of the stick for so long, I am just slowly having enough of it.  And seeing how a piece of shit family member is back in my life, and just how more semi in better shape than I am, despite being a moronic piece of shit, having their person hang around me, or in such close proximity, just infuriates me more.  

2021 was so god awful.  But is it really a point in fighting, something I've taken as a point of pride when even you want to just take the team out in a blowout game in 4th and 10, but everyone is staring at you to go for it?  If not, you would've failed.  

And I'm just so done.  But I want to imagine this is just my want to scream, and as loudly as possible.  But somedays, and since the 23rd, it's becoming increasingly an ""I'm done"".  And I'm lying to myself to bide time for a false hope something good will happen in my life when it's been a mess for so long."

I was the chubby black girl in a 99% white populated town, i now go to a high school in the same town, i handled the racism as well as i could and it didn’t bother me, until i became a closeted racist towards myself (i hate being black with my whole soul if i could be a white girl i’d literally give anything in the universe just to have white skin) i love black people and dark-skin people i just hate hate hate myself, maybe if i didn’t look like this i wouldn’t be hated..? anyways i got anorexic in about grade 8 and lost 70 pounds in 4 months, I’m still losing weight because i started medication for my ADHD which also didn’t help, i always thought i was weird or different, and ofc i was different but it almost felt like i was isolated, i had friends of course and people were nice but i always thought something was wrong with me, when i was younger my biological dad left me and i always thought it was because of me, he’s a diagnosed Narcissist and i see why… now I’m scared i might be one and i can’t go on like this, i just do terrible things and my family doesn’t want to be around me at this point ,  i can’t hold myself accountable, i can’t not be depressed i can’t do it right and i try, i try so hard and i still fail and this is the one thing i might not fail at? And another sob story is i actually did lose a boyfriend, a rn it’s not like “he was one the one “ but in my 15 years of living he was the only person to actually show me I’m worth it, his compliments weren’t fake, his smile was real it was so so real and then his mom told me I’m “too young to date “ even though I’m going to be driving soon.. for the most part though i see my life as a lost cause, my self harm counter is at almost at 300 days and yet every day i just want it all to reset, or maybe just have myself reset, all i ever talk about is wanting everyone to hate me so no one misses me when i die, even my own mom… and it may not be right so be saying these things but i don’t want her to miss me .. at all, she had me at 17 and i wish she didn’t all i bring us bad shit , why didn’t she listen to everyone when they said not to have me…"

All people do is parrot the same bullshit over and over about how beautiful life is and how it’s worth it and how things get better and how all you need is treatment. That’s all fine and good and probably true for most people. What happens when it isn’t true for you? What happens when treatment doesn’t work after years and years and years of trying? What happens after the oh-so-perfect doctors and specialists give up on you? 

Nothing happens. You get labeled as a lazy piece of shit that “just isn’t trying hard enough.” As if, if I just wanted to be happy a little more and worked a little harder, all my problems would go away. Guess what? That’s fucking bullshit. Until the world stops hating me for who I am and things that I cannot change, and until I stop having to count every single penny I earn at my terrible job in order to be able to eat, I’m not going to be happy. Who the fuck would? I live a life of humiliation and subsistence and I’m supposed to be grateful for that?

Well, I’m not. I don’t want it. This life is not a “gift” it’s a curse that was forced upon me. I never asked to be born and I sincerely wish I hadn’t been. I’m not interested in another year of bullshit so this seems like the perfect time to end it. The only thing I’m scared of is the possibility of nothingness after this life….but then again, if there’s nothing then I guess I won’t even know. I just hope reincarnation is real and that I’m not reborn as a human. I’d rather be an ant getting stomped to death on the concrete than live the life of a human being in 2022. 

Cheers to everyone else that is sick to fucking death of the bullshit that is existing as a regular person day to day. May we all find peace some way or another, I already know how I’m going to find mine."

I do not have a reason to write this, I am just suddenly very sad. I spent a few days with my family for Christmas, it was hard but it made me realize how much I love my dad. I am worried what will happen to him when I go. My sisters are both a bit estranged from him, and I think he is lonely. My stepmother is a wonderful person, but I get the feeling they are having a rocky patch. He is also having a lot of health problems, and I think is feeling depressed.

When I was little, I was his least favorite in kind of obvious way. It was bit painful, but I did understand, I am disabled and was always angry and getting in trouble as a kid. But after he left my mom, my sisters could not forgive him. I do logically know what he did was not great, but I also understand how he felt very well, and because I never expected him to stay for me, I think I do not feel it as such a visceral slight as my sisters do. 

I lived with him for a while as a kind of bachelors life before he got remarried, and we talked a lot since then. He is probably the only person I feel comfortable being angry around, and the only person who is able to put up with me when I am angry. He looks after me a lot, and I think he wishes I would let him do more. A few months ago, a few things he said made me worried he was terminally ill, so I called him and made him promise to say the truth, and then asked if he was sick. He was actually ok, he just had shingles, but he seemed really touched that I was worried. I felt very sad, because I know that feeling of surprise when someone cares, but I never thought he would feel that way, and I am sad he would be so lonely.

I cannot stick around just for him. But I feel very sad to think of him after I go. I am worried my sisters will never forgive him. I am worried he will have a very painful and lonely life after I go. I know I am not his only connection, but I am worried he will cut himself off from world after I go.

In fact my sister sent me a very mean text last night telling me how “I’m weird and just like everyone else and to leave her alone because we’re not sisters anymore” my mom took her side. It feels like they’re ganging up on me.

She made dinner, to my sister “you want some of this boo boo” with a sickening smirk. To me “do you want some of this” and rolls her eyes when I say no. 

“You’ve been acting weird for a month” I wonder fucking why. I quit smoking weed, a habit they enabled because it made me nicer to be around. I’m also struggling with nicotine addiction, depression and anxiety. They can see it but they don’t care I don’t understand why? “Your life ain’t that bad, get over yourself” don’t you think I know that? I’d do anything not to feel like this. I can’t help it, I don’t mean to be mean.

I’m struggling and it all just hurts so bad, everything. I’m trying I even exercised and ate a salad today. But nothing helps. I’m so empty and alone.  I’m starting to feel like I’m the crazy one, like I’m the problem, like I’d just be better of dead. Maybe I’ll go to hell, maybe not, maybe after I take my final breathe I’ll finally get to experience the all consuming dark void and I won’t feel anything anymore. They won’t miss me, or they’d see how bad I’m hurting.

When I was 5/6 year old I would ask God if he would kill me ""God let me sleep n not wake up."" Later I began not believing in God anymore, because he never helped me. 

From the day I stopped believing in God I thought I should kill myself, but the thoughts were only ideations until for some days ago. 

I had a really bad day n thought I would do it. I planned it all. I jumped in my lawliet cosplay, set up notes on small printed pride flags n hided notes, which I hoped that my friends n the police would find. I made it all look nice (sat on my green carpet with flowers, my pride flags n crystals around me) n wrote my suicide letter in the death note. I took black nail paint on, handcuffed myself to my bed. Took a deep breath. O looked under my bed. The kitchen knife were still under the wooden boards. I grabbed the knife. I was ready to die: I had the knife in my hand n just needed to cut. I had read all about where to cut to die fast. I placed the knife on the spot where I needed to cut, but I just couldn't cut through my skin. The feeling of my skin against the knife gave me a feeling of nausea. I sat with the knife for a long time, but then gave up n burned all the things the next day. 

I also do SH- Just not on the typical way, idk why I can't cut my skin open with a knife if I can bite or scratch it open. Someone having the same experience, or is it just me? 

After this episode, I thought I would just jump down a big building. In my town there has just come a new big building, which I could easily jump from n be sure to die, but I don't like the thought of my body landing in the street so everyone can see it. But on the other side it doesn't matter, because I will be deadXD

I just also don't want to die. I just want everything to go away. I feel like I'm born in the wrong world as the wrong person. I just want to feel better n be somewhere else. I want to be free. My mother says I'm suicidal because I want attention, but I'm suicidal because life right now sucks. I know it will get better in the future, but it seems soo long away n I am afraid it won't get much better even if I leave my abusers. I hate living with EDNOS, insomia, quiet BPD, anxiety, tics, CPTSD, autism, ADHD n depression.

 I have lost a sense of identity. I don't know what I like anymore. There is nothing I want to do with my life. We get born to start on an education, work, have kids, work even more, retire n die. I don't want that. I want to be a wizard, fly on a dragon named Bee n live happily in my castle in the forests. I wouldn't be me anymore, I would be a shapeshifter, who could jump between different being in different worlds n bodies. This may be because I haven't a sense of self because of BPD. I don't even remember most of my childhood because of repressed memories. My middle school life was one big dissociation, were I almost only remember walking around on the hallway in the breaks so I wouldn't have to deal with anyone.

I have social anxiety, so I don't know if I will answer all of you, but don't worry, I won't yeet myself right now. It's my first post ever on Reddit. It's a v big step so I think I will get anxious, but I believe it's important for me to do.

You can call me L ~He/they/it~ 🍋🍋🍋"

I don’t wanna see 2022.

Once it happens, they will move on. I will be gone. It will be a relief for them. 

It will be a relief for me. 


I don’t know what happens after death, but that’s something I should find out soon. 


I’m young and all, but it’s not worth finding out what may happen later in life. 

“You have a future ahead of you” “you are loved by someone” 


No, I’m ugly, I am rotting, I am useless in many ways. I have no true reason to be here. 


I will always be lonely, I will always fail, I will always be the person everyone abuses. I will always have a good heart as long as I’m still here.  


I know no one cares on here, but I just feel like saying this.

Once they're gone I'll have nothing. Nothing left keeping me here. So I've decided that when they're gone that is when I will do it. I don't know how long that will be but I've made up my mind and there's no changing it. So with that in mind doesn't anyone have suggestions on a semi-painless method? Hell, that's not that big a deal either truly I just need something that is sure to work. I was thinking that I'd need/want to do it someplace where they can find me afterward so it won't be a burden on anyone.

I feel stuck and I’m sick of living. I wish they didn’t care about me so I can just kill myself already. I’m sick of being a toxic friend and a horrible person.

I know I haven't done it yet, because I'm too selfish for that and because it would hurt me so much to know what would happen to my parents in the future. But since then, things didnt improve. Ups and Downs that I was able to control, but I am more than ever closer to the edge. 

In my penultimate year of college, in addition to being bullied by my housemates and after 3 years of an unstable relationship, I lost what was then the love of my life to a girl from France. Since then, I started to consume alcohol to feel something, until I had a car accident. Then I promised my parents that I would stop drinking, which I didn't. I got into a relationship where I was only used for sex. 

When I found myself, I was a person I didn't know and I left everything, I started seeing the Psychiatrist and taking care of myself, until the specialty exam started. I stayed at home studying and smoking, had no friends and was ashamed to go to the gym, despite paying an absurd bill a month for almost a year. 

I took the exam but I didn't study enough and got a bad grade. A note that only allowed me to go into Internal Medicine, a specialty that, in short, is not worth it. Currently in my third year of internship, I feel that I just make mistakes (I've never put anyone at risk). I serve as a telephone operator to give family members informations of theis loved ones and serve as a boxing bag and fire extinguisher for specialists.

I gradually lost my will to live. In the last 6 months, I gained 10 kilos, taking refuge in food and spending most of my time in bed. I dont wear makeup or dress accordingly to society. Tracksiuts are my life and black. The color black. 

I have arguments with my superiors simply because I didn't say Good Morning at the entrance to an infirmary to do a simple test. Or because I'm aggressive talking to my co-workers because i am tired and frustrated with everything.  

Why I chose this specialisty? Because it was the only one available for me. 

I know perfectly well that I have all the criteria for major depression with associated suicidal ideation. What it should do now is go to a Psiquiatrist, take anti-depressants and behavioral therapy. But I don't have the money for that. And I don't like the person I become under Seretonin Receptor Inhibitors.

So 2022 is probably going to be my last year, at my job, in the world or both. I'm done."

i always have to put on a happy face so people don't have to worry about me. pff- it's not like they would worry about me if i showed them how i felt anyway. i've had people tell me i was so lucky to be this happy. 

yeah, i am so fucking lucky. i am so lucky to write suicide notes every fucking week just to burn them after. i am so lucky to do self harm. i am so lucky to fantasize about my death every day. i am so lucky that i have this empty hole in my chest that makes it hard to breathe. i am so fucking lucky to pretend every emotion i seem to have. it's awfully ironic.

and the worst part is... man... nobody notices. even if i try to tell someone how i spend my days, they don't believe me. they think i'm melodramatic. funny, because this makes me to want to kill myself even more. i feel like this is the only way they'll know. 

i want people to feel guilty about how they never gave a shit about me. i've listened to countless people about their depression, helped people with their suicidal thoughts, but never got that help back. i want to make them feel guilty about how they refused to pay me back. i know i sound toxic but... it almost feels like revenge, y'know?

i don't know when, but my death is soon. that's all i know."

I am suicidal every day but my CMHT (who I have upcoming initial assessment with), A&E, + GP won't prescribe me anything other than SSRI, which I tried like 10 of and which do not work for me. I don't understand what I am supposed to do. It could be 2-3 months before I see a psych, I just want some one of authorized status to sign off on a mood stabilizer or an maoi or a benzo or anything that is more ""serious"" than the soccer-mom class drugs which do not do anything. According to the DSM I am stage 6 suicidal because I am active in my will to suicide recently, eg browsing darknet sites for heroin that I could take in one go (no tolerance) to kill me. So it is serious. I need something to stabilize me and I feel I am totally abandoned by nhs.

What do you think is the solution? Even in october I overdosed on a med and was just sent back to gp and couldn't at the A&E speak with anyone able to practice medicine to prescribe things.

There just must be someone who can fasttrack a prescription I don't even want the assessments or to take anyone's time"

They payed for my tuition and give me a monthly allowance. When they noticed that I was struggling academically they hired 2 tutors to meet with me weekly costing a few hundred each week. At this point they're paying thousands for me so I can have the best life they can give me. But I failed them, I failed every single class in my first semester crippling my GPA to below a 1.0. Thousands wasted. On top of that I've also costed them thousands when I crashed the family car twice and insurance skyrocketed. I could've been great, they gave me everything to succeed.

I doubt there is ever a place to talk about it and i'll never get my answers but I am so tired. I've been posting in this sub for years now so you can tell just how I'm fucking sick of living.

I can't harm myself because when I got a cut two days ago from falling down a ladder, I panicked when I saw blood. The cut wasn't even deep but I lost it. Now how the fuck am I ever going to end it if I couldn't even stand such small injury?

I obviously have other methods that doesn't need sharp objects but the success rate is probably also 1% and I'm not taking that risk.

I'm 18 years old and live in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. My friend lives in Thuringia. So the only contact we have atm is via our smartphones. This makes it even more complicated...

I first heard about two weeks ago. He came up to me on WhatsApp like we always do... And told me he had suicidal thoughts... For one because he feels guilty that the group he was in (a little camp) broke up and second he feels guilty that his relationship with his girlfriend broke up.

When he was in America a few months ago... Was... October? When he was there, he had held a pistol to his head and wanted to pull the trigger. He did.. The gun did not go off due to a defect.

Then he tried hanging himself in his room while he still was there (he lived at his father's house)... His father found him before he could do it.

When he told me that I was shocked... I was on the verge of crying... I blamed myself... For not not noticing it sooner.

So now I'm sitting here on my phone... Writing those lines... Chatting with him... Telling him how much I love him as a friend... How much I'd miss him... That I don't want to loose him that way... My hands are shaking... My heard is pounding...

Can anyone help me? Tell me how to behave or what to do because I can only see it through my phone.

If I could... I would embrace him... And don't want to let go... Because I don't want him to do anything to himself again..."

Recently I've been thinking about suicide a lot. And it sound so easy when I think about it, no special feelings, just grab the rope and hang in the garage, and it's done. Why? I am afraid to leave though but it sounds so easy to end myself. I've read about overdoses and such but when you do there's a big chance of surviving... Or jumping. 

I've thought about a hose from my exhaust into my car, that way it would be sleeping death. But still afraid to do it. Something in me doesn't want, I guess it's the survival instinct. 

Nobody really knows about this problem of mine. I used to go to psychologists but it was rather annoying than helping. This was a year ago. 

I just felt like venting on reddit because telling it to people in real gives weird reactions."

It's always been hard, it seems, or at least that's a continuous  theme  that has been running for as long as I can remember, but....whew, it has gotten so hard, and I am so so so tired. 

At this point, It's hard to remember not being so tired, worn in spirit and heart. I've just felt an unyielding wave of resignation and the desolation of faith in the human spirit. I don't know how to come back from this. I don't know that I ever will. 

A few years ago a kid brother of mine was murdered, stabbed, multiple times, while just doing his job, The shock of it destroyed me. I am still destroyed, I am very good at pretending though, so the majority of people that know me don't notice, too much anyway. His was not the first, by far, and then would not be the last. In this city that just...EATS people. Everyone, it eats everyone eventually. Perhaps thats entropy.

With his death flew the last of my faith. I'm not religious. I dare say, not really even spiritual, at least anymore. But with him flew my last faith in humanity, The human spirit, A collective drive, subconscious direction of life, a purpose, beyond a relentless chaos in an empty void that happened to spawn a horror of consciousness to witness it's cruelty even without the capacity to notice, let alone care, 

And I am just so so so Goddamned Tired. 

If I had your faith, I could make it safe and clean  
If only I was sure,   
That my head on the door  
Was a dream...."

Even as things slowly improve in my life, I still can’t shake the feeling of suicidal thoughts and the irrational fear of ending up alone.

Since high school, I have gone through many different changes mentally. I am more open to talking to others and my conversational skills have significantly improved. I no longer feel extreme anxiety when talking to new people, although a little bit of anxiety is still there. I still have a few instances of suicidal thoughts, and it just so happens that they are occurring tonight as I write this.

I fear that I have too many hangups about myself that will make me undesirable to others. I am afraid that my personal insecurities might come out to anyone I might get intimate with in the future. At the moment, I can never imagine myself having a serious relationship with anyone, and this is pretty much why I am still awake tonight.

One thing I would like to improve on is the physical aspect of my well-being. I would like to lose weight and start improving myself physically. Having a constant routine whether it is through dieting or exercise is something I greatly struggle with. Procrastination and browsing the internet on my phone too much is another problem of mine that I struggle to work on. 

I live in my head far too much. I want to feel hopeful about my future, and I want these suicidal thoughts to just disappear completely. Just wanted to post this here to get my thoughts off of my chest."

Today is harder than, not easier. This pain is unbearable. There is one family who are friends with my family, but also my husband’s family. They didn’t comfort me at all on Christmas Day, but today I heard from two of them. They said my husband is so proud of me. He told them. He was proud of me for leaving him to become my own person. He told me, but to swallow his price and tell others means so much to me. 

Update 1

I just got his name tattooed on my ring finger. We always talked about doing it, but never did. 

TRIGGER 

I so badly want to die. I found my husband dead Christmas Day. He shot himself in the head. They dragged me off his body. I called his mom to let her know and his family came and accused me of killing him to my face. 

I didn’t shoot him, but he did it bc of me. I spent all day Christmas with his blood still on me. I don’t know what is worse, being dragged off of him or being accused of killing this man I loved so deeply. 

This pain and loneliness is breaking my heart and I wish I could just do the same, but we have children. I can’t leave them without a parent."

Having it wasn't nearly as bad as I personally thought it would be for all the fear mongering, however maybe I'm healthier than I thought? Either way society is not healthy. They feed you pills to fit their idea of normal (complacent) and stop you from realizing what is really going on around you. The worst symptom I've had during COVID is the overwhelming desire to kill myself. I've been suicidal since before the pandemic started but now it's like being suicidal is the only thing that makes sense. Every day is a fight that isn't meant to be won. You either start off rich or you're better off dead. No point in trying to talk to people or change anything because America has shown its true colors dozens of times over these few years and still, nothing.

They killed themselves looooong ago. Or died of an overdose, or crashed their car drunk. guess what, it didn’t get better for them.  They just died. 

For the record: I’m very very sad and depressed right now but would never have the balls to kill myself.

I know everything is self inflicted and its all my own fault and im terrified to have to admit it to someone. I know if i tell anyone about how i feel theyll see how stupid and pathetic it is. Im such a fucking hypocrite. 
The only thing that made me happy for the past few years ive now been called delusional for it. It cant make me happy anymore, not after this. Nothing else brings me any joy or excitement. Ive tried setting short goals to live for but nothing interests me. i can barely keep going just for my friend. i dont want to make them sad but im so tired. i dont want to burden them with worrying about me, ive already done enough. ive already been selfish enough. I wish i could just end it already. i dont see myself living any longer. best case scenario is two months at most. i hate myself more than i care about anyone close to me. i just know it wont get that much better. i dont want to get better. its stupid and i hate it i just wish things could go to before this happened and stay that way. its pathetic that i wont get help even though i know i should and want to. even if i know i can live and get past this i wont really be living ill just be going through each day not feeling or enjoying anything. I wont be as happy as i was again. im making myself helpless and i hate it so much. taht was always my problem. wanting to get help but refusing to do it. i really should just die already. ive written my goodbye letters. i wish i could just do it already"

Came back to town, got a new job found and a place to live. Ended up starting on the road to getting back together with my girl, after I offered to help her repair her chicken coop. She asked me earlier this week to come over for NYE. This was very exciting to me because I love her a ton. Then she went radio silent today until she responded at midnight to a check-in text that I’m still her favorite person but that she’s ready to move on and has started seeing someone.

I’m 46 years old with a shit job as phone tech support, living in an illegal basement studio apartment with no savings and a sociopathic ex-wife who tightly controls my ability to see my kids and thus my life. I am also bipolar 1, and though medicated, i do occasionally lose it. I also have some minor tics and major migraine headaches from previous TBIs. I’m desperately afraid that I have nothing to offer and am going to spend my waning years alone before succumbing to dementia.

I think I should kill myself."

I can’t listen. 
I am stupid and don’t do great in school. 
I can’t spell/read  well for my age to the point my mom asked if I think I have a learning disability.
I am black in America so no one cares.
I have weird panic attacks when I get stressed out/ in trouble.
I am always tired/I hate being awake. 
I am lonely and no matter how many “friends” I make the feeling doesn’t go away.
I hate change. 
I can’t see a future for myself.
I hate waking up. 
I can’t control my emotions. 
I don’t see my self being happy/happy with anyone. 
I hate being left alone with my thoughts it can get really scary.
I know my mom/ family has high hopes for me and I don’t think I will ever able to live up to it. 
I just can’t anymore and I don’t know what to do with myself. 
If i was gone I could be free of these feelings but I know that would just push it on to someone else. 
I don’t know how I’m going to make it on me own    

I hate being alive at this point I just sleep all day as a substitute for killing myself, 
And what’s the point of being alive anyway, my mom can just have the other kid that she wants so bad and I can just end it.
I hate myself anyway so what is the point of being here it is not like I will amount to anything anyway.

I say all of this but I know I can’t do it.I tried once and the amount of guilt that I felt afterwards was scary so I think I am just going to do what I do most night and suffer in silence."

They call me lazy say I should get up and do something but can’t I relax just for once I’ve done so much but it’s never enough it’s like I can never live up for their expectations 

They want me to be something when I grow up, I don’t know what they’d do if I killed my self not much probably 

My brother has always been better they’ve always compared us and we never had a good relationship so I just gave up, I mean, why be the favorite if it so tiring

I forgot about my physical well being stopped taking showers to the point my parents would force me too, stopped brushing my teeth their an ugly shade of yellow and I know I have so many cavities, I stopped clipping my nails and even eating for a while 

And then everything became too much I stopped eating and then my dad noticed he started coming up to my room and leaving food there I knew what he was trying to do so I ate to make him happy and then just like that he thought I was better 

He began leaving me alone again didn’t take any notice when I’d ‘lose my pencil sharper’ every other month or when I’d block myself in my room for days with no showers 

All that he cares is that I don’t have a fucking eating disorder 

He’d ask about my brothers mental health daily ‘oh how’s your brother?’ ‘did you notice your brother seems kinda down?’ ‘You should buy your brother a gift’

He is in the second grade or third grade and has always been cheerful but changed recently. Apparently he opened up to his parents first and now their marriage is also falling apart. N one really knows what to do about it because he is so young and this is a first in our family. He is also became a middle child recently after his little sister was born. If you know about solutions that could possibly help please let me know.

I’m no one’s favorite, they might say it to me but around others there’s always someone else, it’s never me. 
I was always bullied for how I look like , all my life, how come am I being called hot by girls now? Am I being just used? Am I catfishing without knowing? Am I just being lied to so I don’t feel bad? 
I’m never someone’s priority. I used to see myself in the life of somebody, a life where we have fun and we get married and have kids and family, But not anymore. Not cuz I don’t love them anymore or cuz they don’t love me. I do love them still and even if they loved me, I just can’t see it happening. I’m just not deserving of anything. 
I hate the feeling of being cheated on even tho it never happened to me, I’ve seen the heartbreaks on other people and it scares me because I’m too fragile, and no one cares. I’m always being told to suck it up, and yeah I should but I didn’t grow up like that, to just sick things up, I grew up with a mom and a sister and a tiny part of my life had somewhat of a dad figure telling me to respect women and that’s it. I never had someone to tell me to stand for myself. Only mom’s shoulder to cry onto.
I hate myself, I truly hate myself. I grew to be a liar cuz I’m too afraid of people’s reaction to the truth so I lie cuz I know what wouldn’t make a bad reaction. I really need someone to love me and I know people will say “just wait there’s gonna be someone who loves you don’t you worry” but that’s not true, and even if it is who says it’s gonna work? No one.. I’m just gonna be alone forever.. with no one. I don’t have anybody to talk to about my day or feelings.. no one actually cares and actually wants to listen.. I talk a lot cuz I have a lot to say, no one has time for me or patience.. after a day or two I’ll just get ignored.. I don’t want a therapist or a psychiatrist because I don’t want my surroundings to know. And I don’t want to talk about anything with someone in person from my country, since the native language isn’t English it’s so much harder for me to explain them and simply I can’t express my feelings in that language.. my true pain.. anyways I’m literally just mumbling, the whole point is that I’m worthless and no one wants me and no one will ever want me I’m dumb and as a partner I’m jealous and obsessive and possessive and very protective and just no girl likes any of that but I’m so scared to be cheated on and don’t trust anyone, I wish I was loved and cared for… I just wish I was someone’s priority.. I’m no one’s priority.
It’s so hard to see how someone special to you just prioritizes someone else, someone who you know wouldn’t be there for them like you would. Someone that’s there for the moment but not for the future, and they don’t get it. And they rather spend time with them, and not with you.. they just leave you like you’re nothing, and then come back to you when the other person left or smth.. and when you beg them for hours to talk to you, they won’t leave their friend, but when they want to talk to them they’ll leave you without a single hesitation.. it just sucks to see how I’m being prioritized, it makes me feel sick. I’m so unwanted in peoples life I don’t see the point of continuing.
If I’m no one important in anyones life what’s the point I keep breathing, I’m just wasting oxygen.. I actually hate my life and who I am."

I’ve been rejected left out and used by people I am constantly pressured by said abusive mom to get extremely high grades which just ends up making me fail from pressure and I also procrastinate so it doesn’t help. My sister hates me and constantly blackmails me and my friends make me feel like shit and constantly pressure me to do things I don’t want to like making me vape once. I’m really nervous around people but feel pressured to talk to them I have a lot of “friends” but I hate them so damn much.

My dad is a massive asshole that’s just out of the picture I haven’t talked to him in 6 months despite him calling once cause he’s never been there for me. I always feel like I’m just not as important as other people like I’m never gonna make an impact In the world so I should just die already. I feel pressured from everyone around me and dying feels like my only escape. Winter break is hell but I don’t want to return to school either because I feel like I’m at the edge of a mental breakdown and that’ll lead to me S*iciding but I  never do it cause I’m a fucking coward I just want to end it all without pain but I’m scared of there truly being a hell because that’s where I’m going to be for being such a bad person and wasting my life when I have everything a normal person should but messing it all up. Life has been a sick fucking joke to me and I just need someone to talk to, someone who’ll understand and not judge me for wanting to die. Someone please help me."

It has recently come to a head where my therapist wants me to take a medical leave from work and enter an in Patient mental health program. 

I have been talking to my husband about it and he thinks that my therapist and I are being over dramatic. He is concerned that we cannot financially support me taking a leave of absence from work and thinks that I just need to try harder. 

My husband is a perfectionist, a former marine, and a police officer. He likes the house to be clean and orderly and he gets frustrated when it isn’t. I recently have been struggling so bad that I am choosing between showering and doing the dishes (I always choose the dishes to make my husband happy) which means that today was the first time I showered since before Christmas. 

I told my husband that I could potentially avoid taking a medical leave if I could do the therapy in the evenings after work meaning I wouldn’t really help with the house or the kids. I told him the number 1 thing I needed from him was to not let his frustration show with the process. Instead, I needed him to be supportive, happy, and jovial otherwise I would feel like a burden and the whole process wouldn’t work. He said “how am I supposed to act like you aren’t a burden when you are refusing to do anything to stop being a burden”. 

This confirmed to me that I am making his life worse and not better. I am not and have never been actively suicidal and I wouldn’t want to do anything to take me away from my daughters. But I want to stop burdening my husband with my bullshit and I can’t figure out how. It feels completely hopeless at this point. I know that one day soon my husband will wake up and realize he doesn’t have to deal with this shit and just leave me. Part of me even wishes he would just to save himself. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for with this post. I just needed to get it all off my chest. I want to be better. I want to feel good. I just wish I knew how."

Then I'll cry.

I don't want to die, I want to run away from everything and be happy but I just can't right now. I had made a friend this year in July. We bonded so quick and we actually started to like each other. We would talk all day and all night, it felt like he actually cared and that made me feel happy. But one week he said he was too exhausted to talk to me, and four days in he meets someone who he falls for. He didn't understand why I was mad, didn't understand why I couldn't be happy for him.

How could I? He was the only person that ever made me happy. All the moments we had feel like they mean nothing to him.

I wish I could leave him behind just so I could get over this pain, but he wants to be friends and I feel we still connect. Except I freaked out today because of how shit it was and he tried to be there for me but then he just stopped talking to me. I feel like I'm too much for him now, like the person who said ""I'm here for you, no matter what"" suddenly isn't there for me anymore. It makes me not want to wake up, it makes me wish I could just end everything cuz I wanted to be happy, I fell for him. But life always takes what makes me happy.

Edit: sometimes it helps to say what's on my mind, even tho it doesn't paint a full picture of the situation. I was going through some mental duress and my brain was throwing all it could at me because I tried to be positive for a good while. I don't agree with this text now that I am clear headed, i feel differently. A nap usually helps me out of these ruts sometimes."

What was the point of me writhing in agony as a teenager with a panic attack that would last for hours, going to the psych ward multiple times, losing most of my friends, getting religious based OCD and thinking I was going to hell for breathing while having a bad thought (I would hold my breath until I cleared the bad thought,  or I  thought I was condoning it)?  Was the point because the universe is evil, because God has a sick sense of humor?  Who knows.

I cnat live without friends. constantly reminiscing about how much better things used fo be. never looking forward to anything. I just graduated graphic design school and during it that was my purpose. now I have nothing to get me out of bed. I try to be happy. It always ends with me sobbing myself to sleep. every night. panicj attack after panick afttack. I have no hope. nothing is driving me forward. happyness is short lived and always wends kn me wanting to put a bullet in my brain. idm what to fo anymore. pills dont even help

I have meds that work somewhat well but that doesn't matter if I am constantly triggering myself to make myself upset and anxious. I guess I feel comfort in this sadness. I WANT to go back to a mental hospital just so I can be around people that truly understand me. I want to go back to the mental hospital because I felt more happier in there then I have ever felt in my whole entire life. I hate feeling like shit because of my self destructive behaviors. I do think I will get better I just think it's going to take more work than I'm willing to put in at this moment. To be able to get better you have to want to get better and there is still a small part of me that doesn't want to get better. People say try using coping skills and I say ""they don't work"" but really I just don't want them to work. My mom truly deserves better she is trying so hard to make somebody that doesn't fully want to get better happy and I hate it. I wish I wanted to get better but I don't. I just relapsed on self harm like half and hour ago and oh I really did miss self harming. I miss the blood, the burning sensation, and the trying to hide the self harm, basically everything about self harm I miss. I miss the mental hospital. I just got out of Residential almost a month ago so I don't really want to go back. But I do want to go to a short-term hospital for like a week but I'm scared of getting sent back to long-term in the end. I'm afraid of starting up the cycle of going in and out of mental hospitals. But at the same time I really miss it and I genuinely don't know what to do.!<"

Grades slipped, I graduated with middling results. University is hard as fuck, I was expelled two or three times, I don't even remember, it's so hazy. Now just failing to properly take a shower, making a sandwich is so freaking hard, you cannot just blame it on laziness. Now 28. Brain fog so severe a toddler would win me over in a reasoning competition. I just fail. Ok, jumped out of a window half a year ago. Dug myself a deeper hole. Now my legs are weak, prolly because I broke my spine in four places. At least I can walk. Now just pacing around the room, doing nothing. Music brings no pleasure, movies I gave up on since I lost patience to sit through a movie. Have no will to go outside and just take a walk, since nothing brings me a feeling. It's like staring at a brick wall. I don't want to end up in a nursing home.

I still hate that even after all of that I still love this person who shitted on me after I told her how rough my holiday was. Because why would someone you love do that to you? Why? I keep asking myself everyday while trying not to end it all. My birthday is next month and all I think about is how much I don’t want to see another year. Nothing is working anymore. Not the drugs.

I've been trying, I did things I'd never dream to do in a sane mind, I record and launched some songs, I tried to contact the girl I really loved for no avail, only to read the foulest shit about me...

I've left this for you because I want you to know how I felt, because I want you to know that it's neither of your faults, and because I want you to know that this, truly, is what I want.

As far as I can remember in my life I've been either nervous or miserable. That isn't a figure of speech, I truly mean that the earliest memories I have which I am able to string together, not merely flashes in the pan, are all tinged by a perpetual anxiety and a vague melancholy. 

These feelings initially intensified with age, peaking with my drunken breakdown in Christmas of 2018, and my weed induced breakdown of 2021. At this stage these feelings have become so normal, that I no longer find a reason to be alive.

This isn't based on any one circumstance, its not based on any one behaviour, its not based on any one thing one person did, either once or repeatedly. Maybe it's all of these things, maybe deep down it's none of them. I don't know, nor do I think I ever could know.

All I know is that my own head is an intolerable place to be, that even the most basic of actions I find to be almost completely intolerable. The concept of working for the rest of my life, finding and losing love, dedicating time toward fulfilling hobbies, raising children, all of these things I have no interest in. Deep down I suppose I want them, but the pain associated with building myself to this point and to sustaining this I just truly don't believe to be worth it.

I have no friends because I don't have the energy to stay friends with anyone, I don't have a routine because I am too lazy and lack the motivation to do so. My dreams are all based upon the image of completedness rather than any of the steps, because I have no interest in pursuing them. 

I'm just tired. More than anything, I'm just tired of being alive. I get no long lasting satisfaction from anything. Again, this isn't hyperbole, it's not an exaggeration, this is as close to the truth as I can get. You will notice that I never leave my room, and that's because all of this is true.

I love you both very much, and Nan, but this message isn't for her, as I am waiting for her to pass away before you ever end up needing to read this. I love you both to the very ends of the earth. You provided me with the only consistent and ever present source of love in my life, one that I sought repeatedly from friends and partners but never got.

I treasure this love with everything I have, and my only regret is the pain that I know you will inevitably feel. This letter I hope will provide the smallest crumb of comfort, and will serve as a source of some closure should you ever find the ability to reach that stage. I desperately hope you both do. You deserve so many good things together.

You shouldn't feel bad because I want to be dead, as I now am. I don't want to worry anymore, and I want to be free from pain. I wouldn't do this if it wasn't the right thing for me to do. I love you both very much.

I have diaries, they are on my bookshelf, not all of it is pleasant however you can read those and feel that I am telling you stories of my life because they were intended for me to feel that way whilst reading them. I have many voice recordings on my phone of me speaking, along with several videos of myself saved on my computer.

I love you both. Thank you for everything, and I am truly sorry. Take care,

M"

Certain things that I was saving for the future, like certain songs I wasn't ready to listen to, I'm slowly doing them all, at least, what I can. I wasn't ready to do something for the longest time and now I don't have that time, which is a huge regret, but one I'm willing to accept. It's... weird. I am finally doing these things I had saved for the future. It's nice to have that kind of finale, that patience is paying off. I always felt that dread when thinking of suicide, and now that I am facing it I realize just how manageable it is, especially with a life of planning behind you. I don't have long left, but I am thankful to my past self for setting things up so well, because my final moments are simply beautiful, and I am ready for what's about to come. Tomorrow is going to be wonderful. I've always been a good kid, and an important part about that is that I never got to face a day of actual freedom since I have never been truant or dishonest. I did the first truly bad thing in my life, I lied about my work schedule and now have 8 hours of freedom tomorrow, so I can enjoy myself before I go (and do a bit of preparation). I'm feeling ready to die. I'll have done what I wanted and died happy and true to myself. I'm a bit terrified of what that might sound like from an outside perspective, but it makes leaving so easy. I have little time left, and I am grateful that I've worked so well to make them as prosperous as possible. Or maybe I'm just being delusional to cope with the stress and pain of going through with such a thing."

I got sick recently and my first thought was how much money my family would have to fork over to keep me from dying when i really dont care. It's not like I'm even going through anything super traumatic or particularly hard. I just cant motivate myself to care. I know these thoughts are temporary and all that but of the two people I've told that I wanted to die I dont know how to tell them that they are part of why I want to. I hate hurting them. I hate making things harder for them. I hate that I cant fix the mistakes I make and be more useful. So yeah, I know I probably won't kill myself and I'll be back to the shut in artist who always has a smile on soon but I just needed to vent because I dont know how to tell the people I love I hate myself for not being worth loving."

Again, don't worry about me. I can assure you that I won't be killing myself soon.

But like I said, I feel like I would be happier if I did.

Basically, I was thinking of a certain reason why gf would break up with me, and thinking ""What would I do if she did that?"" I thought ""I could just kill myself"" and honestly it felt like an eureka moment. Like, it felt like an actual good idea.

It's not that if my gf leaves me I will kill myself because of her. More like, she the only reason why I'm really putting up with all this shit.

Listen, the reason why I said that you don't have to worry about me if you really want to help someone on here is because I am actually happy. I got good friends, a nice job, a caring family, and a gf that is the love of my life. 
My problem is that I feel like I'm losing friends bit by bit (already lost so many, but the ones I still have are the ones that matter, and I still feel like I could/am still losing them). I like my job but it pays so little that it is nowhere near enough to actually start a life with it. My family cares for me and I love them but they have so many problems that I have to get away from them asap. And my gf is means everything to me, so when she does something that makes me upset, it just hurts so deep... I wanted to spend newyears with her watching the fireworks but her parents don't want her out on new years hecause of the pandemic, even though we were together today with a group of friends. Ok but that wouldn't be a problem in any normal moment becuase I know what her family is like and I'm normally ok putting up with it. But now... I just really need her to bring some actual happiness in my life... 

Another reason why you don't have to worry much about me is that I can still make myself happy. I can look on the bright side of my life and be grateful for it, sincerely. I can, thankfully, make myself genuinely happy.
But my problem is I'm tired of it. Im tired of making myself happy. Im tired of needing to make the effort. I wish I could just be happy. 

If I kill myself, I won't have to keep on trying. And the idea of that just feels so... in lack of another word, I want to say peaceful... like, ""thank god I dont have to put up with that anymore"". Its like life is that annoying friendly neighbour that you want to be nice with, and is genuinely a nice person, but after a while you just can't stand them and you just want to kick them out. That's what life feels like for me. I can put up with it, and still enjoy it, but fucking hell how long do I have to put up with this shit? Because I don't think I will want to put up with it much longer now. I'll still hang on for now, but still... 

Thank you for reading all of this and once again god bless all of you on here trying to help anyone who needs it."

I have loved ones who are immunocompromised and I can’t stand the thought of hurting them. Now that I’m inside this, though, I sympathize heavily with those who don’t want to isolate for the full recommended period and with the CDC for shortening the isolation period for asymptomatic cases (even though that unfortunately wouldn’t apply to me).

after a few years of deliberating on the meaning of it all and some failed attempts of trying to die, i think ill hang myself in a few days or so. suicide is generally deemed as something irrational, but how come? ive been deliberating on it for years on end and i still always come back to the conclusion of wanting to end it all. have i just been irrational for years on end? if so, how would i know that im irrational? how would you or anyone would know that im irrational? 

theres a bit of guilt to it. im in no means in a bad environment nor am i in a good one either. perhaps my rather pessimistic perspective only sees the bad in the people around me. i tend to notice their hypocritical nature alongside mine. id like to talk about my feelings to them but im afraid, ive had bad experiences before

so, what is it. what is all the point of this? life is what you make of it, right? so what if ive made all that i needed to make and i just want to end it all? 

can someone talk me out of it? of course no ones obligated to, just wondering if someone could. input is always appreciated, thanks and have a good day"

Since you are reading this, I presume it has already happened. My reasons for doing this are the following: 

My various artistic pursuits are doomed. Over the years, I have practised art in terms of music and writing. At the start, I’ve no doubt I was very shitty. However, I do believe both my synth work and my recent novel are at least somewhat good, and so my inability to get them heard/read beyond a very small number of people has saddened me greatly. Regarding my writing, I do not see any hope of getting my recent novel published, and self-publishing will cause it to get buried. A consequence of this is that I don’t feel tempted to ever make anything creative again, as I’m confident they will suffer the same fate. Without being creative, I don’t feel any reason to live. While I do not relish portraying myself as a tortured artist, this is how I feel. 

My career in academia is doomed. My parents are currently paying a large amount for me to do a PhD, which is no doubt pointless. Even if I complete it, there would be no job for me. I have no support regarding the PhD. I certainly don’t blame my supervisor for that, because I have not written to him, and I’ve only met him once. But the fact is the university has not contacted me about the PhD once. While I have enjoyed tutoring, I’m doubtful my students find me a good teacher. 

Poor social life. Though I have developed several strong friendships over the years, my social life is still rather poor. I attribute this to two things: 1. My idiosyncratic interests and character. 2. My asexuality. 3. I moved countries as a teenager and had a few years where I was too autistic to socialise. Though occasionally I do meet someone I get along with, it is too few and far between to be significant. Thus I have always been isolated.  

The sense that I’ve tried to believe “it gets better” but it never does. In fact, I tried to kill myself earlier in 2020 and failed. Yet nothing much has improved. 

Well, that's all. I feel like it would be stupid of me to tell you how to react to my death. I think most people will move on quicker than they realise. Still, as I said, I’m sorry if I caused any pain."

My cousin loves me to death and she’s the only person I can truly say I love. We’ve just always bonded in a special way. Most people I’d rather not be around, but my mom and my cousin I could be around all day and it would be better than loneliness. I can’t say the same for anyone else

I wanna kill myself but I don’t want my parents or cousin to get that call. I wish I could send all my money to my cousin because I know she’d get great use out of it. She’s a free spirit that is loving, so happy and, would absolutely benefit/use it the way I wish I could. She goes on trips with her friends, has a great boyfriend, is ambitious, and excels in school and is set to graduate soon and become an engineer. She honestly lives the life I wish I could have.

I’ve been in a rut for years. I quit drugs for probably 7 months, give or take a month or two. I have every opportunity to have a “good life”, but idk what that entails for me. I don’t think I’ll ever be happy. Probably fried my brain with all the drugs. I’ve been suicidal for 3-4 years now and I’m just at my wits end. Maybe I just need to wait and everything will pan out but I really don’t care to. Nothing brings me happiness. 

I sold my gun a month ago and honestly am thinking about getting a new one, but I want to give my family an open casket funeral. Anything other than a headshot would be pretty painful I’d assume. I can get enough drugs to od but idk. Seems like a risk compared to a headshot. 

I’d probably give my motorcycle to my brother. He’d definitely love it. Well anyways idk if I can wait out my parents dying to do it, but I figure their pain after my suicide will heal. I don’t think My pain ever will.

The pathetic part is I come from a middle upper class family and really don’t have a lot to be ungrateful about. I just don’t enjoy living. I’ve tried therapy three times. 

Anyways, not sure why I posted. I’ve had 6 figures saved. I’m not financially troubled. I was in addiction but now I’m well off again. I am great and socializing with people but I never feel a connection with anyone. But I’ll stop rambling. Same story different tortured soul. Just thought I’d scream into the void of Reddit."

I constantly think about suicide, and ways of killing myself because there's no one there to talk to, to distract me at least. Someone to really engage with in my personal life who cares about me. I see people all the time in interviews, in passing, mentioning what keeps them going and it's always their family and friends. I have tried to no end to start building a family, to make friends. No one wants anything to do with me. I wouldn't want anything to do with me either. I'm pathetic and broken.

Whenever people do interact with me, they talk at me not to me. They don't care to get to know me, they just want to use me as a free therapist or a free ego boost. When they discover how poor my mental health is, how shit my life is, they distance themselves from me. Even if I hide that part of myself from them, I'm still not good enough. I'm tired of being alive and living at this point. I hate myself more than anything.

I remember reading an article about a pharmacist I believe who killed herself after her parents passed away and I could relate so much to her story. I'll link it if I find it, I just wanted to give her a hug. The loneliness she went through, the stress of growing old, the fact that no one really knew her (because it seemed no one cared to) and that her parents seemed to be her only friends. It was like looking in the mirror, she I think was in her 40s, so it was like looking into the not too distant future. Getting a job, still living at home to care for my mother's deteriorating health. Slipping in and out of each day miserable. Suicide really is the only solution for me."

I'm so tired of living in a world where I'm not wanted or liked. I'm so exhausted. I'm a burden, I'm a disappointment, I'm lazy. Most of all, no one loves or wants me. My mom says she does but i know she doesn't. My brother could care less whether I lived or died, he makes that obvious every day. The stranger living in my house doesn't like me and thinks I'm annoying lmao. I can't hold a job, I can't do normal human things without getting nauseous and sick. I'm not disabled enough for ssi or disability. Everyday is a fucking battle just to hold onto sanity. I just want to end it all. End the suffering, the pain. I'll never get married because im ugly and fat and have the personality of a fucking rock. I have no friends, except one but he has others. He doesn't need me. No one does. I'm utterly fucking worthless. I don't deserve to live on this planet  but mist of all I'm too fucking scared to kill myself. I don't want to live but I don't want to kill myself. I just want instant death via car crash or something. I don't care if it's painful for a moment, I just want to be dead. I already know that if I died, maybe people would be sad but they'd get over it quick. I'm not worth being sad over anyway. I have no talents, I can't do anything, I'm mean, I'm unlovable, I'm worthless so I can't help anyone or get a job. I'm constantly sick. I have no reason to live anymore. I don't have hope for college, I'm a high school drop out. Yeah, I dripped out of high school because I was bullied constantly and stalked. Basically, I'm just a living, breathing pile of shit. I have no use, I'm not even pretty to look at. I just want to float in an endless void, feeling nothing. I just want to be disappear, cease to exist. Maybe I'll finally get the courage to end it soon. Hopefully."

I graduated high school in June of 2021.
Self loathing has been a part of my life since early childhood, but now that I'm an adult, and seeing the real world, I've got, at least from the way I feel, more reason than ever to give up.

I want a place of my own to comfortably live in. A good job to pay for it. There was a point in my life when, in the future, I dreamed of becoming a father.

My self image issues are at least something I can feasibly get help for. But what can I do about this? Rent costs more than ever. A car costs more than ever. WATER costs more than ever. And I can't even hug my friends, because that puts everybody at risk of catching a disease that mutates into something new every other week.

Lately I've been watching and reading about Metaverse, and the evolution of VR technology. And while I find Mark Zuckerberg to be a sociopath given too much power, I feel that the people in the comments are just as delusional.

""The real world is beautiful, we should live in it instead of escaping into a fake one.""

What beauty? The sunset? The lake? The animals? What does it matter if you have no home? No money? No other human beings to see them with? People act like money is superficial. It should be, and it would be if we didn't structure our entire way of living around it.

This pandemic took the latter half of my high school years away. Prom. Graduation. Parties.

And now, this economy is taking my adult years away. A home. A car. A family.

I managed to get a job serving burgers, but what does that count for when the money I make can't even come close to giving me a life of my own? My mom insists that it's okay for me to live with her and pay a bit of rent until things get better, and I'm grateful, and I love her. But I don't want this. I don't want to have to leech off of my mother to survive. I want to be the man I dreamed of being since I was a kid. But as the days go by, and the prices get higher, the question echoes louder in my head. ""Why bother?""

I'm so fortunate to have what I have. A mom who loves me. A girlfriend who inspires me. Friends who I miss having the privillege of hugging. But what does it all count for if I can't contribute something of my own? Be my own man?

As a child, your existence contributes nothing to society. Possibly even negatively given the resources it takes to raise a child. And that's okay. Children shouldn't work jobs or pay rent. That's how I rationalized it as a child. And I'd tell myself that I'd make up for it once I became a man. But I don't feel like a man. And I don't feel like I'll ever be one."

My parents would be sad for maybe a week but then be happy being an only child no more extra spending on me. I have a bad habit of always losing friends. Why do men like me exist?

The volunteer work I've been doing in some non-profit originations have almost no impact on people and I've just been feeling extremely useless to everyone I know for a while now.

A lot of people have helped me over the years with things like employment and food, and I am a very  privileged  person with a lot of resources (I can't afford therapy though) but I am extremely obsolete to them.

I have not been diagnosed with anything but I have come to realize over the years that I am a very slow person- in the sense that I think, act and decide things much slower than everyone else. I feel like I am retarded and I can't improve no matter how hard I try. Or maybe I'm not trying hard enough.

And the worst part is that sometimes I am rude without even knowing it. I have trouble understanding or relating to people almost all the time, especially people within my age group. And sometimes I'm just rude to my own family members because I want to be, and no matter how many times I regret things I say afterwards I never seem to learn.

Point is, I don't know what I am doing wrong but I know that I don't really matter to anyone and I can't help the people I want to help, whenever it is a personal friend, family member or struggling peer.

And I don't know if I actually do want to help them or whenever I just want to help them for my own selfish self-actualization.

If anyone could give some advice, I would love it. I could really use some, thanks."

Had my first, and to this point only suicide attempt in spring 2019.

Things remained rough until I met this girl in late 2019, I still had depressive episodes fairly often but they weren't as severe as before.

The girl quickly became my best friend I've ever had, we have the same personality and share the same interests and quirks.

Lately I noticed a change in our both behavior, we flirted when we talked, cuddled when we watched movies, hold hands etc. 

The one and only problem with this girl was that she lives really far away from me, still when we saw each other in person it was easily the best time of the year for me.
We even talked about how we wanted to move in together in the future.

I was really really happy and motivated to push through everything that was getting in my way. Depressive thoughts, self consciousness, the sometimes 14 hour long workdays, everything was okay because I kept thinking: it's all for her. 

Since I was free from work over the holidays it was a no-brainer for me to visit her, and as always it was great. 

Since things looked so good for us i finally asked her out, sadly she didn't receive it well at all. 

To keep it short: she said she only ever saw me as a friend and now needs some distance. 

I'm really devastated, i really thought I would have a chance being with her. 

So now, i not only lost my best friend in the world, but also the hope of a happy future and my motivation to keep going. 

I really really don't know what to do now. I just want the pain and the frustration to end. 



TL;DR: been depressed since late 2018, had girl easy the pain, just to lose her and the motivation to keep going in the end"

I've been planning to do it in the beginning of the year for a couple months. But of course as always not that it's really close I have some doubts I guess.

Thing is I feel like I want to do it so much. Not even cause of that much sadness or whatever. But I just feel like I have to and need to and want to. And I can't stop that. And I genuinely think if I did it (and survived obviously) I would feel so much better. Like I won't have that craving anymore cause I would have done it. And if I die well I die.

It's just so mentally taxing and idk how much longer I can actually take it. There's so much I don't want to do too so it just seems like the best option.

AMD it feels like I'm faking it cause I've almost done it once before but I didn't. And if I don't do it now then I'm just looking for attention

Idk. Idk why I'm really writing this rn. I just wanted to get this off my chest a bit I guess. Feeling the feeling now too.

When you tried to leave over and over they wouldn’t let you. But then they met those people or person and left you with no hesitation. Now you’re digging deep to find a purpose in life. Motivation to keep going. Knowing that no one could fill the void but that said person. I should’ve left when I had the strength. But when I was at my lowest point you leave me for the sharks. I love you. Fuck you. I hope they disown you from their friend group. And when I die, you recollect the times we had. The times when you knew I needed you. The times when I cried for help over and over but to no avail. One can only cry so long ‘fore they turn cold hearted. But my conscience won’t let me. My conscience won’t let me say fuck everyone and fuck the world. Because deep down all I wanted was for this to work out. For you to have faith in my change of character. But you didn’t. And now suicide seems more appealing than ever before. Ive been through MANY dark times ALONE and they made me stronger. Then I fall in love, depend solely on one person for love, support, comfort, and now I can’t even cope. I’m in incredible grief.  I’ve exhausted all my resources. Death doesn’t scare me anymore. Thinking about it enrages me. Gets my adrenaline pumping to the point I can blow my brains out with no regards for my family. No suicide note. No explanation. But I can’t be that big of a dick. Tired of living off listening post Malone, xxx,  and smoking weed. My only two motivations. Why’d you leave me so damaged? I know your friends are putting poison in your ear about me. And you’re agreeing. Don’t miss me when I’m gone. Don’t regret not answering my multiple cries for help through text. Don’t think about the past. Think about the present and future. You know, the one you don’t want with me after 3 years of unconditional love. I tried to find someone to distract me from you. And it didn’t work. It made me realize sex is useless to me. I want YOU I don’t want sex. None of them are you. None of them will ever be you. But it took the mistake of finding out. You cut too deep now you left me scarred. I’m done suffering.

I always had in mind there must be a way to assess the long term possibility that a person might become suicidal (maybe it exists).

What I mean is to assess the person when life is going well, I think there could be a way to assess suicidal risk in the long term. I know suicide is a combination of events culminating to suicide, but as an example my best friend in high school committed suicide. Before the immediate signs of taking is own life (stopped eating, etc), his lifestyle and personality could have been evaluated. After the fact I told myself: he’s always had a very small social network, getting a girlfriend was an obsession, social acceptance was very important to him, he didn’t have many hobbies or interest outside chatting on internet (talking about the mid 90s with basic chat softwares). He got a girlfriend online that left him a month or 2 after, and that triggered a sequence of events that led to his suicide. His entire world crumbled, a combination of his personality traits and outside factors could have provided an insight of becoming at risk someday.

Is it possible that with a psychological test, we would have been able to say: he is at risk of having a devastating event happen to him that could lead to becoming suicidal?

Just wondering what people think about this. I used my friend as an example, it’s been over 20 years so the guilt phase and stuff is behind me. Just wondering if it was attempted by science to assess long term suicide risk based on personality and outside factors."

Earlier this year I wanted to jump in front of the bus and I checked myself into a hospital. I was so depressed I couldn’t function and I could barely even stand up just cry, but I still wanted to go to the hospital so I’d stay safe. 

Since then my meds have been back to stable, I have a high paying job I enjoy with great coworkers who respect and value my input, I don’t have to go into an office, I have no debt or financial stress/insecurity, My family relationships are decent, I recently made things official with the guy I’ve been talking to long distance for the last three years, I own a home I love in a city I love, I have close friends and get to spend a lot of time with my best friend of almost 30 years and her perfect little girl…and yet every single day I literally say ‘I want to die’ ‘I wish I was did’ or ‘I don’t want to exist’ out loud as if it’s Tourette’s. Like I don’t know it’s about to come out of my mouth until I’ve already said it. 

It’s also kind of an intrusive thought throughout the day. Like I don’t feel like cooking dinner - I wish I was dead so I didn’t have to eat. Or  instead of thinking I don’t feel like waking up early for work tomorrow I wish I was dead so I didn’t have to work. And I really like my job! And even with good things like if I’m going on a big vacation somewhere cool with people I like.I’d rather be dead than expend the energy to travel. And I love to travel. 

But it’s not like I think ‘I’d rather kill myself’ just that I’d rather not exist. Like no effort (positive or negative) is worth the amount of energy it takes. And when I am with friends or out I do have a good time but there’s still that thought of I’d rather not exist than stand up to be here. 

I never want to go to sleep because I don’t want to wake up. I never feel excited to wake up in the morning. It’s not that I’m dreading the day or things I have to do, I really do like my job, I just don’t want to do it. But instead of thinking I wish I didn’t have to work to live, I wish I didn’t exist so I didn’t need to work. 

I realized last night it’s time to talk to my psychiatrist about it again but I just don’t understand why this feeling never goes away"

I sleep till 12pm in the afternoon, and they start banging my door, hoping for me to wake up and play with them. They never get tired. They always take my hand, pull me out of the bed to play with them. They are SOOOO STRONG. They can literally pull out of the bed. They hide behind the curtains, because they know I'll look for them. If I die, they'll be waiting for me to peek-a-boo/find them, but they'll never know what happened to me, since they are little. This is what keeps me going. They love me. They even offer me their food. They use their little fingers to feed me cake. 

My boyfriend is amazing. I love him, and his company. I wish he knew his own worth, but I hope he sees his worth one day. We barely get to talk, because of his busy schedule, and he lives 10000kms away from me - he went there for higher studies. I wish I could explain in words, what he means to me.

But still I want to die. I am too lazy to kill myself, but thinking about them is what stops me. They would be sad. My sadness will be passed to them. Life will be meaningless, and yeah, I do sound like I think I'm an important person, but I'm an important person in their lives, I guess? I just want to be there for them. Always. And forever.

I finished a PhD in chemistry (and did really well in my area) and got a national lab postdoc with very reasonable hours (actually not a good thing because I can only work 9-5, 3-4 days a week due to covid rules, so much less time for research so that magnifies mistakes), and significantly better pay than most academic postdocs.

The area I'm in right now is a LOT more different from what I did in grad school than I expected. I thought the transition would be less difficult, but it wasn't. I was put on a couple of projects that are the most tedious, boring, and aggravating I've ever attempted, but instead of just paying my dues and throwing myself into them and the new techniques I'm using to analyze the data, I procrastinated in learning them but kept collecting data. Now I'm sitting on a mountain of data that I don't know how to analyze, I'm finding holes in it, things I'm going to have to spend another month or so filling in, and I'm nearing the end of my first year. My boss is losing patience with me and I feel like the worst postdoc he's ever had, but I know I have the capacity to succeed. I doubt he's going to renew my contract, which I'm predicting means that I will NEVER be able to get a job in academia or industry ever again if I can't get a good letter from my postdoc advisor.

This was the greatest opportunity of my life and I threw it away because instead of facing my fears and dealing with my feelings of burnout, I let things pile up to the point of being nearly insurmountable. I feel humiliated, I feel like my group hates me, and I feel like they will never respect me again. I hate the groups research and I want out, but that's irrelevant.

The reason I'm suicidal is that the PhD is the only thing I've accomplished in life, I have no relationships, no memories of parties, social milestones, etc. If I don't get my contract renewed then I feel like it all would have been for nothing. All it would have taken to avoid this situation is to have spent time each day focusing on learning the things that seemed big and horrible, and to have brought my problems to my advisor for help months ago, and I would have been just fine.

Suicide seems Ike the PERFECT solution to these fucking projects, and to attone for a type of failure for which I in particular have absolutely NO excuse, and that seems like a problem. I don't want to do it, but I see no way to attone for this inexcusable humiliation I've done to myself.

Has anybody experienced similar feelings in similar situations? Thank you for reading this pile of flaming spaghetti!"

I recently came across this subreddit and thought I'd share some of my recent experiences and past events that I believe have shaped my life into where its at today. I don't have any clinical depression, anxiety nor mental illness. At least I've never been to the doctor and had them tell me so. 

However due to a few things including the loss of my job, lack of money, hard time of year and an all round lack of identity, purpose and goals in life. I know it seems simple enough, get a job and things will sort themselves out. I have been trying to get a job and the things that do land end up making me more miserable or I simply stop turning up. It is a terrible trait that I've unfortunately acquired and I really am not sure how to turn it all around.

Never have I attempted to take my own life. I feel if I was truly capable perhaps I wouldn't be sat here writing this message out. However, some days it does feel like the only option. When you cannot see a way out, there is always the one clear, direct way out that nobody can have any say about.  

 Sorry for rambling on, I just wondered if any of you guys have had the same experiences in life, what's helped you and how you're doing these days. 

Thanks in advance, hope everyone is well."

rr7gm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rr7gm1/tell_me_what_can_go_wrong/,Tell me what can go wrong,3,4,1640782142.0,"I know you are not allowed to tell me how to do that or even say it's ok to want to die, so tell me what can go wrong with my plan. Let's assume it can help me reconsider and choose... not to do it at all. To be safe in here. 

My plan is to take my sleeping and anxiety medicine I have collected, asking for more and more. First to take the usual dose. When I start to get a bit sleepy, take some more, about 5x. When I get very sleepy, take half of everything I have, and that's LOT. Wait a bit for it to at least dissolve, I don't know, about 3 minutes, and then take some alcohol. I am planning not to take everything in case I start to vomit very soon. Then I take the other half and wait as long as I can, and then take some alcohol. 

I plan to do this near the river, at the very coast, so if I pass out, I would fall into water. The thing is - I am a coward. I would not be able to jump into river with some stones attached. I would want to shoot myself, but I don't have a gun. I am afraid to hang myself, because I don't want to suffocate, and I am not sure can I do it right to brake my neck. So, I figured to take all my psycho drugs, about 70 pills, 11 different kind, and make myself either pass out and die, or fall into water, and I hope I would be a bit more numb and it would be a bit easier in that state, or I would not even wake, like some people in the bath.

Or maybe I should start with some alcohol, not to vomit the medicine out. Those drugs are ""bad"" with alcohol, so just the thing I need. I also intend to take a knife with me, in case it gets very bad to the point I can force myself to cut my wrists. I think if I start to feel too much pain, I could maybe drown myself or cut myself more easily, because I just can't do it. I have sat near the river with a backpack full of stones, tight to my waist, I have stood on a high building, I have sat in the bath with a razor, and I just can't. 

I am afraid do fail and be disabled to the point when I am in pain but no longer capable of killing myself. I am so incredibly afraid of it I just freeze and stop. Also I am just afraid of long pain. I am self harming, but I burn not to see blood. Never burned seriously to need medical attention. 

I am a complete looser, I am afraid to do something wrong, so assume you are trying to talk me out of it and tell me what can go wrong with my plan. 

Maybe I will start to vomit when I am too sick to cut myself or maybe being drugged possibly mortally I would still feel a lot of suffering if jump or fall into a river? Or is it safe to assume if I take it gradually if may work as planned and I pass out right in time?"

Im in this limbo where i really want to kill myself but I don’t have a method that I’m comfortable going thru with yet. Im actively searching for ways I can kill myself because I’m unable to cope with my emotions. They get so intense 99% of the time that I start clawing at my skin and having strong urges to cut of bang my head against the wall because Im crawling out of my skin all the time. I just feel super uncomfortable. I haven’t felt any sort of pleasure in the past 8 months. I can’t keep going on like this. On top of that I have really bad insomnia so I can’t just sleep away everyday. I fucking hate my parents and friends because they are the only things holding me back rn from killing my self but at this point I resent them so fucking much because I feel like I’m torturing myself purely so they don’t get hurt. It’s unfair. Like why do I owe them to keep myself alive? I feel so shameful because I know I can’t deal with this pain anymore but I can’t Kms without hurting them. Like they just need to accept that I can’t go on like this anymore. Whenever I’m around my mom all I think about is how much pain it’s gonna cause her to see me in my coffin. I feel so alone no one around me truly understands the pain I’m going thru. I can’t keep wearing this mask anymore. I have a bottle of Xanax I just need to find some alc and I’ll be good. Having a way out is the only thing that brings me some peace that this will be over soon. Hope when I do it my body isn’t found. Ive become a slave to my fucked up mind and I can’t fight it anymore. Wish there was a way I could do it without hurtin anyone. Also it’s so hard for me to put how I feel into words when I talk to someone which fucking pisses me off because I feel like no one will ever get it or believe that I’m in a lot of pain which makes me resent people even more. Hope something changes soon because I don’t think I’m gonna be on this planet next month I can only sit through this for so much longer.

rr6sde,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rr6sde/unique_situation/,Unique situation,4,0,1640779845.0,"So I had a relatively normal life by most people standards before 2020. Great friends, a good social life, physically and mentally healthy, stable job and a degree from a well regarded university. But unfortunately for me, during 2020 I had a psychotic episode of unknown cause (it wasn't drug induced or anything of that nature).
I have since received treatment and made a full recovery (I no longer have any psychotic symptoms) but unfortunately in the midst of my episode I consumed a very large amount salt because I was completely delusional and for some strange reason that I cannot really explain, I thought that I would die if I stopped eating salt... 

So now, I am 99.9% certain that I have caused myself irreversible brain damage because of the high salt intake. I have not been able to work because of the extreme mental fatigue associated with my condition and going to social events wears me down to the point we're I need to sleep for a few days straight to recover. Also, mundane tasks like unloading the dishwasher and  brushing my teeth are very taxing for me to the point were I need to rest afterwards. It's almost impossible to get by day to day because all of my friends invite me out frequently and I am honestly to embarrassed/ashamed to tell them about my situation so I just struggle through in silence.
The weird thing is, I'm not even depressed, in fact I'd say my mood is good. But the grind of getting through each day is extremely exhausting and the thought of having to do it for potentially 60-70 more years is beyong terrifying. 
Oh, and you know how I said my life was normal? It was, except for one major fact that I'm reaching my late 20s and ive never had a girlfriend. And now since I can barely do anything without crashing for days, I feel like I've lost all hope of having that sort of connection with someone. And that thought is soul destroying for me. I can't really put into words how debilitating that thought is for me. And I can't escape it. To be honest it's all I really want from life. I will never be intimate with someone I love and I'll never be able to raise a family and travel and do all the awesome things life has to offer. I almost feel like this is some big joke, it just doesn't feel real at all. Like what the actual fuck, my life was set to be so awesome and I have just completely cooked the whole thing in literally one night...
I can't live like this, I just want it to be over."

I'm posting it again because I still need help and I don't know who else to talk to. I think what I wrote here is a pretty good expression of myself and I wouldn't want to bother the people on TrueOffMyChest with my life one more time.) 

This year has been really awful; University went to shit and I dropped out, I'm still not over my ex-girlfriend/friend's suicide last year, I almost tried killing myself a few months ago, my girlfriend of 2.5 years left me for another guy and gaslighted me for 2 months until 3 days ago, my friends aren't in the country and I just went on something I thought was a date with an old flame who I've always had a thing for but turns out he didn't see this as that at all and has no feelings for me whatsoever despite us flirting back and fourth for the last few days.

Sometimes I feel like I should've killed myself years ago and just living feels like when you get home and you haven't done your homework. You know that something is off and a little voice in your head says ''Hey come on, just do this thing you know you should do.''

Sometimes I kind of wish I had killed myself, either years ago when I was feeling awful as well or a few months ago.

A good friend has helped me through a lot of this year because he has also been having it really rough and we've been there for each other. And he really is amazing! But of course he can't be there always because his life is also a mess, and I can't be there for him always either.  
The one person I felt like I could always talk to was my girlfriend and now that I found out she lied to me and treated me like dirt I don't know who I can talk to, I don't know who I can trust anymore.

I just feel really lonely and I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I just don't want to be alone because I'm scared."

Recently I've been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. (D.i.d) and severe depression. I've been struggling for a long time but this is the first time I've gotten you know, a doctor's note for it ig. Pretty much my mental is complete shit. I have no clue what to do, my mental and physical health is horrible. I wake up, and its the same pain over and over again."

(Mentions self harm and sexual trauma),5,3,1640767686.0,"     I just dont understand what the point of life is anymore. Sorry this will probably be long but I need to do something. I'm an 18yo Female who has suffered from ADHD, anxiety, and depression since I was 12. I have been sexual assaulted on multiple occasions since I was 8. I have been broken for quite some time. 
     I went to therapy at 15 after 3 attempts to take my life, one that was hospitalized and two that I chickened out of. I left therapy at 16 thinking I had been ""Cured"". I was feeling great, made new friends, ate well, and felt good about who I was. After quarantine, I knew I was numb but didn't realize how badly I was struggling because my depression didn't feel the same as last time.      
      I graduated, got accepted to a great college, and just spent my first semester there. I left home feeling like my life was starting. And now I'm home trying to find a reason to live. I had a terrible trigger event for my sexual trauma the first month of school this year and ever since that event I cant stand my body. And I don't want to share a space with my mind anymore. I wish I could rip my soul away from this body and this mind and transplant it into someone new. Two weeks after the trigger event I self harmed for the first time in 2 years. And within 2 months, my year of work in therapy was gone and I was very suicidal again. 
     Now I'm home for winter break. I failed half my classes, I'm broke, my family is falling apart, and one of my best friends is in a suicide recovery center. My life really isn't terrible. I can logically see the good in life every day. I understand that life is precious and that life is important and I don't WANT to die. But my brain shows me picture of the medications in the house and the location of my families firearms and reminds me how easy it would be if I just ended my existence. I want to fight it for my boyfriends sake and for my siblings sake, but I feel myself slipping uncontrollably towards harming myself. The thoughts are a parasite latching onto my thoughts, begging me to harm myself.
     Tonight I have a plan in place that should remove me from this world within the next week. I'm scared but maybe its for the best.


Long Story Short: College student with a history of sexual trauma is suicidal with a plan in place. Hoping for help."

He was rarely ever home after our daughter got home, (I nearly died having her she was born at 25 weeks and only weighed a pound due to pre-eclampsia) he would be out sometimes 10 hours a night. This is a man who i begged to take me out for nearly 4 years and he told me he isn't like that so he won't do it but does it for other woman.

When i met him he didn't have a life, no ID, need surguries, neglected off his mum, etc. I fixed that all for him, i bought him ID, clothes, playstation, got him his hospital appointments to get him fixed, registered him with a dentist, i bought all his family christmas presents, birthday presnts i handled everything for him. 

He knew of my past truamas with my first boyfriend beating me badly and after that my friend raping me multiply times, he knew all this and still left me to deal with everything emotional myself when i tried so hard to fix him and his family. 

But how cruel he is being to me the now is really pushing me over the edge, police are invloved for him attacking me and all of this has to go to court i don't think i can handle this.

I feel as if if I tell my parents they’ll be disappointed in themselves. For raising a depressed kid even tho it’s not their fault. When they found my first suicide note, they told me it was selfish and made me feel horrible. I didn’t feel as if I got help but instead got insults thrown at me. I didn’t want to be here and I don’t. It wasn’t my choice to be brought in this world but it could be my choice to remove me from this world. I’d feel bad becuase my best friend is the one person I love and she is the best (sister) from another family I could ever have. But I still feeel empty.

I've intermittently been in and out of outpatient care since I was in my early teens but I've never really had any long-term consistent support. I come from a poor background and where I live it's practically impossible to get and meaningful care unless you are at an absolute extreme and have been there for a while.

Despite this, I've really tried my best to try and educate myself and do what I can to 'empower' myself to be able to live a better life. I've bought textbooks, watched lectures, done my own research and tried to implement it in my life but I still struggle so hard with the same issues. In the past year I've realised that I probably have a disability that would explain a lot of the struggles I've faced but I am on a year-long waiting list to even get an assessment and in the meanwhile what little of a life I have has been crumbling before my eyes.

One of my friends died under terrible circumstances and I have no way to cope with this anymore. I have so much sadness and regret. The last message my friend sent me was them begging to see me since it'd been so long and I never got around to responding and now I never will be able to. Without going into too much detail, the manner of their death meant that for weeks we didn't even know if they were dead or alive and almost all the information has come from 3rd party sources. Their body was kept by the coroner for weeks and then the funeral happened suddenly the next day. It has been so hard to process all of this.

I just feel so massively alone. I know that I have people that care about me and the only reason I am here typing this out rn is because of them but I am so so tired of everything. I'm terrified of leaving the house, after what happened to my friend I completely stopped going out anywhere. I can barely even leave my room without having a panic attack. My family aren't the worst but they have never really known what to do with me and I get the sense that my presence often just makes them feel sad or worried. My brother called me on Christmas day and said he'd spoken with my mother a few days ago and she was crying and saying that she felt like she was going to lose me. After  I ended the call with him I broke down because I know she saw how terribly far I have gone.

I've tried to get some medical help but the state of the healthcare system is absolute chaos rn and it just feels impossible. Getting mental health support has always been a struggle but throw in a global pandemic into the mix and its nigh impossible to get access to any kind of care and I can't afford to go private.  I've even reached out for crisis berevement therapy and they couldn't help since they could only offer support for people if the loved one had died x weeks ago and my friend's passing didn't fall in that range.

I feel like I have really tried my best with everything. I am so tired. I just cry all of the time. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I feel like I physically want to be sick constantly. My thoughts have turned so dark about everything, all I can think about are the ways that everyone will be better off without having to deal with me and how I would be better off not having to live like this anymore. I've barely left my bed in the past week, I spent christmas by myself sleeping. I'm supposed to go back into work next week and I feel sick when I think about it. I can't even remember how to 'perform' myself anymore, I don't feel like a real person anymore.

I'm not actively looking to die but I know that the moment will come when I get to the point when I will. I feel so scared and sad. I wish I had more options but I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to hurt the people that care about me but I physically can't keep forcing myself to live like this just for them. I just don't know what to do anymore."

It feels wrong sharing it to people who knew me because I am not sure of the aftermath if I can handle it,  once they knew. I wonder how they will look me now or if they will dismiss it.

Why does it feel much easier on telling here this? I am 20 and I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for almost a decade or so. I couldn't remember the exact age I was when it started, probably 3rd grade or 4th grade. I just have a distant memory of me crying myself to sleep and hoping that I'll die. ""I want to disappear"" and then I remember myself imagining that the wall I am leaning into to collapse. Looking back,  I haven't realized the weight of my thoughts. I didn't know why it was my initial thought then, I still couldn't remember the root cause of it (I'm trying to remember but my mind wouldn't let me). I ignored ALL of it. I realized that it was easy to ignore things you weren't aware of or at least something you couldn't understand yourself and no one to ask to. So I keep ignoring it and luckily, it went away so I thought. 

It came back when I was in 7th grade. It went away for a year when I transferred houses. When I was in 7th grade I sensed that what I'm feeling is odd that it felt wrong that I shouldn't be feeling that, I ignored it once more. 2016 came I was in 8th grade, I finally had the courage to admit it to MYSELF that I'm not okay. I was all over the place but somehow I managed to seperate it from my studies. I got high grades and continue on doing so. 

I was in grade 9 I made a decision that I need to tell someone. I told my uncle. I am so nervous I don't know how I got the courage despite of me predicting the result. I told him that I want to die. He told me ""that's wrong"" that I shouldn't feel that; told me that I should be more positive 
(lol as if I didn't told that myself) after I told him that I had a false relief and the suicide thoughts ""stopped"" only to return after a few weeks. I've been feeling this way since then, it got worse as time goes by. 

I tried self harming in 9th grade just to know how it feels and I am so pissed of at that time coincidentally, I am holding a blade so I just went on it. I didn't tried it it after a year. Now, it got worse. I feel like a ticking time bomb walking on thin ice."

But this isn't the reason that I want to die now, I still had fight in me, so what if I'm unemployed, live with my mom, have no gf or my own family, idgaf, I was happy, as long as I could do the things that I love I was fine, as long as I had me I could go on.

But what do you know, last year I was doing pretty fine until I had a fucking stroke, yeah, being sick for over a decade wasn't enough, life had to take a shit on me and shove it down my throat, now I'm paralyzed on the right side of my body, I'm fucking crippled, I can't do the things I love anymore, and I'm still chronically ill, trapped in this useless body that is slowly getting worse.

If I were a dog, they would have put me down by now out of pity and love.

Basically now I live with one hand and half working fingers, and walk really slow and limping.

I hate that the medical profession won't grant me a dignifying death, that my family keep telling me to fight this stupid battle for who knows how long, but don't provide any support, and I hate that I'm sucking the last years out of my mom's life but that if I kill myself I will also hurt her for the rest of those years.

I have some pills ready for when I feel that is the time to end it, but I wish they could just let me go, that they could grant me a peaceful death without the risk of a failed suicide attempt.

Keeping people like myself alive is cruelty, specially when they just do it because they don't want me dead, but at the same time do nothing to improve my quality of life, or help me find what little joy in life is left, I'm alone.

It doesn't matter, I'll kill myself when the time comes."

I live in a country that is very tolerant of LGBT+. But my mom said a few homophobic phrases when I was younger about how gay people are disgusting perverts and stuff like that.

I've had some form of depression or another for at least 14 years. I've been to therapy and have learned a lot about psychology which both have helped me develop insight into my situation and ways to manage it.

Despite this, I've been getting suicidal thoughts several times a week (if not daily) for something like a couple years at least, with perhaps a period here or there in which it is less frequent. They're not usually long but still come up. A common way for me to deal with it is to distract myself with YouTube, podcasts, Reddit, Facebook, or whatever. When things get quiet at night (like now) it is usually the worst. Distraction turns into procrastinating sleep which turns into not getting nearly enough sleep which contributes to the depression, irritability, and suicidal thoughts.

I just keep thinking things like how I'm not for this life, that I'm missing basic skills, that most ""friends"" don't really care that much, and that I'm a burden to my wife and kids. I get sad when I hear things like how my son would ask for me when I'm not home because I picture that in the context of if I kill myself. I put it off enough so that at least my oldest is old enough to remember me for some time if I do die.

I don't intend to kill myself but I'm so tired of dealing with these thoughts.. I'm tired of feeling this way. Sometimes it feels like it's just something that is going to happen someday, but I don't want to and don't intend to. It's tiring having to catch the cognitive distortions supporting them and catching them when they pop up. I don't want to let them run free in my mind otherwise, though, because when I have it's like I fantasize about it and how better off people would be despite that probably not being accurate (if I think clearly about it). 

I have flirted with going back to therapy but I'm skeptical that there is much more to learn and don't have a lot of funds or time for it.

I don't mean to complain but figured I'd try this as an outlet since I don't talk with anyone about having suicidal thoughts for fear of making people worry or uncomfortable."

So a simplified backstory: we actually met when she responded to a post that I made on here, and as our relationship got serious we basically made a pact that if she died first I’d follow her and she’d do the same for me.

So I’m only living to keep her alive and happy. She’s the most amazing person I’ve ever met and I just want to do whatever it takes to keep her happy and free from suffering. But now I’m reconsidering… She’s told me that I’m her only reason to live as well, and it might just be selfish to force her to stay around and live in misery. She may find someone who can actually make her happy and help her to get better and that is the best outcome, but even if she follows me into death at least she won’t suffer anymore. Either way, my death is the best way to ease her pain.

I’m sorry for posting multiple things on the sub within such a short time span. I guess I need a suicide note now more than ever, if you saw that last post that I made.

I’m not sure what to even say, right now. I don’t want to say anything, but eh, to fill that void in my heart that nothing really can.

I just watch everything fall into nothingness. I’ve lost so much that I’m  just done. My husband is a single man, now, though. Newly single. If anyone has a friend or needs a man, he’s newly single.


I’ve written the suicide note on my phone. I’ve got no money; I’m n supposed to be a mother next year, and I just can’t do it. Another human being that has me as a parent. I’m disgusted and disappointed in myself, really. I’m not capable of raising another human. I’m not worth being a mother. Don’t even say that this is all normal. Don’t even say that  I’m just another human because I’m not.


I just want this to end. I’ve seen why my ‘friends’ do stuff without me. I’m not their friend, I never was. Just take me away. He’s trying to make me laugh. He knows. He can sense my emotions and it suuuuuuuuucks.


I’ve been told so many times that I’m a bad person. Every one of those people are right; I am."

I'm 16 (17 in July) and atm I just feel like I'm not sure why I'm actually living, I get little to no enjoyment out of living, am socially anxious and constantly worried about what people think of me, I suffer with insomnia so get little sleep (self diagnosed and unknown to my parents). I have am studying at sixth form in the UK but don't enjoy school at all and am not enthusiastic about any of my lessons, I'm not a dumb kid by a long shot, but not Einstein. I have work tomorrow but to be honest I dont think I can drag myself out of bed at all or even leave my room (its an 8am-4pm shift and its 1:38am and I wont get to sleep probably at all tonight).

 

here is basically what I said to my gf who I have just came out to about this, haven't told anyone ever before and hate telling people hense staying  anonymous

1. im not enjoying anything and I have to work tomorrow morning, my parents are constantly worried about me and don't know I have bad depression, I don't tell anyone anything
2. but i don't want to tell anyone or do anything
3. i just want to stay away from everything and isolate myself
4. i dont want help from anyone because i feel pathetic
5. i wont reach for anyones hand because I hate it
6. i just want to stay away from everything and isolate myself
7.  but at the same time im screaming for help on the inside 

The way I act around my parents and everyone else on the whole is that I'm fine, but in reality Im far from it, I put on almost a fake persona in order to throw people off thinking Im like this because in a way it makes me feel venerable and ashamed of who I am, I also hate sympathy to the core and cant stand it, don't ask me my reasons as for why. I don't have abusive parents or anything, they are lovely, nothing to do with them if that's what some of you are thinking. I dont know if I want to kill myself or not, its one of those things that bounce around. I literally cant cry for some reason, Im emotionally numb and dont bring tears to my eyes. I just dont see why Im living anymore, everything seems like a chore and life doesnt have a exciting or even satisfactory tick to it. 

Idk why I reached out to here, just looking to see if anyone was in a similar situation/has any ideas about what to do about work/has any ideas or support in general. (told my parents I didnt really want to go in tomorrow and said I might pretend to be sick as Im not really needed tomorrow (working overtime)  but they said something on the lines of ""we go to work everyday"" and stuff like ""its the real world"" which to me is slightly patronising."

If I were to die… I think I’d be happier. Not that I believe you can feel anything once you’re dead. However to be nothing, to no longer exist, is surely better, and indeed happier, then how I feel right now. Would I ever kill myself?  No. For that would be a big decision and I am unable to make big decisions. However, thinking on it. To take my own life is something that I’d actually be in control of. I in life, am not in a position where I have any control. Not on my present, not on my future. I have seen my future. What it looks like if I am to continue the way things are now. And it is aimless, hollow, regretful & sad. Just very sad.

I have a dog whom I love, but I no longer want. I made the decision to rehome him. I wanted to rehome after less than a week of having him. I knew immediately I had made a mistake. My parents told me that’s not how responsibility works. We must stick with our decisions. 4 years later, I still want to rehome him. And I don’t care how cold or selfish that sounds. My friends who know me, my life & and my dog, all agree that it’d be for the best. So I was going to do it. I felt like for once I am taking charge of my life. But no. Life has other things in store. My always healthy dog, has now developed health issues. If he is doomed from now on with a life of bad skin, how can he be rehomed? Who would take that on? But also how could I know they will care for him properly?

I’m stuck in a job that I hate. And of course people have little compassion for a girl who hates her job, when her job pays well and allows her to work from her bed. But I can’t stand it. I sit there looking at my computer screen feeling so unfulfilled. I was an overachiever at school, predicted for such great things. So how have I ended up here?

My parents have made poor life decisions. They are not financially stable. I see their future. Them at retirement age. And I can’t see how they can survive without support. I remember being a young teen, praying to some higher power, that my parents can be financially stable so I don’t have to worry. And then as I got older I realised even more just how truly financially fucked they are.

I help with my dads business. On top of my full time job. And it is overwhelming. And it has impacted my relationship with my dad much more than either of us care to admit.
I offer to help, I want to help, but I am resentful. And then I feel awful for being resentful. My parents are awesome hard working people. Two people that I love more than anything. I don’t want to see them struggle. And therefore, unlike what my older siblings say and do themselves, I cannot just abandon them and live my life.

My dad has numerous ailments. I’m in charge of chasing his appointments and sorting his medication. My mum suffers with depression and she struggles to think about the future and deal with any issues in life really. Which is funny, because when I have a breakdown she looks at me like I’m crazy. But that’s because she can’t understand that I’m trying to think of solutions to fix things. And it is overwhelming. But someone has to think. And no point going to my dad to think of solutions, he just gets so angry. And it’s impossible for them to think of a solution together. It’s like they speak different languages to eachother. 

I was offered a PhD opportunity again recently. Which is something I’m regretful I didn’t pursue when I finished university. So it’s nice an opportunity has popped up. But a stipend of £16,000 and even with a part time job, wouldn’t be enough to fund my life and help my parents. I mean, if I still have my dog, a PhD would be impossible anyhow. My dog has difficult behaviours and only I in my household can care for him (I haven’t even been on a holiday since I’ve had him. My parents have though. Of course. I mean he’s my dog, my responsibility). Sounds mad right, that you’d put your life on hold for a dog. And yet that seems to be what is expected of me.

On top of it all I’m stupidly insecure. Like I hate myself so fucking much. My personality. The way I look. I can’t stand me. Like listen to me now even waffle on about my “oh so awful” life. Jumping from one topic to the next with no direction. Just like my life, no bloody direction. Just stagnant. I am so stressed, so overwhelmed. I feel that I just want to be gone away for awhile. I want to be able to just check out of life for a bit.

I always say to everyone I’m afraid of commitment. In every aspect of my life. I think it’s because I’ve just had so much responsibility on my shoulders. I just want freedom and control of my own life. And I can’t have that. Not really. Not without guilt.

One day. I will be middle aged. It’ll come sooner than I can imagine. My parents will be gone. My dog will be gone. And I’ll be alone with having achieved nothing in my life. I’ll be in a career I cannot stand. Maybe then I’ll have the courage just to end it all.

Y’know what. Taking my life today would be such an easy solution for all of it, to escape it all. Sure the mess that I’d leave behind fills me with guilt. But once I’m dead, I’ll feel nothing. So that’s okay."

I started getting medicated after confessing to my family that I'd been dealing with suicidal thoughts for roughly 5-4 years and bursts of depression for 7-6. That was earlier this month.

About a week after they upped my dosage to 1½ every day, I had a really good week and thought, like the dipshit I am, that I got lucky and hit the right kind with only minimal adjusting right of the bat.

And then it's been like three weeks and change of intense suicidal thoughts every day. So yeah. Probably not doing better.

Does anyone have any stories about meds working for them? I need something tangible to look at when I start to feel like it's all wasted effort."

Secondly, I‘m a fucking dumb bitch. I have no friends. I suck at art. I suck at video games. I’m just fucking mediocre. 

I’ve been suicidal for months now and have even tried killing myself in the bathroom stall at school. I just can’t fucking take being shit at everything anymore, nothings fun anymore, everything just reminds me of how much I hate myself. I’m only living because I think about a world where my pillow is alone since he’s my only dear friend I have, without him I would of killed myself already. He’s been with me since all my “friends” left me saying that they “broke up because of the pandemic” even though they fucking walk next to me while I’m sitting by myself everyday at lunch. I think they also ignore me because I‘m a femboy. I guess I also have my kitten, but whenever she goes near other people like my brother and gets comfortable I get scared that I will be alone and that she doesn’t’ like me anymore. I’ve been doing art for about 5 months now and already want to give up on it. it was never fun in the Beginning and still isn’t. it’s always been my dream to be an artist, but I guess everyone can laugh at me now for giving up on something I wasn’t good at anyways, I wasted so much money on a MacBook and drawing tablet just to give up on art not even a year in, that’s how fucking pathetic I am. I can’t even fucking play video games right, I suck at every single one at play, I can’t even defeat Gyoubu from sekiro. I don’t even know if this is the right thread to be posting on, I’m sorry if it isn’t. I also don’t even know why I’m ranting on here, no one’s even going to read this shit I WISH I WAS FUCKING DEAD.  


Anyways, I’m killing myself on my birthday, don’t try and stop me please"

My girlfriend doesn't seem like the kind of person that could cope with the thought that their partner could be suicidal, they also don't seem to be the kind of person to be able to help in the first place so that's a big fucking no.

I don't have friends that I feel close enough to reach out to, and the rest of my family would be so disrespectful about this stuff and call me an attention seeker.

I looked for help and no one is listening even my therapist have done nothing to help only done that dumb talking like always and no actual stuff that would help me.

I have severe social anxiety and depression. I used to see my girl friends every week or so and my bff every weekend. I kept doing that no matter how bad I felt. 
But since summer vacation i went downhill and started starving myself too. I went from a bmi of 19 to 13.3. I became more anxious rapidly. Before summer vacation my school told me they basically didn't want me to continue, not because of my grades but because they saw me struggle so much (when i tried to go to school i got panic attacks in class. Eventually I was too anxious and emberassed to show up and only was present at online classes).

Then my new psychiatrist quitted and I had to go to another one which made me feel uncomfortable and i had to open up all over again. Not making progress for months. 

So it went downhill so fast when school/studies started again for everyone except me. They all develop, get better, get somewhere. Instead of getting somewhere of even being stuck or on pause, I'm falling down at speed. 

I Haven't seen any of my friends since july. I ignore all their texts.

Everything makes me nervous and anxious. Going to get groceries with my mom once a week, walking my dog once a week with my parents, going to my appointments. Texting. Etc. Even Food makes me anxious now. I hate how calories are all I try to focus on. I need it to stop. I'm selfish, I know. I can't recover I've tried for years and it never gets better. I just end up hurting everyone.

My psychiatrist has a few weeks off, she told me that if I'm unwell and seriously concidering suicide, i should call my doctor, the police department or even her. But I can't call, the social anxiety.. So I just promised her. I nodded and smiled and wished her happy holidays. I don't want to disturb her or anyone. I know she'll say she wouldn't have suggested I call her if she didn't want to be bothered but I think bothering her just isn't right. I'm thinking about taking a shit load of medication. At my current bmi, taking 21 pills of these at once will most likely do the job. Some part of me wants to text my bff that I've neglected so much. But last week  I sent her a christmas card being all funny. Why? I didn't want to have her feel like I hate her. I have always coped with humor. I know she'll be scared when she'll see me. But i would tell her because it would make me feel as though I at least tried to reach out to someone before doing it. But the chances of her sending one of those quotes like youll get trough this are big.  Im sorry this post is so messy its 1 am. I just have absolutely no clue what to do. So here I am."

I really want this person to stop so I want to be able to tell them the current headspace Im on so they get the severity of the situation. I also feel selfish if I were to not tell them about me being suicidal and I they end up hitting a nerve leading to me actually hurting myself. Ive been feeling worse than usual lately due and they know Im struggleling which is why they decided to attack me with that ""tough love"" but they dont know I've been actually considering killing myself for the past few days before I even spoke to them.

When i get so depressed I can’t take care of anything like my cat or myself the way I should (no he isn’t neglected I just ask my boyfriend to help). Dbt skills don’t help for very long (maybe helpful for a few days or so) and I end up back in the same IOP program again on all types of medication and they end up making me feel worse- basically all they suggested when I said I self harm was to go to the hospital or the crisis center but their response is always “go to IOP” “just stay in IOP”. I just have a tone of suicidal thoughts and have neglected myself but then I get a boost of energy and can’t sleep well and have closed eye hallucinations- usually like this every winter (I have major depressive disorder) ironically I went from OSFED to just overeating in the course of the past few months with no ability to get my ED treated properly cause there’s nothing near me that treats OSFED. 

Living seems more painful than dying and leaving all my shit behind. If depression and anxiety aren’t treatable after 10+ years + when a traumatic event happens I develop ptsd and an ED and all I do is make other people upset when I’m upset anyways so wouldn’t it make sense if I just left so they wouldn’t have to deal with me anymore? Surprisingly I’m somehow worth their time and effort but in reality I have so much trouble even going into treatment with a positive mindset due to the unhelpful past experiences and apparently I am supposed to be open minded to treatment but it’s like I’m trying and I can’t seem to get anywhere so I might as well just self harm and contemplate suicide because it’s gotten to a point where I am a burden on everyone else and I might as well just make things easier by leaving them knowing I’m not suffering anymore- people say “oh there’s light at the end of the tunnel” “oh there’s better coping mechanisms” but I don’t even understand my coping mechanisms and my happiness doesn’t last very long before things turn to shit. I honestly think I was a mistake that shouldn’t have even happened anyways I mean who wants to raise someone who just makes everyone’s life frustrating because they ask for proper mental health treatment and they can’t seem to get anywhere with it"

Worst of all is my health issues (autoimmune, hormonal). When everyone abused me it was understandable I just learned people were evil but now my whole body is turning against me. I would deal with all else if I could just have health. I can’t even say it out loud but I’m officially diagnosed now - I’m losing my hair. It was triggered by medication but they say it’s progressive and im very unlikely to get back what I lost which is more than half. My mom calls me vain, insults me. I wish I was a guy, bald guys are attractive. I’ll look like Gollum in a month at this rate. My boyfriend is supportive but I can’t deal with this. He deserves so much better. He deserves a beautiful girl to marry and have children with (I was also told I wouldn’t be able to have children).

That’s not what this is about though a coworker “I” barely knew died, but that’s not the case for most of my friends at work… they knew her very well and are all pretty affected by it. It brought up some memories of Loss in my life. But all in all the way I feel now at this moment is jealously and I know that’s so fucked up, I just feel like I’ll never get that same level of care unless I’m dead… and maybe not even then. 

I am liked but I don’t feel loved by anyone really. I don’t feel like I’ve made an impact on anyones life in that same way…. 

This all happened yesterday, but honestly for yesrs I’ve had feelings like this especially the last few months. Recently  I got all the coworkers I’m close with   really nice custom  gifts (based on media they liked). Just cause well honestly I wanted to have some impact on peoples lives with gifts they would remember me by.  Last night a friend mentioned to me… that getting people a bunch of gifts is manipulative… and admittedly I got the dude I love way more gifts than anyone else… (it’s not someone I’m with it’s a straight friend of mine I’m gay) 

There was a week I felt a bit better but today it all just came back in full force. 
I just feel like the couple people I have in my life won’t care about me until I’m dead and everyone else is just terrible. All I ever wanted is to have someone that wanted to know me… and remember me.

Its ""funny"" to say this but I don't have anyone. Nobody cares, my inbox is empty, no calls. And yes I hide everything behind the smile. Like, I know alot of people. But its because I'm always the one calling/ texting and trying to meet up. Once I stop doing so, nobody cares. Nowadays I feel like I'm like 5th wheel when I text or call someone.
 When I'm around, people I make jokes, people laugh. But once I leave, I'm forgotten. I'm like ghost. 
And yes, I actually do get calls and texts. But only when someone needs something. Or one thing I have realized, people call/text me when noone else is currently available. So I'm a backup plan. And when someone will get available again, im forgotten. And don't tell me to find new people. I know ALOT of people. And i know alot of people because I have already tried finding new people. Same outcome all the time.
Why you ask? No idea anymore. I'm always trying to be helpful and I really really don't like when others are sad. And I always try to help others as much as possible.
Wanna hear more how ""amaizing"" life i'm living? Well, 1 week before Christmas my gf broke up with me. And I had a presents already bought. And because these were the ones that she for a very long time wanted, I decided to give them to her anyways. Long story short, no reaction from her at all. She acted like I was a total stranger.
On top of all that, few days ago I saw a girl that I have ""liked"" for about 3 years. I mean I like her personality and style etc. And now 2 days ago we stayed out the whole night and the whole time (yes she was sober), it seemed like she likes me too.   The way she talked etc. You know how this looks. And now, she acts too like I'm a total stranger. Mostly now she ignores my texts. And she doesn't belive that noone calls or texts me. And now she is doing the same thing.
I do have a job and place to live etc etc. I'm just all alone. Yes I know some of you will probably say that its okey to be alone sometimes but for me it has been like this for about 5 years. Maybe more. Don't know anymore.
And yes, I was alone on Christmas too. Merry Christmas
And nowadays, don't know, I feel tired. I feel tired to hide everything behind my smile. And ofc I have tried getting help. But people who don't feel like I do don't know how to help. I'm 100% sure of that.
I'm tired. I'm tired of caring for everybody else but no one cares about me. I'm sooo tired. And please, save the time to tell me things will get better. 4 years ago i got told that. And well, nothing has changed. 
And because somebody will probably ask this, yes I have suicide thoughts every day, multiple times. And I always find something that postpones it. Like I'm here so yeah. But I don't know how long I'm able to find things to live for. These are getting more and more smaller every month. 
Why I'm writing all this? Not even to get help here. Just to let you know that there are people who smile, make jokes and are caring and helpful. But you take them granted. You don't know how they feel once they are alone at home etc. 
Let's be honest, If i would die today, for about week, maybe even more, nobody would realize I'm gone. (Don't try to sugarcoat it with there is definitely someone who will notice) So when the end comes some day, trust me I tried. I know its utter chaos what I wrote but english is not my main language and there were too many thoughts all at once. Thanks for reading"

Had an argument with my sister about me wanting to head back to where I live because I should spend time with my mum instead. We're visiting my hometown fit Christmas and my poor Mum is receiving chemo. 

The other day my mum and I had a bit if a disagreement - the usual when we speak about my job. I'm off at the moment due to mental health reasons and I'm starting to realise I'm not cut out for full time work. My mum hates the idea of me cutting my hours, but I feel that if I don't do it, I'm not going to last very long. I can't cope with my mental health. 
This is usually where my mum explains that she did everything she could to get a house mortgage, raise 4 children and so on. That I won't be able to do anything on half pay. I feel as though she is very disappointed in me, which I suppose is fair enough.

I know it's selfish to feel this way but I've just had this feeling for a while now. That it's time to go. Maybe my family members would understand how much I want to die if I just did it? 

I've been told that I don't do anything to help myself but I'm on medication. I'm receiving therapy. Yet, here I am. Still contemplating.

If I was gone, my boyfriend wouldnt have to keep supporting me, hes a good guy, he deserves more. If I was gone, everything would be quieter. If i was gone, i wouldnt have to burden anyone anymore. If i was gone I wouldnt have to ask for help just to pay my bills. If I was gone, things would be easier.

I could tell someone how I feel, but what will that change? I will never be enough in this life"

It seems like I'm going to feel this way again. Two suicide attempts later and each one already becomes harder to forget, each one now adds to the chain of evidence teling me how badly messed up my psyche is relative to people who ""function"" ""move forward"" ""perservere with determination"" I wish I was like that, how I desperately wish that was reality...I wish I didnt want to blow my head off despite this situation i've been in. Either way, we can wish all we want, and as valid that might be they usually don't come true. I don't want to accept my existence, my situation...I just want to end it because it shouldnt have been a reality in the first place. ""Life is beautiful"" ""Life is gorgeous"" I wonder if a concsious entity could look at my life that way. Can we really fault the weaker flame for burning out faster than the stronger ones? 
Can we fault the cancer patients for dying to their cancer? 
Who do we fault when theres no one to fault? There 's no point in faulting just like there no point in living. 

IF I had a purpose or something to live for THEN it'd be different...Its just all of this is chaotic and I have to look here and see my families disappointment, and then I have to see myself do one nefarious thing after another which makes me lose selfrespect and shameful for my own existence. Of course I feel like something is fundamentally wrong with me... I do things I don't want to do like masturbation, and engage in porn addiction as well as me sleeping all day and being a disappointment to my family. Death is my wish because I want to end this. Who woudln't want to? If I could put a stop to this I would. But I have no control over anything I feel like, my own life, the world, other peoples opinions and not even my own. I feel like nothing I say is original, I'm just an ant. I'm very ok with feelings of incredible shame, guilt, sadness because the value of happiness, acceptance becomes even more valuable. Of course, this world is a cruel world and im a sensitive person trapped in the middle of it. I feel like ill never be loved by anyone else. I feel like I have no control over anything anymore and thats what pushed me towards suicide ideation. I want control over something, but Im plagued with dissonance...I cant even kill myself properly...so im not truly in control of anything. I'm lost... truly lost, and suicide seems inevitable and looks like my fate, but life is unexpected so we'll see what happens. 

Good luck to everyone and cheers to anyone afflicted with mental illness and anything of the sort."

For the first 4-ish years of my life I was a pretty skinny kid but something changed when I was 5, I started putting on a lot of weight despite me being a very active kid back then, I'd go into the bushes with my friends, I rode my bike, I went to the pool, etc... when I was in year 2 I already weighed 40kg and by the time I was in year 6 I was 60kg. Surprisingly, doctors never talked about it or mentioned it which is weird bc i would think they would mention it as it sounds pretty concerning. Rn I my jeans are a size 14 while my mum and my 21 year old sister's are a size 12 or 10. I'm really tired of being the 'fat friend' but my mum doesn't let me go outside or to the gym (not like I'd like to gyms scare me) by myself and she won't come with me. I used to walk my dog everyday until one day another dog attacked him while I was by myself and I couldn't hold on to my dog and since then I haven't been allowed to walk him. I don't really have a big appetite and usually don't eat breakfast. It's far too late for me to start a sport and I'm really not good at sport either way. I don't want to be super skinny I just want to be like 50kg or smth. How can I lose weight when I can't go outside or start a sport? Exactly, I basically can't. I'm so tired of this, at least I can hide all my other problems but this one, everyone knows I'm fat. If I'm going to be suicidal why can't I be somewhat skinny and suicidal. I've tried to push myself into an eating disorder so many times, I've counted calories, I tried to vomit the food out but nothing ever worked. I don't care if it's bad for me at least I have a chance at being pretty that way. I was never able to lose that weight, I just want to be skinny. I'm so tired having no one even look my way.
