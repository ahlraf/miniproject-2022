I know what everyone would say. I pray and ask God to give me strength for today. I’m still holding on to hope. I pray this anguish ends soon. You’re truly blessed to have someone like me in your life. 

I honestly don’t think you even care. For what it’s worth, I do care for us. I shall continue believing and waiting for a miracle. This heavy heart won’t let me function today. I’m truly trying my best to put on a fake happy personality. If you only knew how hard it is for me to just get out of my car. Time to keep going."

They have a vaccine mandate thing but it’s not until a while from now. My step dad, mom, me, and boyfriend are all vaxxed, wear masks, wash our hands and do what we can. My father is against masks, vaccines, and think the whole thing should run it’s course. my father wears his mask (only at work) but refuses to get vaccinated.

Covid is running rampant through the place right now. Does my father get it? nope he doesn’t. My entire vaxxed (minus my young brother) family who wear masks and follow the mandates got it instead (My step dad got it first from work). Knock on wood, so far in the 3 days we’ve had it we haven’t had the horrible symptoms. That doesn’t mean we don’t feel like shit right now. We’re in quarantine, trying to isolate from my little brother as much as possible so he doesn’t get it, but it’s impossible to fully do it because he’s young and can’t care for himself.

My head hurts, body hurts, i can’t sleep well at night, i’m fatigued, minus a fever i’ve got all the works. And boy, does it SUCK. I’ve avoided getting it this long, but now that i finally have it i can’t even imagine how the people who were hospitalized feel. 

Sorry for this rant and if it didn’t make sense, my sick brain is having trouble making fully coherent thoughts at the moment."

Me and my parents just always sit at home, watch some TV, look at fireworks and then go to sleep. We never really do something special. Whenever I see/hear what other ppl do for new year and what kinda fun/crazy/wild stories they have, I cant help but feel jealous, sad and lonely. I dont even have any other famaily to visit. (Like grandparents) Im a student so I want to make the most of my time before its over, but I feel like I am just a boring loser who is just living a boring life, doing the same stuff everyday. And whenever I will look back at now, I wont have anything special to think back too. Its gotten to the point where I kinda hate newyear and any other holiday. Anyone feel the same?

I got this all in a text. He hung himself from a tree in his backyard, and was pronounced dead an hour later, I visited him in the hospital about 15 minutes before he died because I wanted to say something to him. He was unconscious but I didn't care. I said I hope he goes to hell for leaving me and my mum, and leaving my mum when she was 19 to take care of a child herself for 15 years. For trying to kidnap me even though he wanted NOTHING to do with his own son or ex for 15 years. Fuck him. I was also really mad at him when he died because he was worthless. I usually have crazy respect and sadness for people who commit suicide, but for him I felt he had no reason to do it. He had a child with a different woman, who he also left she visited him too with her little 3 year old daughter. And she asked ""mommy? Who is he? Why are we here?"" And she said ""he's a bad man, a bad guy"" and the little girl made an angry pouty face. My mum didn't bother to show up. She said it was a waste of her time. And to be honest, I couldn't blame her, but I needed to curse him one more time. It's been 2 hours and I'm still comprehending how to feel. All I know is: my biodad is dead, and I am so dizzy thinking about it."

This year has its ups and downs and it got me to start therapy but along the way the recovery has been slow and painful. 

I thought things are getting better, and for a moment a few months ago I was very happy, but the past two months something was taken away from me by something unexpected and its been getting harder to be hopeful. I've been praying for better situations, better moments but it seems like every passing day its getting worse. 

Things are breaking left and right and its fucking hilarious as this year is coming to an end. These negative voices in my head keep getting stronger its hard to fight them off, and I have to do it alone. These past two months just emphasized it and damn I wish I had my person from 3 months ago, cause that whole month alone was probably the best part of the year, just that one month of meeting her and spending time with her. I fell in love with her.

Like damn just take me out already. It's the last day, I'm so tired. For a time I'd like my friends to take me out, like the way anti-heros go down. Cause if I go down at least it's someone I know and I wont he alone. But this tightening grip around my heart might just be enough, I just want to sleep."

The restless nights, the constant anxiety, the physical stress pains, all exacerbated by your shit. Expecting and knowing that bombs were going to be dropped every morning before work and every night after work. Having to feel suffocated and overwhelmed constantly. Having to watch what I say and try not to say the wrong thing so you wouldn't go off again, becoming a constant state of walking on eggshells. Having to deal with your insecurities and listen tirelessly as you constantly accuse me of cheating with no evidence or inclinations, just out of thin air as you spin these conspiracy theories because for some reason you couldn't trust me enough to not cheat. I have been loyal the entire time and haven't so much as thought about cheating, but almost every day you would come up with a new person I must be cheating on. Now that you're gone I am trying to learn to breathe again and trying not to blame myself for not ending it sooner or even starting it at all. Trying to deal with the lingering after effects, the anxiety that's no longer warranted, the paranoia that you may creep back in to fuck up my day. Trying not to crack as the people around me have this ideal image of you, while I have to suppress my knowledge of all the shit you put me through.  I can finally be free and move on I just wanted to share this with someone, anyone who is willing to listen. I am so ready for this new year and what it may bring. I can move past this past year and all the shit you put me through. I can focus on myself and treat myself way better than you ever treated me. Sometimes being in a relationship is cheating on yourself, and I have been doing myself dirty these past few months.

I felt fine this morning, but out of nowhere at work, depression is just BEATING me down into a emotionless husk...... I feel nothing now, I can feel tears building up in my eyes and I'm fighting to hold them back because I'm at work... I'm trying to keep on my happy face and stay positive, but it's getting more and more difficult every minute I'm here.

At this point I'm just hoping a car hits me on my way home so I can just leave this life and no longer suffer from this shit....

Anyway... back to work so I can keep on my fake face until I can leave and get home to do nothing hopefully.... well that can't happen because my family wants me to come over and celebrate with them (I really don't want to) but it'll make my mom happy so I'll be there... physically, but not mentally. 

I hope you're all having a better day then me. Happy new year everybody...."

When I first started working there I loved it; I used to bust my ass getting things done just because I cared so much about the job. Towards the end of the two years I realized I was being taking advantage of by management and left to work elsewhere. A year passed and I decided to go back to the job after I heard there was a change in management. I started off pretty strong, but a few months have passed and now I dread going to work. I call out all the time and make up bullshit excuses to go home early. I feel ashamed of myself everytime I do it, but that's still better than the suffocating feeling of being at work.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm afraid to vent to my friends and boyfriend because I don't want them to see me as pathetic. I mean, everyone else can work 8 hour shifts with no problem. The fact that I can't is sad and it makes me think I don't have much of a future since I can't seem to work.

Does anybody have any advice or feel the same?"

I'm in this stupid ass wrestle of what's real and what isn't with a long time friend of mine and feeling like we're growing apart and I'm truly sick of playing her mind games. She says she cares about me but I know she doesn't. I wanna cut her off so bad but I don't know how that would affect everything else.

However, that isn't what this post is about. This year I finally achieved my dream job after struggling so hard to land a job for months. I was unemployed as of March and I didn't get a job until July, and I didn't get the big one until November. I worked really fucking hard to get to this point (even with impostor syndrome nagging me as I type this) and I can say that 2021 is the year that I began to set sail on my true career path. I'm gonna be helping so many people with what I do and I couldn't be more thrilled to do what I want for once. The people at my job are lovely, supportive, and I'm being welcomed more and more into the team each day. I'm gonna give it my best every single day, I promise."

rszcwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rszcwz/should_guests_be_obligated_to_pay_for_food/,"Should guests be obligated to pay for food, transportation, and accommodation?",0,3,1640973178.0,"Years ago, when I was 20, I made a surprise visit to my aunt and cousins in Germany during Christmas. I showed up unannounced and uninvited. I was their guest. I had not seen them since I was 3. I wasn't really close with my aunt's children who are my cousins, I was only close to her. We talked on the phone before and I never saw her since I was 3. I live in the U.S. I booked my flight at the very last minute and it was around Christmas time and it cost me a fortune. I stayed at their house for a fortnight. I did not tell them I was going to visit them. They literally only knew when I told them from the airport. They did not expect me at all. It's like I was a relative who just showed up and called from the airport one night from a different country and said, ""Surprise! Come pick me up!""

I arrived at the airport at 11 PM and called my aunt to pick me up. She was so shocked and said, ""Oh my God! Pick you up? At the airport? Are you crazy or what?"" They dropped everything and ran to pick me up in the airport in their car and was asking me if I was crazy. When I was there with them, they didn't seem too happy with my surprise visit. It seemed they became irritated by me. My aunt spent all of her time with me, waking and asleep. She dropped her world for me. She didn't even sleep with her husband. She slept with me at night. She was always with me. She never went anywhere without me and didn't even visit her friends. I didn't receive the type of treatment expected to receive. They didn't even drive me anywhere except to run errands, and they were all short trips.We only went to grocery stores, a mall, a relative's house. They didn't take me to any tourist attractions. They didn't even take me to a single restaurant.

I never offered to pay for anything. I never even bothered to help cook or clean. I thought they would pay for all of my food, transportation, and accomodation. I thought I would be treated like a royal. When we went to the store to buy groceries, I didn't offer to pay and she demanded that I pay for the groceries. They only fed me at fast food places and home cooked meals. Even wanted me to eat leftovers eaten by other people. When we were eating at a fast food place, I finished my food first and she put her half eaten burger that she ate with her own mouth on my plate for me to eat it. When we went out to eat at a fast food place, my cousin's girlfriend, who was also a visitor at the time, but they knew she was coming, was buying food for all of us and my aunt said, ""Did you help her pay for the food?"" Why would I help pay for the food, when I already spent a fortune on my flight?

One time when we were at the mall, my cousin's girlfriend's son was eating fries, and they wondered if they should bring the leftovers home and she snapped and said, ""She can eat that!"" When we were at home eating dinner, I was eating with my hands like I do at home, and she shouted at me and said, ""Is that how you eat in the restaurant? Eat with your fork!"" When I wasn't even eating at the restaurant. When they were driving me to the airport, she said, ""Give me money for gas."" I said, ""Why?"" ""Just give! You don't ask why.""

I was surprised that they expected me to pay for food, transportation, and accomodation when I was their guest.They were supposed to pay for all of my food, drive me to places and see all those beautiful sceneries, take me to restaurants, be chauffeured around, be treated like a royal. They drove me to and from the airport, and even asked me for gas money. They seemed to be having a financial hardship at the time. I heard my aunt saying she even needed money for gas.

Was I the one who was supposed to take HER out for meals? And also leave a buttload of $$$ for the maid service and companionship she was forced to provide? Because since I was there, she had to clean the toilets, the showers, and the dirty bed sheets? Maybe she didn't want me around 24/7 or even 1/7! They never asked me to visit them after that. Hell, I never even heard from them again! And I was surprised.

And WTF was that all about her handing me leftovers eaten by other people? What did she think I was? Some dumpster trash that deserves only leftovers?

When she handed me leftovers eaten by other people and demanded that I pay, was that her way of saying that if I was going to treat her house like a hotel, then I was bloody hell going to pay for it?"

I'm single, and it's been awhile. I still live at home. I did go to college but it was for an easy major. I work, but I need a better job. 

People have always thought I was smarter than I am. I struggled with math and science and I had a 2.33 gpa in high school. I also barely passed Spanish. I hate that I didn't become bilingual. It's such a nice skill to have. In college I got my GPA up to 3.26 for graduation. 

People have always thought I was smarter than I am until they learn the truth of course. I just don't drink or do drugs. That's it. Beyond that I am super mediocre. I only thrive in low level settings. Like I was president of a club in my college, but it was a nerd club, and no one wanted to be president. At work I'm known as a top employee but it's because we are underpaid for our job, so sometimes the employees aren't that great.

I'm just hurt and I don't really don't know how to process this. My therapist told me that I need to learn that people in my life are incapable of giving certain things. That I should learn what I can expect from my family and what I can't. That doesn't really make it feel any better.

When my brother had yet another relapse  and stint in rehab, he was all our mother thought about. 

When my aunt had to cancel on a family vacation a few years ago because of illness, I called her and spoke to her for over an hour. I thought I would at least hear from her. Nope.

Same thing a few years ago when the race riots in my city were almost at my front door. It was all over the news, but not one family member checked on me.

You only get one family (other than the one you make, and I don't have kids) and mine are all very self-centered people. How does one deal with that?  I don't know if I should say something or just keep my mouth shut."

Every little thing brings me down.
I just want this year to be over to be honest. 

So this year wasn’t pretty good for me.
Less than a week into 2021 I got covid. I lost 2 jobs through the year when I had nothing to do with it. I went through a really though break up lately that left me heartbroken. I’m feeling lost. I feel like I don’t get the credit I deserve, I don’t get the exposure I need. I’m not making enough money and can’t get my own place. I feel that my life stuck. I’m feeling lonely and i’m really pessimistic and anxious about the future.

I’m anxious that i’m just wasting my time at the wrong job, that i’m a failure, that i’ll stay single and end up lonely with no one around me. That the best is behind me.

I wish 2022 will be my year.
The year that my business will succeed. That I’ll finally get the credit and exposure I feel I deserve. That i’ll find better love than my ex. That i’ll feel loved, appreciated and valuable. That i’ll be healthy. That i’ll get my own place and i’ll make enough money.

Probably just hopes and none of it will happen or at least most of it, but if there’s any time for hope or trying to get a fresh start that’s the time for it.

Happy new year"

I had some steak in the freezer so I pulled it out to thaw and we drank some whiskey and talked while we waited. By the time we were done cooking we were both buzzed and chatty, talking while we were eating. 

Suddenly my boyfriend looked at me panicked. I asked what was wrong and he said nothing but his face began to turn red. Unsure if he was joking around or serious it took me a minute to register what was really happening. He was choking. I ran over to him and asked if he wanted my help, which seems strange but I'm an introverted person and to perform something invasive and somewhat violent like the hemlich I still felt like I needed permission. That feels so odd looking back on it. He sort of shook is head in affirmation and I pulled him out of his chair and wrapped my arms around him, trying hard to remember what I was taught in my wilderness first responder years ago. It took a minute but it worked! He was breathing and we both sat there for a moment, adrenaline pumping. I held him and we both took a breath of relief.

In that moment after he returned to normal I got flashes of what it would be like if it hadn't worked or if I hadn't acted in time: the possible aftermath in that moment, trying to perform CPR, calling an ambulence, the loss of him...maybe he would have been fine but maybe things could have taken a turn for the worst. 

We've officially been together a year today and just thinking about the possibility of him being gone brings me to tears. He's such an all around wonderful, selfless person and he deserves to live a long, happy, life. I'm so happy he's alive and so glad that he's a part of my life."

He got sick around thanksgiving and it got worse from there. He had a heart attack and had surgery and went through rehab. He seemed to be doing well for awhile.

I try to be a rational, level-headed person, but this man  legitimately makes me want to commit murder. I often think about poisioning his food, which would be the most feasible way for me to do something like this. Or I fantasise about him getting killed in a car crash, or some freak accident. I know that I won't do anything stupid like this but I really do like fantasising about it. Besides, he's an absolutely terrifying man, so much so that I feel anxious even speaking a few words to him. And I don't to end up in jail and further ruin my life. 

It's New Year's Eve and he has gone on an abusive and drunken tirade. I wasn't going to do anything for tonight but I thought that maybe I'd peacefully watch a movie or eat some cake with my mom but he's ruined that, just like he has ruined everything else. There are a few days of peace that I can get at a time and I really, really wanted spend tonight like that. He has ruined several birthdays like this throughout my childhood, and several other days which were significant to me. Honestly, him dying wouldn't really change anything much on a practical level. He's unemployed, a waste of space and useless to society. And on top of that, he ruins the lives of people around him. So he should just die. 

I feel like he has ruined me as a person too. At this point I'm just damaged and exhausted, I don't even have the motivation to try and move out, or to better myself. I barely feel like I'm a human being. I have no hobbies, no interests, no motivation, nothing. As much I want him dead, I wouldn't mind dying instead. I just don't want to go through this anymore.

He has been in and out of rehab for the past few years and my mom has been nothing but supportive of him and his recovery. However, every time he gets out of rehab, he starts drinking again the same day. None of the treatments are helping and I don’t think he even wants to get sober at this point. 

Today I got a call from my mother, and she tells me that he strangled her. Thankfully, his health has deteriorated over the past years and he is not as strong as he used to be so she was able to get away.

This happened after my mom came back home from a short trip (yoga retreat) and he accused her of having an affair. She has never cheated on him and never would. She keeps telling him this but he doesn’t believe her and calls her every slur you could think of, which after he got physical and started strangling her. 

After she got away from him, she left home, went to the police, and is now safe at my aunt’s house. 

I feel extremely guilty for not being able to be there in person for her right now (it’s a 14 hour flight + covid…) and I don’t know what to do…

But it has been years worth of build-up to get me to this point, and it is so much more than just the pandemic.

I have always been someone who has tried to do the right thing, but I'm tired of being blamed and shamed for the problems of this world, the problems that governments and people in power neglect to fix, time and time again. 

Shame on all of us for not stopping climate change, right, because we were just too selfish with our plastic straws. Nevermind that our governments won't invest in public transit to get cars off the roads, nevermind that we're decades behind in where we should be on green energy, never mind that when electric cars were initially rolled out they were so expensive I couldn't afford one even if I wanted one. But I still stupidly showed up to the grocery store every week thinking if I just kept using my reusable bags we could finally kick this pesky climate change to the curb, amiright? Save the turtles, y'all.

Or every single time I felt guilty ordering something on Amazon. 

Shame on you, consumer who needs something, why are you not sUpPoRtInG sMaLl BuSiNeSsEs? Why are YOU not supporting small businesses? I'm tired of being shamed and blamed for shopping with what limited options I may have available to me, while the government refuses to tax the wealthiest man on this planet, won't help employees unionize or at least raise the minimum wage, and local and state governments give tax breaks to Amazon to set up shop in their districts. But the consumer is the one at fault.

And finally, we arrive at the pandemic. Another global problem that our leaders have completely bungled. The pandemic never should have been politicized. Shame on every politician who downplayed the severity of this virus because they were too afraid of losing voters or losing an election. But the other side is not without fault either, because you can't keep blaming and shaming people for not following rules and then constantly failing to set any rules. It's confusing as hell when every state, county, and business operates under a different set of rules, and you yell at the people for not understanding what's expected of them. 

I am tired y'all. I am so, so tired. I am tired of being an individual contributor to society, and being held accountable for the problems that our elected officials are supposed to be solving. You were literally hired to do this! You were hired to fix this stuff, and instead, the blame has been pushed off on the working class for decades now. It has been our ""fault"" and our ""responsibility"" to solve problems that I simply cannot give a flying f\*ck about anymore. Just do something. Literally, anything."

I guess this is what people mean when they say long-distance connections never work. 

Did I focus too much on work? Did I focus too much on my hobbies? My self? Why did it have to come to this? Did I do anything wrong? Maybe they all secretly talk behind my back and decided to drop connections with me.

I need somewhere to say this. I talk about a lot of stuff in therapy, but because my feelings have been denied so many times by my mother (the person I trusted and loved the most in the world) in the past, I can’t talk about it to anyone anymore.

I think I was abused. Not badly, of course. You’d probably be sure of it if it were severe, but, you see, I’m terrified of my stepdad. I was from a very young age. Perhaps that’s normal? To be incredibly afraid of a parent? A stepdad, maybe? 

Only, I think I know why I am so scared. Why my entire brain and body shut off every time he lashes out and why I actively try to leave my home for days at a time when I know he’s in a bad mood.

I think he was abusive. Maybe his punishments were normal. Aggressive shouting, yes, parents get angry at their kids, but there wasn’t anything good to balance the punishment out. He was just this man who would yell at me, tell me these horrible things he and my mother thought of me, and sometimes poke, grab, push or even hit me. 

Perhaps the punishment may have been normal for any other child with a good relationship with their dad, but he wasn’t my dad. He was a stranger. Somebody who was replacing my dad. (Who I was rarely allowed to see due to his alcholoism)

I hated him. Actively despised his soul and prayed to God every night for his death. The sound of his footsteps up the stairs would make me jump and hide. 

Around the time my stepdad moved in, I began developing anxiety and attachment issues with my mother. I have memories of severe panic attacks at young ages (6-9) and was so afraid of making one wrong move in social situations.

I’ve complained about my stepdad’s abusive behaviours to my mother a few times in the past, but every time I was told his punishments were normal and that he loved me. She always tries to manipulate me by telling me how much he’s done for me (money, roof over my head, food etc). I think after a while I just started to believe I was being dramatic, just like my mum said.

But even now, though I stay out of his way so he rarely lays a hand on me, I find myself going into some kind of trauma response every time he’s irritated or raises his voice. I plead God to make sure no minor inconvenience happens (dog annoys him, wifi buffers, someone else in my household gets on his nerves) so he won’t take it out on me. 

Maybe I’m making it all up. But surely it isn’t normal I’ve been so terrified of him for all these years?

I’m mostly making this post to seek the validation I never got. To finally feel like maybe there’s a reason for my excruciating mental illness and have someone tell me that yes, what you went through was real.

Edit: I think it may be worth noting I have a strong fear of men and also a fear of rejection. I rarely lead conversations or request things because I am terrified of something bad happening and feeling the way I did when I was younger when I said the wrong thing to my parents. 
The fear of men I never understood, but when you grow up being terrified of this man who you only know as a stranger, I guess it kinda messes with your perception of them."

I met with my biodad a week ago, we went to a donut shop, got Donuts and coffee or whatever. We were walking in the park, it was 5pm and it started to get dark. My mum texted me and said ""Hey when are you coming home?"" My ""dad"" asked if I wanted to have a sleepover at his place, and I just said ""nah, that's okay, I'm gonna run home."" He looked real mad and and pushed me into some bushes. It was real sore because nettles and twigs were digging into my back, where I recently had scoliosis surgery. The bush broke my fall but it still hurt. He ran and a few minutes I just lay there in pain. He got his car and pulled me out of the bushes and pushed me into his car. I couldn't even comprehend what was going on, I was just dizzy thinking about it. He got in and locked the doors and I screamed at him, asking him where he was taking me, what he was doing.. I was so scared but then I remembered I had my phone in my pocket I took it out really quick and texted my mum. She asked where I was and I told her because I recognized my surroundings, and I told her where we were going so she called the police, and once we got to my ""dad's"" house they were there, and he got arrested and he's going to court for attempted kidnapping. I never want to see him again."

rswolt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rswolt/my_father_died/,My father died ...,3,0,1640965706.0,"and I don't know how I'm going to stop being furious. There was *so much* we needed to talk about, and now we never will.   


He loved me. I have to say that first. I absolutely knew that, always did. He was an amazing provider; I never knew him to be out of work longer than a week or two my whole life, and usually it was two jobs, or three. He left a high-status position in the police service in our tiny country to bring us -- me, primarily -- to the USA, and he did everything from cutting lawns to painting apartments to scrubbing toilets when he had to, to make sure we had rent and food and the electricity turned on. For two-thirds of my life, he was a gentle, giving person. He'd give a stranger his brand-new shoes off his own feet and wear his old ones another year even though they had holes. He woke stupid early to take me to school before he went to work, and stayed late to collect me, often without even eating lunch till we got home. Everybody loved him.  


But let's talk about that other one-third. He and my mother battled like opposing air masses, and God help anybody standing there when the storms struck. If you happened to be one of their children, you tended to be standing there a lot. I was eldest, and a girl besides, so I got the worst of it, shielding my siblings, because clearly nobody else was going to do it. When I was little, those fights included him hitting her. When he stopped hitting her, though, he didn't seem to feel he should stop *her* hitting *us*. Instead, he would try to explain and justify her abuse after the fact. I never understood why the fact that she had a miserable childhood meant she was allowed to make mine miserable too, though, and I never understood why this man who wanted to save and protect the whole world wouldn't protect *me*. 

Turns out, when home is a battlefield, a conflict-averse introvert doesn't thrive in it. Especially when it's made clear that the Plan is that she helps raise her siblings, then gets married and produces grandchildren, then helps care for her parents, with a spot of financial help and a lot of guilt in the bargain. ""We give you everything you need."" They didn't. They never knew half of what I needed, because I knew better than to ask them for things, and they certainly didn't ask me. I just counted the days till I could legally leave home, and I almost didn't make it; my first suicide attempt came at age 12, and the next was age 16. In between, I almost managed to starve myself into the hospital. But that birthday came, and I left home openly, the first time. 

I made it two weeks. After that, he and my mother came to where I was staying and kidnapped me. He put one hand around my throat and the other on top of my head, and he forced me into their car. When they got me home, I was kept from leaving the house or seeing anyone or even making phone calls for months. Oh, but he *did* show up in my doorway that first night -- to tell me *he'd* forgiven *me*. My forgiveness, apparently, was neither required nor desired. Like it never crossed his mind that I could be angry, or that my anger might be important at all. We never discussed it again. 

The next time I left, it was straight from school to a shelter, and I stayed gone until well after my first marriage and my first child. I lived with them twice more over the next ten years, but it was never peaceful. I could never relax, and I kept leaving. He hated that I kept leaving. It hurt him that I kept leaving. Me, I hated that he never tried to make home a place where I could want to stay. I would have given anything to have more drives with him, to have him there when I married again, to be able to bring my babies home and know I could rely on family to care for them and me, to treat them kindly, to deal with me as if I were a valued person and not just someone who owed them something. I would have loved to not need to be on the other side of the world in order to be able to just deal with them without obligation and guilt trips. My life would have been so, so different. And now ... now he's gone, and any chance that I might eventually have *that* father is gone with him. And somehow, I have to just *accept* that. Right now, I'm not making a very good job of it."

Or at least i think they are. Here's the problem, I'm always unsure if I'm overreacting to their statements and attitude or if they are  toxic, racist and homophobic, because they're very good at convincing you otherwise. 

I've known them since 2016 where we became friends but our friendship took at turn and the authorities had to get involved because it seemed like they had attempted to blackmail me.
We both seemed to mature after that and became friends again around 2018/19. 

However, they only ever talke to me if they seemingly needs to vent about their problems, and don't seem to listen if i need to talk about mine, it always diverts back to them. They'll ask for my advice and my opinions on things and do the complete opposite, they'll then call me to vent about the consequences of theirr decision, whether that being taking back a toxic ex or friend.

I'm part of the LGBTQ community, my friend feels it's appropriate to use slurs such as fa**** or tra**y to either describe someone who's trans or use fa**** as a joke towards me. Apparently it's okay to use these words because the LGBTQ uses them too, and therefore they can. (They are straight and cisgendered) they also don't believe the LGBTQ have less rights than others, and thinks pride shouldn't exist because homophobia doesn't happen as much

The same goes for racial slurs, such as the N-word. POC can use them so in their opinion so can they (they're not a person of colour) especially because they're in raps and other songs produced and written by POC. They also don't believe racism is ""that bad"" and it's not an issue anymore according to them

I have tried educating them on why  they shouldn't use racial slurs and homophobic slurs even though some POC or members of the LGBTQ might use the slurs themselves as well as the inequalities POC and members of the LGBTQ face.

They still throw the slurs around and get mad when I point it out, and make me out to be the bad guy.

I have been distancing myself a lot, and we haven't spoken for months, for these reasons because I don't want to be friends with someone like this. 

The other day they messaged me and told me I have an attitude, I assured them that I don't but they evolved it into a petty argument I didn't reply to.

This person has a tendency to guilt trip you if you try to leave, i have guilt issues already which makes it hard to block and unfriend them, because i know what things they'll say about me and I will likely not be able to return to my hometown if i cut them off, or at least that's how they make it feel.

I'm completely stuck because I don't want to be friends with someone like this, I've tried educating them but they don't listen and leaving feels impossible.

Any advice?

TL;DR
My Friend only talks to me when they need emotional support, and they use racial as well as homophobic slurs but they guilt trip you into staying"

Aside from my childhood friend I’ve cut contact with everybody else, blocked accounts, deactivated you name it. My childhood friend was always a year younger than me, she was always my little sister kind of but now she’s going to college, she’s completed all her exams. 

On the rare times I go outside I see people my age working jobs, on the rare occasion they even have kids with them.

My parents are getting older and so is my family. My brother is in his final year of university, my parents talk about what’ll happen when they die and older family members are beginning to pass away.

And I’m still the same. I’ve not done a single thing in the past few years. I watch my mother cry because she’s watching me destroy myself and I don’t feel anything. She deserves a better child, when she tells me she loves me I know she’s just trying to convince herself of that. But it’s okay, I still love her a lot, I can’t blame her in the slightest. 

The rare few friends I have are beginning to become tired of me and I can just watch on. I can’t keep pretending I’m not painfully lonely, I chose this life for myself and this is how it’s going to be how it ends. 

I’ve always known I’m never getting out of this town. I told myself I wasn’t going to die until I saw Arizona, but I can’t keep pretending I have the strength for that. 

I’m constantly homesick even though I never leave it. I’ll forever be stuck missing days that have passed and the delusions that I’m comfortable here are also beginning to crack. 

I’m so tired, in a way that words can’t even describe."

Sometimes if the scans were super interesting, I.e. broken/crushed bones, items lodged in places they shouldn't be, brain tumors. She would make extra copies of the scans and bring them home to show us. 

If anyone's ever wondered what it is like to be raised by a psycopath who is trying to care, this is it.

Now being that it’s New Years/Christmas week break we have a few staff on leave to visit family whom live rural and so forth so after that and the Covid staff we are left with 4 senior staff (including myself) and 4 new trainees.

As a manager it’s in my contract that I am not awarded double time for public holidays so I am entitled to public holidays off.

Since 9PM I have received 2 calls from senior staff saying they are unfit for work due to being sick (unsure if they are or not) meaning tomorrow we will be with 1 senior member and 2 new staff (well below the operating minimum for a branch my size) 
After calling my boss for advice I was instructed too bad the store must run and I’m required to be there effectively ruining my night and plans to ensure that the store stays open on New Year’s Day. 

Due to the wide spread Covid I am unable to bring in staff from other stores so they don’t get it from my staff whom are still awaiting test results.

I am beyond frustrated with the way this has been handled and it’s causing me to lose faith in the leadership of this company.

Every single year I feel like it’s taken every last thing I had, and every year the next year reminds me of what little I had left by taking that too. But thinking about what I lost in 2021 isn’t just depressing cause I lost it, it’s mostly depressing to think that those things were really all I had going for me. Depressing to think I was surviving on such fucking table scraps and even those were taken. 

Started the year with I job I fucking hated, but one that let me afford my shitty, cockroach ridden shoebox of an apartment so that I could live alone. It was a fucking gross apartment, but at least I was free in it. If I was still there I’d be blasting music over speakers rather than having to use headphone like I do right now. But I got way too fucking depressed to be able to work and had to move back in with my toxic fucking mother, just like always fucking happens when I claw my way outta here.

Moving back in with her cost me every fucking freedom I had. We got another wave of covid here almost immediately and since my mums such a paranoid control freak, she won’t let me leave the house (says she’ll kick me out if I ignore her and leave anyway), can’t go to the fucking gym anymore, can’t ever be alone cause her and her fucking husband are always here, she even opens my fucking mail “in case the envelope has covid”. It’s fucking ridiculous, I’m fucking 22 and I feel like a fucking teenager again.

Also had the last smouldering embers of my one and only friendship I’ve had this lifetime finally get snuffed. It was realistically treading water when the year started, but I guess I didn’t realise how much I still valued the once per months she’d text me outta the blue and the 4-5 consecutive replies I could get outta her before she was gone again. Been 7 months now. Knew it was officially dead when I didn’t get a “merry Christmas” text. She always used to send one. 

A day later the last of the two goldfish she bought me died. Didn’t think that’s bother me, I didn’t even fucking want them, specifically told her not to get them at the time. But again, it was just one more thing I had but don’t anymore. Probably all for the best though. Didn’t want the goldfish, knew when she bought they’d probably wind up being a reminder of a friend I’d lost. 

Fuck her though, she clearly wasn’t interested in being friends for months, glad she finally grew up and stopped checking in each month. Probably only did it to make sure I wasn’t dead, guess all it takes in one little suicide attempt and all of a sudden people feel the need to fucking put you on life alert at all times like you can’t be trusted to take care of yourself. Can’t wrap my head around why she’d fucking bother anymore though, she pretty clearly didn’t fucking care to spend any time or even really talk with me while I was alive last year, so why the fuck does it matter to her if I was dead? 

So yeah, 2021 took my last few freedoms and autonomy, the last thing I had that even sorta resembled a friendship, my pets that I low key didn’t even want. Can’t wait to fucking see what 2022 reminds me I have only to fucking rip out from under me. Maybe it’ll finally be the year I get it all over with and kill myself. Not like I have anything to stick around for. Don’t fucking enjoy anything anymore at all. And my life is just gonna be a constant loop of moving out, getting my freedom for a while until my mental health cripples me, stops me from being able to work, and forces me back to my mum’s. Got no future anyway."

We were soul mates and spent nearly entire college years together. Things went downhill and eventually we did break up. I didnt handle it correctly in that I still loved her and I couldn't let go. She knew this and didnt want to let go either so I ended up being strong along for about 6 months post breakup.

In that time she had found someone new, gone on vacation with him and lied to me about it the entire time. She even told me that the wanted to get back together while she was with this guy, unbeknownst to me.

Anyway so I found out about all of this and I broke things off. I couldn't stand the thought of her lying to me like that and I didn't want to just be the backup plan. 

I texted her about 6 months after all this happened, about a year after broke up to see how she was. She had moved in with this guy and had a job and seemed to be doing okay. This was nearly 3 years ago. 

In the meantime I started and ended a serious relationship. But since that relationship ended I have had probably 20+ dreams about this girl in the past month. It feels like every night. I think about her during the day too. I relive the revelations about what was truly going on at the end and I feel the immense pain associated with it all. 

Last night I had a dream that she came to a party I was at but she had changed. She was bitter angry and cynical. She seemed to be a corrupted version of the girl I loved all those years ago. Like the person I fell in love with was dead and this husk was merely all that was left. It was terrible.

I dont know what to do. I cant get all of this out of my head."

I hate showing my anger - but oh boy, when I get angry, it gets uncontrollable. 

We are having a barbecue party IN MY BALCONY because it's cold af at the rooftop. I am completely okay with it, but what the fuck dude, ask me once??? My balcony is pretty and big - no wonder why they would love to arrange the barbecue party there. Fuck this. I do not like my family members because they do not acknowledge their toxicity and narcissistic nature. 

I have a party to attend tonight, but I gotta be around here too. I don't wanna come back home. Thankfully, my mother isn't going to the party with me. She's a belligerent woman, who does nothing, but only fight - even with strangers. I'll be taking my sister(s) with me. The last time we went to a party, organized by the same host (they are my relatives), mother had abruptly left the party because apparently, her aunt had told her that she's a quiet person. My dad came after her, and she locked him outside the house because she was mad. Fuck this.

Anyways, I'm not gonna let ANYONE ruin my life anymore. I'll no longer be KIND to anyone. If you want to fuel the fire, don't be surprised if the fire doesnt extinguishes.

Like she would light up when she’d talk about him. Well, his friend wanted to get to know me and she gave me his number. The way he was texting was off. I don’t expect perfect grammar and spelling but the way he was wording his sentences was as if English wasn’t his first language. Which isn’t a big deal but you’d think someone claiming to be in the military would be able to at least text a full sentence, but I could be wrong. After only talking to him for like 5 minutes he asked me about having a baby with him which was really weird. I started asking questions about him. Where he’s stationed, where he was deployed out of stuff like that and he would either take forever to answer or avoid the question and get upset about me asking these questions. 

The entire time I was talking to him her guy didn’t message her once. We both thought that was odd. I asked him to send me a pic which he ignored at first and then told me that he’s not allowed to take or send pictures of himself for security reasons. 

He claimed that he was doing his laundry. Ok that’s fine. When he was done he and I resumed the conversation I finally got him to send me a pic. He asked me who my friend was. Now my friend had gotten his number from her guy who says he’s in love with her and wants to marry her. The guy I’m talking to is supposedly his best friend. But he has no clue who she is? And then suddenly he knew who she was and that his friend is madly in love with her. 

I asked him a few more questions and he got upset and didn’t understand why I was asking him questions again. He then had to go make his lunch so I told him that I’d let him go and he could message me later. He told me he loved me which is super odd. Homie doesn’t even know my real name lol. He knows the name I go by, my age and that my birthday is in March. But he loves me?

My friend and I were talking about the conversation and I told her how he worded his texts was off and that it took me three tries to get a pic of him and I told her about the comment he made about having a baby and that he told me he loves me. I then noticed that the guy she’s talking to seems to have similar problems with texting full sentences and the way the both talk it’s the same. We now think that they are both the same person and neither of them are military personnel. 

I asked my fr if her guy ever asked her for money and she said yes. So I told her the next time he asks tell him no and see how he responds. Apparently this had already happened and he got really upset with her and tried guilt tripping her into sending it. Again very odd. 

I’m pretty positive that these guys are one person scamming my friend. I’m not ok with this. So we take their pictures and put them through a reverse photo search. The guy I’m talking to doesn’t come up but the guy she’s talking to comes up on an adult site for beefcakes under a different name. 

So then we look up their phone numbers and neither one is from the state these men are claiming to be from. At this point I’m convinced that this is one guy who is a scammer. 

I feel like I should have stayed quiet about it though because she’s really genuinely hurt. She knows that I would never do anything to hurt her. I also didn’t want someone taking advantage of her. I’m not going to sit and just watch someone do that to her and that’s why I spoke up. It hurts seeing her hurt. I don’t know if I did the right thing or not. What do you guys think? Do they sound like scammers or am I just to untrusting? Did I do the right thing? Or should I have left it alone?"

I understand that divorce can cause issues for a child, but I feel like it would have been better. 

Sometimes I resent my mother for not divorcing my father, then I feel bad for thinking this. Then the shit show happens, as it always does, and I'm left with this feeling again.

I still remember hearing my father threatening my mother, and thinking to myself, yeah go ahead and hurt her cause ill just go to the police station and report you. Then you'll finally receive consequences for your actions. Then comes the guilt again, for wanting my mother to get hurt.

I see my friends' parents being happy and respectful to each other. They don't blow up at minor issues. Sometimes I wonder what it's like to have a non-toxic family. What's it like to have grown up in a healthy environment? Because I feel like it's always a matter of time before shit happens (and it does, frequently). 

Please, if you're having issues with your marriage, go to marriage counselling. If it doesn't work, please don't put your children through hell in the form of an unhappy marriage. Maybe there is no easy way out, but all I know is that raising children in an environment like this isn't great either."

I have no living memory of them ever being together.  The guy my mother chose after my father couldn't have been further than her first husband.  Different culture, education level, and personality.  He was a real dick, still is and my mother decided after 20 years since her first child (me) she would have another with this piece of shit who was barely present in the life of the kid he already had.

I was furious when she got pregnant.  Their relationship was tumultuous, I woke up to EMT's in my house once because she had overdosed on prescription pills over a fight she had with him.  He kicked me out of the house when I stood up to him for all of his bullshit and I ended up doing the same to him years later when he'd abandoned his responsibilities as husband and father leaving mom and my newborn brother alone in a city hundreds of miles away.  

Unsurprisingly my brother is all fucked up from having a father like him and I've tried what I could to be there for him as much as I could living in another city.  I saw him going down a pretty dark path and tried to get him to come and live with me but his father vetoed that idea because of his hatred for me though of course refusing to take him instead.  I arranged for him to go to a private military academy out of state and he prospered there.

There was peace in the house and he had the structure he lacked at home.  The pandemic saw to the end of that and within months he'd regressed transforming his body with tattoos and gold teeth.  He totaled my mother's car (with a baseball bat) and home office before being placed in a juvenile crisis facility after he was arrested.  

My mother has zero control of the household and answers to the beck and call of a petulant 15 year old.  He's a rude asshole just like his father and I struggle not to hate him.  Speaking to my mother is depressing and just makes me want to cut her off completely.  I struggle with what exactly my responsibility is as a son.  I've intervened before spending tens of thousands of dollars to educate a kid who isn't even mine and barely shows any appreciation.  I wonder if it even did him any good as he's reverted to the ghetto life even though he's never lived there or had to deal with the struggles.

I bite my tongue most of the time but today snapped on her because there is absolutely no logic in any of the decision making.  I resent her for making all of these fucked up decisions with men throughout my life and having to **still** deal with the fallout of a guy I haven't even seen in ten years.  Impressed if you read this far, thank you.  Happy new year.

He was fine two months ago, and almost ready to come back home. A family falling out, and covid took that strength he had gained. 
He is my rock. He grounds me while my head is in the clouds. But he is also my wings, because he has always picked me back up everytime I've fallen. 
He didnt have to raise me, but he chose to. He raised my mom, so he knew how many mental problems i could grow up having, and he did anyways without a single complaint.
He always went out his way to make people laugh. While working the bread route, i became known as the cake girl at my church, because we brought extra snacks and bread for people. 
He taught me to be tough, yet gentle. 
He taught me to love like you will never be hurt.
He taught me that life doesnt always work out, but its what you make it, and you better accept it after making your actions.  
He lived his whole life for others, raised an entire family that wasnt his, and was tortured mentally by his wife his whole life. Hes on his death bed and shes still calling for that court ordered $666. 
He taught me that forgiveness is the closest we can get to God. It is not easy, but the right choices rarely are.
He taught me so much, but even once he is gone i know there will be more to learn, and he will be watching over me while I experience the rest of what life has to offer.

All that work and I still get anxiety. For instance I had a 2nd date this week and had a frustrating work day. I was feeling off and anxious for the date and did not portray myself as very confident.

I know texting a stranger about someone they don't even know isn't the greatest thing to do, but my family is really religious and frown against pre-marital relationships, so I can't talk to my family ,so I just really had no one to talk to and I think its the best time to do it as I need advice, I can't afford a counselor as I'm a broke student, so you guys are my only help. Let me share my story, I will try to make it as short as I can. I live in Africa, I went to the US on my own to pursue a degree at a university, it's 2020, I'm in the US, covid comes out of nowhere, the first year of uni ruined, can't go back to Africa, I stay in the universities residence. I get drunk one night, I meet this really beautiful girl called Amber, i bag her number, we hit it off, 3 days later we’re having lunch, we just kept vibing, hanging out more and more, studying, going on dates and walks, sleeping at each others cribs. After sometime We have a convo about relationships and both agreed that we really do like each other and a relationship tag shouldn't define how we feel about each other. We keep seeing each other for 4 months( would do everything but have sex, both are virgins, at least I still am, it's just the way I was raised to frown upon pre-marital sex and to stay away from instances that will lead to that, I mean I want to have sex but never had a chance ). Then the semester ended and i went back to Africa , covid got bad and US closed its borders, so I couldn't go back on residence and see Amber, 8 months go by and we were still talking a lot through texts, share stories, always reassuring each other that feelings for each other are still there. September 2021, I go back to the US, meet her spontaneously in the middle of a crowd at homecoming, I was drunk as fuck, she was sober and just came from the library, we start talking a lot again like we used to, start seeing each other almost every day, Still sleeping at each other's cribs and still doing shit together, midterms come up, she says shes stressed, a week goes by with no contact, I text her, she says she still is busy with midterms, I say okay, a weekend comes up and I text her on a Friday saying i want to see her, she says ill see her on sunday. I said okay, same night( Still Friday) a little later, she says she was going out on her regular walk and wanted to see me (Midnight). Comes to my door, everything starts good, then she tells me that she feels bad that shes not putting in effort and that she doesn't know how to as its her first relationship, she tells me shes asexual (Which is bullshit as i could tell from the way she was so passionate every time we would make out, but I did ask her to have sex in the past and she said she wasn’t ready ). To sum it up Basically she told me she isn’t a relationship person and thinks we should be friends, i agree with her offer to be friends, i tell her ill come to her house to pick up my shit the next day and that we would be friends as she has always told me she wants to stay friends no matter what happens as im "" the funniest and most interesting person she met in her life"" at this point i realized she was lonely because i know I'm not that funny nor am i interesting im a 4/10 at best when it comes to being interesting, not even putting myself down. Anyway, i agreed to be friends the same night, she hugged me and went home. Next day comes, I wake up thinking im the biggest wuss for staying friends. I tell her im coming over to pick my shit. Walk to her house , See her and straight up told her "" Hey i know i said i can be friends yesterday, but i don't think we can be, i obviously still like you and it would eat me up staying friends with you. So shocked she looked at me as she always thought we would stay friends, she says ""Okay I understand"" we hug for a minute and she tells me "" It was nice to meet you"" I told her "" Same, you can always text, bye"". Walked away feeling like a boss, I know I did get dumped so I should just shut up, but that really felt good walking away, because i don't know it just made me proud that i picked my self respect and dignity over a girll i loved and walking away from something is the most badass thing you can do, at least for me.Ive been dumped before where i did no contact for only 30 days, then texted her straight away, sent her love letters, would talk to her whenever she sat alone in the library( we went to the same highschool). Basically i knew what not to do with Amber and not beg at all, even though I really loved her. First month of no contact was Oct 30th to Nov 30th, was a tough first month, got through it, wasn't going to text her instantly,kept stalking her socials, kept redditing stupid things like ""Does the dumper miss you"" or ""Does No contact really work"", the usual bullshit after a breakup. After the first month is done towards the end, i would think about her like thrice a week compared to all the time, i wouldnt check her socials, was going out and partying, meeting girls, everything was actually going well, you may be wondering why im posting this if im doing okay, the thing is things arent okay. After the first month, I see someone who looks like her on my street in my neighborhood ( she knows where i live as she used to come over), i think nothing of it, i know she likes to take walks and runs , i tell my roommate, we both agree it was either not her or it was a coincidence. I forget about it. A week later my friend runs into my room shouting ""Creep” i didnt get him at first but then he tells me to look outside, i see Amber Beautful as usual in her short ass pants going on a run, she was staring at my window (shades were closed, she didn't see me looking at her). My road doesn't have a dead-end but out of all the roads why pick mine, she doesnt even keep running on in a straight line she goes two houses after , takes a uturn and runs by my house again 30 seconds later, come on i know this isnt a coincidence, why would she be running by my house, dressed like that. If she ran straight on it would make sense but she made a u-turn to run by my house again, IN THE SPAN OF ONLY 30 SECONDS. She's on my mind all day, again. She also looks exactly like one of my celeb crushes who is Zendaya, now with the new spiderman movie that zendaya is in, i keep seeing Zendaya everywhere, on billboards, social media and everytime i think of Amber. December 30th marks 2 months of pure no contact, she hasnt seen me, heard from me, no texts nothing, i dont like her posts, don't view her stories, nothing, 0 contatc. I dont know what to do, i really like her still, seeing her recently made me remember why i liked her. What should i do? I am really tempted to text, i miss her like crazy, i was doing so well, but if she keeps walking by my crib , its gonna be so hard, I've only seen her twice, but God knows how many times shes been by my house and i didnt know. What do I do? I know texting will make me look weak, but i like her and i dont know what to do. I just wanted to let like everything out, ive had noone to vent to, i dont mind if no one  even reply’s to me, because writing this helped get some weight off me. Do you think she still misses me or wants to be with me? Whats the best thing to do that will leave me happy, thats all i care about. Thank you so much for reading this and i appreciate your wisdom. Ps after sometime we were actually dating, We were together for 1 year . Its been 2 months( dec 30th) ."
rstl68,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rstl68/my_pastor_makes_me_uncomfortable/,My pastor makes me uncomfortable.,151,70,1640956200.0,"    I have to talk about this because I don’t have the will to tell my parents as we’ve been going to this church as long as I can remember. Sorry if this is a mess, I don’t post much. 
   Anyways, I’m a minor and my pastor is in his fifties. So I go to church every Wednesday and I see my pastor and a group of other minors to talk about God and Jesus and all that. Recently, I was sitting on a bench in a large room as we were waiting for some more people to arrive. My pastor came over and looked at me and said, “You know, no one but pastor [blank] could say this, but you have very pretty eyes.” And then he stared at me some more and left.
     I felt so uncomfortable , and the meetings after I began to notice that he would stare at me… a lot. I love my church, but I hate whenever I go because all he does is stare at me.

I don’t know if this fits the sub, but I can’t keep it in but I don’t know where to go

TLDR; My pastor told me how pretty my eyes are and constantly stares at me which makes me uncomfortable.

EDIT: Thank you all for the advice, I told my parents last night and they were angry. They told me that I don’t have to attend church until the problem is taken care of. I’m thankful I don’t have to deal with it anymore, and I realized that I should tell my parents first when a problem like this happens, Thank you everyone :)"

We get along really well, have loads in common, and have even been on holiday together. She doesn't always open up but she knows I'm here for her. And she's supportive of me too.

I've had a really difficult 3.5 years but am almost at the end of that; she has had a difficult year and is nowhere near the end as she only just separated from her husband who she's been with for over 20 years. 

Its her birthday today (31st December) and she had a 4 day weekend booked with her husband, which he was no longer going to attend. She asked if I would, I said yes. 

With Omicron we have been on the verge of lockdown for weeks, and then she caught Covid on 21st December, so we weren't sure we could go. 

Then it all seemed okay, no Covid for her, no lockdown. We booked things. We travelled. We had a nice day.

I felt tired and had a slight cold but I haven't really stopped lately so figured I was just run down and nothing more. 

We has just finished getting ready for a night out. Then I got the text we all dread. Two people I spent Christmas with tested positive. We were all negative at the time. I tested and it came up immediately. 

We both cried as that was exactly what she didn't want to have happen - to be alone on her birthday. But I couldn't stay and we both knew it. I packed my stuff, we said goodbye and I went home. 

She's making the most of her trip and I'm happy for her. She has found a meetup she can go to tonight, ironically to the same venue we had planned to go to. She isn't mad at me but I know she's disappointed and sad. As am I. 

Happy birthday C. I hope 2022 is a better year for you, and all of us x"

Now, I must say that I'm not originally from Norway but from another (poorer) European country, so me moving to Norway saved me from a rather worse life I had there, and I'm very grateful for it. But I just love some aspects from the life in the US. I know there are many problems there, and lately it's even getting worse I think, but in my opinion, it's the land of many opportunities, where you can be whoever you want to be, you can literally move from state to state and you would have a complete change in the lifestyle. You can move from Texas to Alaska and the change would be enormous.   I know I'd actually downgrade the safety and financial part if I manage to move, but I still think my life would be happier there than it is here. It sucks knowing that I'd most likely never live in the US, since I have no high education and legal immigration is close to impossible for me."

I was always happy for Jon, and was excited when he did the occasional speech in D.C. to get 9/11 victims the funds they deserve, or when he went on Stephen Colbert's show to do a bit on the lab leak. He was doing great as a guy in the shadows who steps back into the limelight for a moment every few years to drop a few words, then disappears again.   
So when I heard he was going to have a new show on HBO, I was pretty excited.  
Unfortunately, the show sucks. Does not look like it has occured to Jon or his producers that we are no longer in 2011. Everything about it seems overproduced and watered down through a 2000s era late night show. I dont know why Jon chose to model his new show after cable TV, when literally nobody watches cable TV anymore. I mean the late night shows are pretty much irrelevant at this point, the late night hosts today will probably be the last big name late night show hosts ever because the future is not cable TV, it is online streaming."

Which means we have common interests, to start with.

At the time we met, I was struggling to get into a good university abroad. I've just finished taking 5 GMAT exams, writing \~10 application essays or something. All my 2019 was used to taking exams and applying for schools.

He just take a huge Chinese postgraduate exam trying to get into a nice uni for master's as well.

We both felt tired and lonely, we started to talk about everything, and we just hit it off.

In April, I got into a top school in France, I was really happy, and we decided to meet in May.

After talking & sharing every bit of small things & getting to know everything about each other everyday for 5 months, once we met, we just fell in love with each other. And even though we knew I was going abroad, we made commitments since we're just so in love.

At the start of our relationship, he always felt like he didn't deserve me, since I'm hard-working, smart, I'm way less privileged than him yet managed to get into the top-tier in schools & exams, and I happen to have a nice personality. So he decided to be a better person, and so he did.

He majored in sports training in college, I don't know about elsewhere, but in China, it means you don't need to study, you just need to play basketball or something well, and 99% of sport training major students are stupid & ignorant as fuck. But he wasn't, he's into movies and music, and definitely not ignorant.

He decided to study abroad as well. Since his English sucks, I helped him with everything. Every email to the school asking for information, every application essay, I did them all. He prepared IELTS exams and short movies to apply for movie schools.

He got into a French school as well. But before he got the offer, I went to Germany to do an internship. When he arrived, I didn't receive my residency permit and I was afraid things might go wrong so I didn't go to France to see him. He was too busy with school and moving in (something wrong with his apartment and bank account) so he couldn't come to Germany to see me.

So 2 months went by, still couldn't get out of Germany, he met some new friends that really get along with him, and he became the game-killer in the class, since he's pretty talented & he has some experiences too while many students don't.

We had a pretty huge fight in November, I admit I fucked up, it was a stupid fight, I apologized, but he was a bit rude so I said maybe we can take a break. But only after a day, I called him back, and we got back together.

So 15 days later, in a random evening, we were just talking about stuff and having a good time, suddenly he texted me saying that he wanted to take a break too. Said he wasn't sure about us anymore, he was even afraid to see me, since if we meet in person and he finds out his feelings for me are gone, he wouldn't know what to do. I asked him if I should still go to France to see him, he said maybe not.

It was just so out of the blue, I couldn't handle this well, so yet another fight. And I said we've come to an end. And I've been living in hell since.

But still, we contacted each other after now and then. He came to see me in Christmas. We spent a week together. And nothing really changed, we still make love & kiss & hug each other like we used to.

His new friend in Paris came to Berlin as well, and 4 nights out of 7, he went out to have beer or dinner with him and came back to my place after. I was a bit mad, but he said ""do you want to keep me by your side 24/7 for 7 days? I can't have any time of my own?"" So I really didn't know what to say.

We talked about our relationship as well, he said he'll always love me, and will come to berlin to see me in the future.

He also said one of the reasons he broke up with me was because he felt like I'm not the same person anymore, that I lost myself in this relationship, that I'm not as independent emotionally.

I don't know what to say. For a year and a half, we were dreaming of building a life together in Europe, so i helped him with everything for him to have a chance to come to EU. I came here a year before he did, and we had a long ass distance relationship for over a year.

He said after we broke up, he was thinking of coming to Berlin and patching things up with me and getting back together. But I was so confused & furious, I couldn't believe if he's really coming, so I asked several times if he bought tickets. He said it made him feel under pressure, so he changed his mind and don't want to get back in this relationship anymore. 

He said the only time recently that he felt peaceful was with his friends. It broke mt heart. 

I don't know if it's him or me that I can't get over - I put in too much effort in this relationship. If it were't for me, he'd be in China working at a finance job that his parents got for him.

I put a dream in him, I did everything, choosing schools, contacting schools, helping him with IELTs, writing long-ass essays (mounting up to 5000 words in total). Now that he has this new life that I gave him, suddenly I'm not independent anymore.

I felt really lonely since the breakup, I use to love spending time alone, now I'm afraid to be in the apartment by myself.

I'm planning to meet more people & make more friends & also go on dates in the new year, but still, it just hurts me. Not only he was my boyfriend, he was also my best friend. Now I lost'em all.

If anybody could give me some advice, or some comfort, or anything, I really appreciate it. I'm just so confused.

BTW, he doesn't have a new girl in France, he's with friends nearly every day."

Just now, she was yelling because the kids were up at 5, which results to waking up the rest of the house. I don’t sleep easily. I don’t fall asleep fast or sleep deeply. So just about every noise that’s made, I wake up. Kids are kids. They’re going to wake up sometimes in the middle of the night. That doesn’t bother me. What does is the constant stomping around and commotion when something is disarray. I’m so exhausted writing this. I can’t even go back to sleep. I have to go to work in a few hours. I’m just so beyond frustrated. I just want to be able to sleep like a normal person. My mom even yelled, “what’s wrong with this family?” while stomping down the hall. Then she proceeds to tell me each morning what happened in the middle of the night and I always reply that I know, I don’t sleep well and hear everything. That irritates me more than anything else. You think I sleep through all of this? You’re delusional lady."

rsrwb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rsrwb4/being_around_my_dad_is_exhausting_for_so_many/,Being around my dad is exhausting for so many reasons yet no reason at all,2,0,1640949835.0,"About 1.5y ago I moved to a different city to attend university, and since I've been living on my own there, my relationship with my parents has improved tremendously, but I do not want to move back in. I do still visit occasionally for special days/holidays during summer and Christmas and things like Easter and Mother/Father's day if I have time. However, there's still considerable tension between me and my dad, with most of it coming from me. I'm turning 20 in less than a week so you'd think the teenager-parent conflict would be over but it clearly isn't. There's a lot to unpack here.

When I was younger I was a lot closer to my dad to my mom, partially because I felt ashamed of her as she migrated from Asia to here, has an accent because my dad & I's native language is not her native language, and whatever other stuff a kid is ashamed of when their parent is a migrant, so I was mostly siding with my dad. Undoubtedly this must've hurt my mom a lot. Over the years I've become closer to her, probably because I've started seeing the (borderline) racist things my dad has said about her / her family / ethnicity and how little he is able or willing to do around the house, which really gets on my nerves. He can't tell a lemon from a lime. This is not an exaggeration - he threw out a perfectly fine lime once because he thought it was a spoiled lemon. He doesn't cook so imo he has no business throwing out anything she bought.

Overall I don't think he appreciates my mom enough and I've told her to stop constantly doing things around the house for him, because he's an adult and should be able to at least make pasta for himself, but she's too nice so she keeps helping him out. This would be somewhat fine if she'd been a stay at home mom but she's always been working 3 to 5 days a week - in retail no less, which is widely known as not being the best field to work in. My dad has a mostly sedentary 9 - 5 office job. Basically I'm fed up with the lack of appreciation for my mom even though she deserves the world and neither of us were giving it to her.

For the rest I also think his existence is far too loud. I'm already sensitive to noise and to me it seems like he just stomps around the house and sneezes so loudly I could probably track him down in a snowstorm if he'd just sneezed at regular intervals. I know the dad sneeze is a common joke thing but it's not that funny to me when every sneeze sends me and my mom into cardiac arrest.

He'll watch tv and have the volume up so high that it gives me a headache and even my mom complains it's too loud, but he says otherwise he can't hear it. Same if the radio is on in the car - if it's too loud, I'll get a headache. Again, I'm sensitive to noise so my idea of ""loud"" is probably not the same as everyone else's, but by the same time I don't think it's fair if I have to deal with a headache or ear pain so my dad can listen to something. I understand that suboptimal hearing is just a part of getting older but my mom & I use headphones when watching something and I fail to see why he's not turning down the volume or getting his headphones. We have one of those fancy Smart TVs so it's not like he couldn't bluetooth connect something or get another cable.

A last big point is that I very likely have an eating disorder and/or autism (or as my psychologist person suggested, autism could be causing the eating disorder behaviors. It would also explain my noise sensitivity). I cannot for the life of me sit in the same room as my dad when he's having a meal, because I think his chewing is too loud, he doesn't finish his plate, doesn't hold his cutlery properly, and is way pickier than someone of his age has any right to be (he has no allergies / insensitivities / dietary restrictions), eats barely any vegetables but does eat unhealthy snacks despite complaining, mocking, or joking about other people's weight/health and his own weight. If my mom isn't at the table with us during a meal, I'll move to my room or else I'll just be angry for the rest of the day. My parents know about the ED thing and how annoying I find all these food-related things. I'm not expecting the world to bend itself over backwards to accomodate me I'd think he should at least finish his plate and hold a fork properly.

A lot of things do explain why I'd dislike my dad but I'm finding it exhausting to be around him, especially if my mom isn't there. I also realise that it isn't fair for me to constantly direct whatever frustrations I have towards him, even if his behavior is continuously triggering me. I try not to take it out on him and just move to a different room but it's exhausting and upsetting and I don't want to spend the rest of my life avoiding my dad because I can't breathe the same air as him without becoming unreasonably frustrated."

She left me with whoever or whenever. She'd Even go inside restaurants and feed herself while leaving me outside. She eventually started leaving me by myself fully. Even for days on end. Even when I was born, allegedly. I was used to walking to school alone. Walking home alone. Like she didn't even exist. Then one day. 

Our apartment complex stood on fire. Started at my 
bullies side that I prayed to god that he'd leave me lone. Funny how life is sometimes. And miraculously ended jist before our door. Me, my mother and my sister watched as the fire fighters took out the fire. 
I went to school normally.
I didn't know what else to do. It wasn't until I got back the first day that I realized my mother hadn't been back. My sister was running around the apartment unhinged. She had no idea what was happening. 
The next day I was hesitant but I left anyways. I mistakenly thought my mother would choose the better of the option and come back to us. By not only did she not return but she let the full brunt of me leaving my sister alone in a no power or water apartment on my shoulders. 

I came home. Not knowing what to do. So I went upstairs and told her friend what she had done. How she'd abandoned us. Even though I saved us. I will never live down how I abandoned my sister while I went to school for a full day while she was was in a dark apartment without power or water."

I've always been the fat guy, the shy guy and so on, but I've always wanted to change and be better than that.
2019 was the best year of my life. I managed to lose a lot of weight, I was a lot less shy and I had A LOT of confidence. I felt like I was finally becoming the man I always wanted to be. Unfortunatly my life had a twist: I got sick for a few months and I lost all the progress I conquered in 6 months.
Since then I struggled to regain that confidence in myself and I struggle (a lot) chasing my goals. I gained all the weight I've had lost, I started going to therapy again and my life has been very tough since. 
I'm grateful that I had and still have a family that loves me, friends that loves me, a P.T. That has been with me in and out the gym throughout this process and a lot of more great things.
But I still can't find a way to regain the confidence I need to start chasing my dreams again. I want to take all that I've lost but it's like I'm not mentally strong anymore to do it like the first time.
I don't know What to do anymore.

I’ve chased a cat around the house, putting it under a blanket and nearly suffocating it before getting a grip on myself and letting it go. The stress I caused it on numerous occasions is what I believe led to it being put down because it would always fight anyone who tried to touch it.

I’ve taken advantage of my ex, who has broken up with me, and I’m happy she’s free of me. I don’t want to hurt her anymore, and I’m trying my best to stay single because I don’t want to take advantage of anyone else. I don’t want to be toxic and abusive, nobody deserves that.

Now I’m beginning to have intrusive thoughts about children, as pedophilia absolutely disgusts me, yet I now overthink everything a minor does and sometimes see their actions as promiscuous due to my hyper vigilant mind. What was initially used as a device to detect pedophilia has inadvertently seemingly turned me into a machine that is incapable of seeing the innocence of a child, and so now I need to stop pursuing my desired teaching career and I don’t even want to have kids anymore in the fear that I might objectify them or my students. 

I’m going to therapy, but my therapist tells me that my issues are above their pay grade, and I haven’t even told them about these issues yet… I just don’t know how to stop hurting people or how to prevent myself from doing harm in the future. It feels like the person I’ve become has already stopped me from becoming the person I want to be. I want to kill myself, but I don’t have the strength to. Maybe I will one day. I just hope that day comes before I hurt anyone else. I’m sorry for what I’ve done, and I know nothing will fix the damage. I just hope that whatever I decide to do next will make someone happy rather than traumatized. Fuck."

I did not pay for his BS course, but wasted an hour and a half watching his useless webinar.

I thought I might finally be able to claim my own life, but I'm still stuck, no closer to having my own life, and I just don't want to go through anymore.

I just turned 26, caught the fucking virus RIGHT before losing my parents health insurance, and for all I know my joke of an employer might try and deny me the health insurance I signed up for because I got sick and infected RIGHT before the end of the year, I was afraid I'd get this stupid virus right before the end of the year when I lose my guaranteed and free health insurance (I also take multiple meds on a daily basis for the past 10 years, I can't function without them, one is an SSRI and I'd rather die than suffer the withdrawal from that).

I don't want to spend more years of my life trying to start a successful business, I don't want to go to school for 4+ years to MAYBE be able to get a decent job afterwards (when I'll be in my fucking 30s), and I don't want to go through another year of being abused by customers, managers, being seen as less than human doing meaningless labor and barely paid $350 a week for it, what a fucking joke.

I hate this fucking society, I hate American capitalism, I hate this fucking world. 

I can't go through another year bagging groceries and pushing carts, I don't want to be in ANY retail environment AT ALL, none of them treat or pay their employees right, they all suck. I can't go through mood swings from having to take so many goddamn pills all the time, and being dismissed as ""imagining it"" or ""making it up"" or ""exaggerating"" (DOCTORS DO THIS TOO).

I can't go through another year of being the awkward older guy working around a bunch of teenagers, can't drive a fucking car because of PTSD and constant road rage, inability to have a girlfriend or lose virginity, and just inability to get a decent job/source of income (fuck Mike Vestil and his BS passive income SCAM) so I can start and live my own fucking life.

Society is BROKEN, it is RIGGED, everyone is overruled and exploited by the 1% ELITIST BASTARDS. 

My parents continue to tell me I'm wrong or being ridiculous until realizing how ignorant they were and that I'm not as stupid as they act like I am, finally took me being sick seriously when I got an actual positive COVID test, and now my employer is making it hard to get the pay they're supposed to give infected employees. I don't even know if they're going to let me have my health insurance now, I can't just stop taking Sertraline, Oxcarbazepine (been on them for 10 YEARS) and Bupropion SR (which has gotten my ubncontrollable rage outbursts under control, PREVENTING ME FROM KILLING SOMEONE IT WAS GETTING THAT BAD BEFORE I TOOK THAT).

I just get older and older, my youth was a waste, it was meaningless, and I didn't really get to enjoy it at all.

I'm sick of stupid ignorant idiots telling me to just ""man up"" or ""grow the fuck up"" or any of that ""tough love"" BS, it does nothing but make me want to hurt them, or myself more.

I just get older and older, and nothing really changes, I hate the fucking real world, I do not belong in modern society,  and it just gets harder and harder to change anything.

If I try to go back to school, I have to work less, but I have to work more to keep that health insurance, and I have to pay more for Uber to get there, but I'll make less from working less, and if I just do it at home, that's just continuing my life of isolation and it is mentally terrifying (severely worse from fever dreams like being sick right now).

I can't even enjoy the little things anymore, like watching YouTube, playing games, watching shows, because reality is getting closer, time isn't slowing down at all, I'm not getting any younger.

I just keep getting older and still get no closer to being able to start live, live on my own, have my own place, have a girlfriend, have sex, I couldn't even travel the goddamn world without ""getting rich quick"" (those other things don't require that, but require being able to live on my own, and even making a LIVING INCOME can't be gotten quick).

Even SLOW AND STEADY success, isn't guaranteed, but that's still depressing because I didn't get to enjoy any of my youth, not even my goddamn 20s, which are almost over, and most certainly will be by the time I could realistically achieve  any type of success, financial or otherwise. 

Money does matter, it's how we're literally able to live, and there's an excess of jobs which pay FAR BELOW even a BASIC living wage, and inflation is only getting worse.

So many people ARE working from home, supposedly for more than these crap jobs, but I still don't know what they're doing or how to get into it.

It seems there really is no genuine legitimate way to get rich quick, and the quickest thing you can achieve is an income that can't even cover rent and bills, it's all a goddamn joke.

I'm not 18, or 21, I'm 26 now, I missed out on everything, I'm expected to be past it all, but I never lived any of it, and I don't even know how to get into life FROM THIS POINT.

I just don't get it."

I only remember now that the situation got extreme very fast in the way that I physically fought with any student that came my way and it wasn't just regular fighting. I felt very powerful but I think at the same time very guilty but just kind of more subconsciously when I sometimes seriously injured people in my dream. For example the school I was in in my dream had many stories you could access with steps and I was at a very high story when I fought with someone and then threw him over the ceeling so he fell down from a probably deadly height. I even saw people I knew in real life from school in my dream who never did something to me but I acted aggressive towards them in the way I talked. It was overall a very sick dream and I think it has something to do with how I am not able to process feelings of guilt in real life. The dream had a very stressfull ending too: I began to realize the consequences of me beeing basically a less violent form of a school shooter and I felt that everybody around me knew that I was evil. I even had to sit in front of a jury like in court but in a classroom and different teachers from the school I didn't knew were judging me for what I did. My thoughts always swept from ""it wasn't that bad what I did"" to only a very quick and anxious feeling of ""I fucked up"". At the very end of the dream suddendly our family dog appeared in school which I had to look after so I decided to take the bus home but I didn't take the dog with me. Then I was in panic when I arrived home but  he was outside in front of our house already and I realized that he had run all the way after the bus which made me feel very guilty again and again I didn't really know how to process this feeling: I was scared that my dog would think that it was his fault and he looked a bit scared of me when I tried to pet him which also fucked me up. Then I woke up. 

I don't know why I have this kind of internal fears with beeing evil or guilty but just writing about it is making me feel really vulnerable. I actually have a clue that this stuff could come from my childhood because my mom was always very judging towards me as a kid like I was always the bad one and a ""problem child"". She also sometimes compared me to other kids in terms of how well they behaved and what they could do. What is sad to me is though that I actually did behave in ways that could be seen as evil when I was a child. I remember that when I was very young there was a fish pond in our garden and I took out a fish and put in on land because I wanted to see what would happen to it. I'm glad that i realized that it would die and put it back in the water though. That was when I was maybe 6 years old I think. When I was 9 I went to elementary school and there was a situation which actually had a very similar atmosphere like the one in my dream: my father was always very trusting towards me as a kid in terms of knowing what is morally right and so he sometimes gave me things a child probably shouldn't have in that age like a pocket knife. In the situation that was similar to my dream he gifted me a not working lighter which could only generate sparks. I took it to school and beeing with a friend I wanted to impress on the way back home (or I dont know the exact the reason), which was the same way for all the kids of our class, I started pointing the lighter very close at the other school kids to threaten them which of course scared them. When I got home I think that all the parents called my mother so its needless to say that she was extremely upset. She forced me to reenact the scene and show her on her how close I pointed the lighter at the children. Right now I don't even know if it's good for me if I'm writing this here to be honest, because I kind of feel exactly as bad as how I felt back then. I don't really know if I'm an evil person. Sometimes I think that I was just a kid and this is normal, which is what my sister tells me too when I speak with her about hings like that. Then again I feel like I'm evil or guilty and this is the reason why I often repress my feelings and feel disconnected to myself. I sometimes think that not even too deep down my mother has a big problem with guilt too because she always acts like she was just beeing accused of doing something bad but already in her head declared to the accuser that he is wrong and she ""supposedly"" didn't do anything bad. I mean by that that she comes of as someone who is always persuading herself (and others in the way she talks) that she has nothing to feel guilty about in a very general sense but subconsciously must feel the opposite of that. It always feels to me as if my family is way too fucked up even if it doesn't seem obvious on the outside. It feels like there is always something that is unsettled in the room. I feel like there is something wrong with me because I can't even write about what I really think and feel most of the time because I'm scared that I get judged or criticism for it. And when I do write it just like I did in this text I distance myself from my feeling of anxiety of writing about it which probably takes my chance of getting relief out of it, so it's probably not #offmychest (lolol just kidding).

I don’t mean much to very many people, and those that I do would have overall better lives if I didn’t exist. I don't want to burden or bother anyone with this nonsense, so here's to tossing my woes at strangers on the internet.

My boyfriend and I met on an online game. I lived in the middle of nowhere, he lived in a nice city. The home I shared with my mom began to have problems and became unlivable. She moved to a small senior apartment, I moved in with him and his mom. It’s been 6 years here. I got my bachelor’s degree late, an art degree with dumbed down coding and other tech applications. I wanted to be a concept artist or character artist. I learned a lot of things and gave 110% in every project, but was unable to find an internship in my time there. I didn’t make friends or network, I’m socially inept and so anxious around people that my heart races and I get all clumsy speaking to almost anyone. I tried medication for this, but it didn’t help much. 

In my last semester, this past year, I got cancer. I racked up credit card debt, and student loans to pay my expenses while concurrently finishing school and going through chemo. 

Now school is finished, the cancer is gone (to the best of my knowledge), and I work constantly just to pay the interest on my debt and cover the rent I pay to my boyfriend’s mom. I don’t make a lot of money doing freelance work. I call it freelance work to give myself some legitimacy, but it’s really just art commissions, the sort that people do as a side hustle usually. Sometimes I think my work is pretty good, but then I see real professionals, and I know that it isn’t. I’ve spent so much time, so much of my life on bettering this skill, but I’m still failing. 

My boyfriend also graduated recently and got a job right after graduation. The pay is decent, but not enough to get approved for renting because the cost of living here is so high. We need to move out because his mom wants to sell the house and move to a different city, and we want to move out because we want independence and privacy.

And that’s the crux of it. I can’t find a proper job. I applied to so many, and I haven’t even gotten a single interview. Not one. I don’t have any practical experience and no connections. There’s nothing that makes me stand out from the hundreds of applicants each of these job listings gets. If my boyfriend was dating a socially competent woman with marketable skills, they would be able to afford to rent an apartment. I should break up with him, so that he can move on with his life and find someone worthy of him, but it’s too painful to do that, so here I am wishing, like the ungrateful piece of trash that I am, that the cancer comes back so I can just let it do its thing and pass with some nobility. There’s nothing left anymore. There’s no life to look forward to. I can’t get a job. I can’t earn enough money doing “freelance.” At 30, I have no skills, no soft skills, no usable experience. I am actual trash, a worthless waste of space. Every path is a dead end and a reminder of what I am. I’m so tired of feeling hopeless and worthless. I want it to end."

I keep telling myself that once I reach x milestone, my life will be amazing but I always achieve x and then it changes to something even more difficult to complete. I'm tired of hoping.

I recognize this doesn’t exactly read like some dramatic, emotional secret, but honestly? It’s starting to cause me a disproportionate amount of stress. 

I have been battling this urge off and on since I was about 8. I have no clue why. I’m not trying to look intelligent, or hipstery, or even fashionable. Frankly, I’m pretty sure my face looks better without glasses. But my internal schematic is convinced I am supposed to have them, and no amount of reasoning with myself has convinced me otherwise. 

Obviously, fake glasses are a thing, and I have plenty of them. But frankly, I don’t want to be seen by everyone as that douchebag who wears fake glasses full-time for no reason. It’s humiliating. I can only lie for so long before someone asks to try them on, or picks them up and wears them while I’m in the other room. I don’t wanna have to live some sort of weird Hannah Montana double life where nobody knows I’m essentially faking a disability, for some inscrutable psychological reason even I can’t explain. 

I can handle people judging me for pretty much anything, but being known as the “Fake Glasses Guy” is just a whole ‘nother level of lame. And thus, my lifelong struggle continues. Thank you for bearing witness to my tragic tale."

She told me she was for sure her mom was cheating on her dad. Recently, her mom withdrew most of their money from the bank account, gave it off to someone and said they’ll receive more money later leaving them with only a couple thousand. She refused to tell who she gave the money to, for sure they would get it back. Not her husband, not even her kids. My mom, sister and I suspected it. Our whole extended family is involved in this, gossiping or whatever but from what my mom heard, there were a lot of signs she cheated. Not being home on days she didn’t have work, dressing prettier, not taking the holy eucharist anymore, not telling who she gave the money up to, trashing her husband etc. My cousin texted me saying that she and her sister went through their mom’s phone. She always kept it shut which they assumed was to save battery, but they turned it on and discovered the whatsapp messages. Calling another man “Sweetheart”, “honey”, while married. Suspicious messages or whatever. She denied cheating. But her dad took her to their mantle with all the holy stuff and the cross telling her “Swear right now to the lord that you didn’t cheat on me”. She didn’t do it and kept denying I guess. My aunt is a very religious person according to my cousin and yet she would cheat. It’s one thing to cheat, but it’s another thing to take all that hard earned money and give it to a complete rando. She has some nerve to scream at my other uncle and aunt accusing them of ruining her family when she ruined it the moment she cheated and took all that money.

I wish I hadn’t been touched. I wish that I wasn’t broken. I wish that I could be a normal, not-fucked-up person and I hate that it was so easy for that to be ripped away from me. Whether I like it or not, they still have power over me. They won’t leave my mind, no matter how much I want them to disappear.

Why didn’t I fight back? Why did I freeze? Why do I still freeze and smile when men approach me with the worst of intentions? 

Why do men think it’s okay to grab my shoulder and tell me I’m perfect blowjob height? Why do men think it’s okay to coerce an 11 year old girl into taking her shirt off? Why do men think it’s okay to make me watch them jerk off to porn and compare me to the women performing for their gaze? Why do men think it’s okay to coerce me into sexual acts and threaten me with finding someone better? Why do men think it’s okay to grab my hand and trap me in a dark tiny room and reach inside me and scrape my insides out until I bleed and cry? And why did I let all of these things happen?

I don’t deserve this. And now I’m fucking ruined. I don’t like sex. I hate it. I spent an hour in the shower, scrubbing my skin with soap because I just want to be clean. I’ll never be the smiling, happy and enthusiastic girl that they expect me to be, even when I meet the person who deserves it most and would never hurt me.

Why do I have to carry this burden? This is a weight I have to carry for the rest of my life, and they’re free to walk away.

I tried to say something. I gathered the courage when another girl spoke out against him, but she laughed and said that she made it up to ruin his reputation. And now I look like a liar and an idiot. And now it’s too late because it’s been years since then.

I want to be loved but I don’t trust anyone to love me. Sex and power always come back to haunt me, but I want nothing to do with it. It’s always something I owe, and I don’t want to feel like I’m in debt to anyone. My last relationship crumbled because again, I failed to satisfy him. Years of emotional intimacy were destroyed because a few orgasms meant more to him than the special connection we shared and the memories we made. I wasn’t enough. And I hate that this even impacts my self esteem and my self worth at all. 

I don’t want to carry this anymore."

rspw43,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rspw43/turmoil_in_connecticut/,Turmoil in connecticut,1,4,1640941702.0,"Hi all, totally new here! Never posted anything before, but im at the end of my rope and was hoping for some insight.

Here goes.

My husband comes from a big European family, they are 6 boys and 1 girl. The brothers are all very loud, immature, and rambunctious. (BuIt they can do no wrong in there family’s eyes)  i have dreaded every gathering for the past 20 years! I am constantly floored by how they act and the things they say! I honestly dont know where my shy, quiet  husband comes from, but for his sake i bite my tongue and always have a smile on my face. 

One brother in particular goes out of his way to make me miserable, i have never clapped back at him in my twenty years, not when he would put his hand in my face when i would try to greet him,not when he made me cry on my wedding day because he was so upset his younger brother was getting married before him and he constantly insulted and picked on me, not even when he singles me out and picks on me for every little thing. If my child touches a toy that belongs to his kids i need to ask permission, or if its a potluck and i eat something he or his wife made its a comment about how im eating his food, (regardless that i brought a dish)  I feel awful not saying anything, but i do it because i dont want to cause turmoil. 

Hes constantly making his mother and sister cry too, and he is just always in competition with everyone. His bad mood and negative energy is palpable. He picks and chooses who he’s nice to, and its obvious. Every gathering he argues with someone, He his wife and kids need to get served at the table first, or he will have a meltdown, if his mother so much as hugs another grand kid its a twenty minute speech about how he feels mistreated. If his kids are napping its silence in the house with all lights off, but when the others are napping and his kids are up life proceeds as normal. His daughter smacked her head on the table the other day and he went ape shit and threw everything that was on the table on the floor like a child pulling a temper tantrum. Hes a tyrant, and he makes me so uncomfortable. Yet no one says anything out of fear of breaking the peace, so this maniac continues to bully everyone.

I am a new mom with a 5 month old baby girl, and went to our first gathering all together. I saw him kick the 16 year old family dog because she was in his way, yell at his mom because dinner was late, and push away his 2 year old handicapped nephew because he was not in the mood to play. As i fed my daughter pablum he proceeded to shut all the lights, since his kids were napping a whole 2 floors down. My blood was boiling but i just concentrated on my baby, the hell with him. At the table my husband told his parents that our baby doesn’t cry much, his brother then said oh really? Can i try something. So my husband made the mistake of saying yes. Doesn’t he not hold back and screech at the top of his lungs into my babies face. My baby started to cry, and i was filled with so much rage and anger that i unleashed the 7 gates of hell on him and told him everything that was on my mind. It was like an erupting volcano, and i just couldn’t help but let him know that hes the most miserable human I’ve ever met and im done with his emotional abuse. I fought for my baby above all, but then also for everyone else he bullies. My mother in law came to see me and gave me a hug, told me she wish she had my courage and that she should of been the one to tell him. I then packed up our things and left, enough is enough. I have never felt such gratification in my life! I finally did it. I stood up to my bully!

Now that a-few days have passed, my mother in law keeps calling my husband in tears begging him that i apologize to his brother for my outburst to keep the peace, because now he also isn’t talking to my in-laws because they didn’t react, and the mom gave me a hug instead of him.   His wife refuses to speak to me, i apparently really went to far and hurt his feelings, and i am-shocked that after finally defending myself i am still the bad one, my husband is adamant that i have nothing to apologize for and he is ready to just walk away from his family all-together if they cannot see that. His other family members are playing the neutral card and i cant help but feel like since im an in law I’ve already lost. I feel partially guilty, and am wondering if i should just apologize to keep the peace between brothers and parents and die a bit inside? Or do i hold my ground?"

i relapsed today, and i’m mad because it was only a few weeks. i’m not in any means at risk of suicide, but self harm is a bad habit i haven’t been able to kick for a while. shit gets so loud in my brain, and i can’t fucking breathe, and i don’t know what else to do. i had therapy yesterday. yesterday!!! and it was great, and you’d think i’d be able to keep my shit together for even twenty-four hours, but i guess not.

but then again, she also doesn’t know about my habit.

my parents don’t know. my therapist doesn’t know. if she finds out, she’ll tell my parents due to legality, and i’m scared they’ll pull me out of college. it’s the first bit of freedom i’ve had, the only bit of fresh air away from my hometown. i love my parents. dearly. but i’m scared of how angry and untrusting they’d be if they found out their daughter they’ve always been proud of hurts herself because she can’t take her heart breaking inside of her chest. 

i’m tired of disappointing my best friend. she’s been my rock for months now, and i love her beyond words, but i feel like i fail her every time i make a mistake. it’s conditioning. it’s how it’s always been with previous friendships, and yet she’s always been an outlier, and it both confuses me and makes me sad, because i feel like she could do so much better. i wanna hug her so bad, but she’s an entire continent away.

and finally, i’m tired of my sensory issues. i washed my hands six fucking times making a sandwich two days ago. SIX TIMES!!! i could feel all the food getting on my hands and ughghghgh i’m squirming just fucking thinking about it. it also took me seven hours to get up and get food today because the packaging for what i wanted was like ""no <3"" 

this week sucks. i wanna go back to college. i want people to be nice and i want covid to be over. mask up and get vaxxed if you can, please. ;—;

feeling hopeful though. i’ll do better this time."

don’t even know if i should consider her a best friend although i’d feel guilty if i were to let her go. she constantly makes snarky comments directed towards me which i don’t think she INTENDS to hurt me with but she does anyway. i think it’s a matter of her not thinking a thing through before she says it.
The other day her and another friend were with me at a store. we somehow got on the topic of chocolate and she always talks about how it makes her “breakout” (she doesn’t even have that much acne stop complaining oh my god.) and i was like i don’t really have much of an issue with acne when eating chocolate. she proceeds to say “you should stop eating it” there was this weird silence also because this was in public and not within our own pathetic little friend group. i knew others heard and it was humiliating and it made me so self conscious of my acne. i asked her why she just made that obnoxious comment and my other friend defends me saying “well you’ve just insinuated they have acne and they should get rid of” it bothered me. a lot. she then says “you know i didn’t mean it like that” no i thought you meant it like that thats why im so hurt lol.
Once again she calls me one day and we start getting on the topic of chests. now i feel uncomfortable with my chest as i am NOT cis gendered and do not normally consider myself a girl or female to say the least. talking about my chest size or my period or anything female related is very uncomfortable. i have always being insecure about my chest, boys have always called me flat even though my chest isn’t too small, it just isn’t very big either. i do have boobs i guess is what im trying to say, im not completely flat chested... my friend proceeds to tell me she “wishes she had nothing” just like me she says. almost giving me the most backhanded “compliment” of a lifetime. talking about a flat chest as if thats some sort of standard or something pft.
another situation happened back in August when me and that same other friend went to the mall. that day i had worn a kind of tight fit tank top with some tight jeans. she kept making comments about how “skinny” i was and those comments started to bother me. I have never been a skinny person although i’d never considered myself “fat”. i kept telling her im mid sized but she would literally tell me no. i get she was trying to compliment me but these comments hit close to home because i have vivid memories of struggling with my larger thighs and the meat on my stomach. it makes me unable to fit in a lot of jeans sizes and types. i remember breaking a zipper to one of my pants at age 13 and being so embarrassed to tell my mom that i’d forced those pants on so much that they literally broke. i cried for days. theres other memories that i have that i wont simply get into but being called skinny was pissing me off as i have never had the experience of a skinny girl. i feel like she looks at any person slightly smaller than her and thinks they’re skinny. i have lived with a sister that had been a size zero. trust me i have SEEN skinny. to be called that was so upsetting. not to mention that the whole mall trip she would bring it up. i did NOT appreciate the constant comments on my looks. being called skinny should not be a compliment??? thats so fatphobic.
this is very few of many. sorry this is so long but what kind of behavior does this seem like to you? very weird and subliminal."

He doesn't have a house so many friends have hosted him, and each time these friends really helped him (they gave him money, expensive gifts, materials for drawing because he's an artist, they helped him with administrative procedures...) and not only did he do nothing in return, but he also had bad habits like bad-mouthing the hosts, stealing things (involuntary or not ? idk)... My friends always told me ""do what you want, but I don't want to talk to him anymore because he is very toxic"".

When I was 15-18, I defended him like crazy. He was my saviour, and he was very depressed, so it couldn't be his fault. However, now that I am 20... I don't know who to trust anymore.

Right now, he is living with a friend and his family since 2 years, he doesn't pay any rent and doesn't help financially because of lack of money. His friend is at a drawing school, and he complained to me about it because ""I wish I was in a drawing school too, and I'm more talented than him !"". I did researches and I told him ""to enter the school, you don't need any diplomas, and the family you live in is willing to pay for the school. It would give you a diploma, you would be able to do what you have always dreamed to do, so go for it !""... guess what he told me ? ""School is not for me"". He literally said he wanted to be in school some minutes ago, and now that you have to actually work for it, he is saying it's not for him ?

He doesn't want to do any odd jobs, like working part-time, because ""it would be damaging for my mental health"". He often doesn't draw, because ""I have to be in the perfect mood to draw"" ; I told him that he can still draw doodles to practice anatomy, he refuses, and then he complains about his drawing level decreasing. He is literally gaming all day *(he doesn't want to work in the video game field)*, living in someone else's house, complaning about the people hosting him. He is literally 22-24 (don't want to give his exact age).

I have always tried to help him. If you count every gift, every event, every financial help I did to him, I gave him \~300-400 euros. I did researches about mental health, about administrative procedures, about everything he needed. But he did nothing, excepted destroying everything around him. One of his friend ghosted him for months after she hosted him. A couple who hosted him almost broke up because of him. The friend who is currently hosting him was in quite a lot of trouble some months ago because my friend revealed his relationship with a girl to his parents and grandma.

However... he told me that without me, he feels alone and empty. He saved me. At 16-17, he was my everything, and I was living for him. I don't feel this way anymore, but I'm still very attached to him... I can feel him getting on my nerves, I can see my money getting away for nothing, but... I don't think I will have the strength to abandon him."

So I've been FWB with a girl for about a year. She very quickly became one of my best friends before that. We've known each other for almost 2 years now. We hung out very often, and loved each others company. The biggest mistake I know I made was not telling her that I truly am in love with her. I know she loved me, and we've had some very emotional conversations about it in the past. She is better at expressing her feelings. The issue is that I have so much trouble expressing mine because I've never been in love with someone before her, and I also didn't know what I wanted out of the relationship we had. Being in love was just a totally new experience for me, and so I guess I am hesitant to consider the long-term. We were having sex, but we both knew we cared deeply about each other too. 

Part 2: 

I left for 4 months to work in a remote community (I am a recent university graduate gaining some work/extra-curricular experience before applying to medical school). I would tell her every now and then that I miss her, and during the first month, she also said she really, really missed me. But I heard from her less and less the following 3 months. She is not a great texter (more interactive irl). In 2 weeks, I am coming back to the city she lives in, where I normally attend university. Today though, I saw her Instagram story of her celebrating an ex-friend's birthday with him, a friend who was interested in her but whom she rejected early on because their friendship didn't work out. I used to work with the guy, and I barely know him, but I do know he was and most likely is still interested in her. My heart just shattered seeing her with him, both laughing and having a good time. I guess the whole dynamic I explained in Part 1 + me leaving for 4 months is what has left me emotionally broken now. I may be just overreacting, but I am feeling absolutely terrible."

She was born right at the start of covid and really hasn't been around enough other kids to get sick. She's cuddling with my husband who was negative but has a cough. The member of our household who traveled and is positive and quarantining feels bad, but we've also had a non-covid cough around the house for about a week. She has a mild fever and a hoarse inhale with a little whistle like croup and she's sleepy and grumpy. Emphasis on the grumpy. I listened to her lungs with the odd stethoscope our realtor gave us when I was pregnant to hear her heartbeat and she doesn't sound crispety crunchety peanut buttery so that's good. Fought me off like a little tiger as soon as she realized it was touching her but the triage nurse on the phone I called for advice for said she sounded okay at rest too.

It's confusing, I guess? On one hand everyone warns you about parenting anxieties and my god do I have anxieties to spare, but on the other I'm almost happy that it finally happened and I don't have to dread it anymore. It's scary in a way that my body instantly mutes and snaps into action about to hear her hoarse inhale, but it's also almost like a giant blister being popped. Like, the worst has happened and it's not that bad. Covid is here. It's a thing we've been able to dodge until now and all boosted and vaxxed and whatnot but the little covid is here now. And it's okay. Omicron is running through my friends, family, and socials like a really annoying cold with sweepstakes odds that it really nails you to the wall. But they're sweepstakes odds, and she's no more ill than any other toddler.

But she's my toddler.

I'm veering wildly between peaceful cleaning zen perfection, everything will work out, and, ""*oh no my man and my baby are in there coughing and I haven't heard her in a minute is she still alive*?"" and it is tedious.

Mixed emotions",1,6,1640937752.0,"I want to preface this by saying I’m on a waiting list for therapy, but it takes a couple of months in my country for a first appointment due to how crappily our government runs the health sector.

When I [26F] was around 9, my mom’s husband started molesting me. He was with my mom since I was 1 or 2 years old, so this is a guy who literally changed my diapers and watched me grow up. The abuse went on for a couple of years, but my mom was also emotionally and physically abusive so she wasn’t exactly someone I felt I could trust. Basically I didn’t tell anyone until I was 14. By that time they had already separated and were heading for divorce for other reasons, but were actually on the verge of reconciling (due to what I think is my mom’s inability to financially provide for 4 children. We went from a house to a 3 bedroom apartment with 5 people and my mom had a lot of debt). 

The opportunity to get it off my chest came up one day due to a rumor spreading around my biological dad’s side of the family that he was molesting me and my older sister [29F]. My sister asked me whether my dad had ever touched me, and I told her never, but our stepdad did. 

Just as I had always predicted, my mother handled it very poorly. As in 1) forced me to never tell another soul, 2) never put me into therapy, 3) kept in contact with my abuser and I’m pretty sure she has doubts to this day about whether I’m being truthful since he denies everything. When I told her everything, she literally asked me “are you sure you’re not just saying this because you don’t want me and (name of abuser) to get back together?” 

Looking back, she was so spineless. I remember once we were at my little brothers baseball game, and his dad came up to me and glared at me as he said something (can’t remember anymore what he said. I just remember being so scared). He stuck out his hand to give me a handshake. I just looked at my mom to help me out of this situation. I wanted her to tell him to fuck off, but she was just cowering. I ended up shaking his hand. That was the lowest I’ve ever felt in my life.  

He died a few days ago from C*vid, and I feel so relieved that I never have to see him or worry about seeing him ever again, but I’ve been crying a lot too because of how this is affecting my little sister (21F) and brother (19M). I’m very close to them and they idolize him and my sister actually LIVES (or lived) with him. They kiss the ground he walked on. He was honestly a really good dad to them, and since they were so young when the separation happened, they don’t remember how horrible he was to me and my older sister. My sister thinks we hate him because he was “mean” to us back then, and especially my little sister has tried convincing me over the years that he’s a changed man. My brother is a bit more wise and knows his dads a terrible person because he and I were questioned by the police when he was about 8 years old after we both overheard his dad beating up our mom."

This seems like such a small moment but is was salve on deep wounds. Its huge, I bought myself a new apron because I fell in love with one again. It took 9 years. In my family everyone has one particular apron. We all cook and bond over food. Its almost like eating is one of the few activities when we can all tolerate each other because when food is in our mouths we can't fuss at each other. Its a family tradition of my grandmother's. Her family gifted handmade aprons to every member at a certain point. We no longer make them, but everyone of us eventually finds an apron we love and it becomes a treasured item. I found mine when I was 20 and I loved it. 

My ex-husband knew how much it meant to me. I brought it with me half way around the world as a connection to home. He knew when he slid that blade across the fabric tearing a huge slash, he damaged more than fabric. He was drunk and chose to not hurt me physically that time but something deeper that wouldn't fade like a bruise.  I cried over that apron as I sewed the huge gash. I could never look at it the same. It was always a reminder of my poor choice in him. I let him hurt me for too long. I left, eventually. The scars of him are still around; deep in my heart and on my apron. He ruined the apron but not me. I left. I could heal and begin again. 

Its been 5 years, I'm happily engaged to a loving man who is kind and compassionate.  I still have nightmares of you far too frequently and I hate that. Probably because being with him again is my deepest fear. I'm sharing with my therapist about these feelings though, so I'll manage. I did a HUGE thing today! I fell in love with a new apron again and I bought it for myself. It has beautiful wildflowers embroidered on it. A new future is blooming for me without him. He are now a part of my past, fertilizering my bright future.  This apron is another step away from him. This apron is a token of love to myself. I will grow and flourish.  ♡

If you are experiencing domestic abuse,  physical or emotional... YOU CAN START AGAIN! You deserve more! Please reach out for help if you can't do it alone. Big changes begin with taking small steps. We all deserve a loving fulfilling life. Best wishes everyone.

I was heavily bullied as a kid, I would catch it from kids at school, older cousins and worst of all my dad all hours of the day. It got to the point where my name was a slur that everyone got in on whenever I tried to talk or ask a question in class the response was “shut up Aaaaaan” or “fuck you Aaaaan” and they all loved it (my name is Aaron). After years of stuff like this I was getting hair loss from stress and at 16 I sliced my arm up and wanted to die. My sister found me and took me to my aunts and I got temporary therapy. My grandma had died slowly in our house from a misdiagnosed Tumour a month earlier so they summed it up as that being the reason and I thought they were right. At the end of that year I was then told my dad had gotten a job in Australia and we had to move there (from New Zealand) so I left everything that a had and moved at 16. As expected my depression was at an all time high at that point. I wanted nothing more than to die. Then I met a girl who was very interested in me and could see through my bullshit to see I was super depressed. I ended up getting into a 4 and 1/2 year relationship with this girl and I loved her like crazy. We did everything together and I started to feel happy again. But when she wasn’t there it all came back and I was stuck relying on her for my happiness. So after 4 & 1/2 years I ended it because I needed to deal with my demons without putting it all on her. It’s safe to say she was devastated and pretty much hated me. I felt fucking awful so I tried to make this right and we just fought more and more. After it ended she started seeing one of my long time friends in Australia and asked me if I was ok with it. I said yes but for the sake of our friendship I don’t wanna hear gossip or drama or be anyone’s shoulder to cry on if things go bad. She flipped the fuck out about that. Said I wasn’t letting her be happy and said that she hated that I didn’t know what I wanted and made up a bunch of scenarios that supposedly happened in our relationship ( I’m talking complete fabrication, places people everything) and I’m basically the worst person alive. My friend who also has had a rough time of it in life and was present for 95% of this relationship pointed out that she was gaslighting me (never heard the term before then). I was completely mindfucked at that point because I believed everything she said. So now I’m free of that I’m what I would like to say “living lost” 
Because combining everything that’s happened I don’t love a single shred of myself. I try to go outside of my comfort zone and meet new people but I just struggle to form any connection with anything and I’m scared that eventually I won’t have an interest in anything at all and just be lost
But I’m determined to keep trying because my chances are only a definite Zero if I don’t try at all. If you read this long ass story I appreciate you and wish you all the best in life ❤️"

Now, for a bit of backstory, i used to cut myself, generally at the top of the arm kinda high of the shoulders so even a short sleeve shirt would completely cover it, i know it's stupid and i haven't done it in a few years, but i did it and i have some scars from that. 

The scars are barely visible, literally no one has ever seen them, i'm confident that not even the nurse that gave the vaccine even saw them, and she had to inject it right around where i have them. Basically, i became a little overconfident on the fact that i'm the only one to notice them because i know that they're there and, given that it's hot as f\* right now where i live i decided to were a tank top, thing that i never do because of the scars, i only have one because someone gifted it to me.

So i was talking with my friend and suddenly he kinda gets closer and look at my arm, i internally panic, with reason it seems, because he instantly put on a serious face and asked me if i was cutting myself. Obviously, i lied, try to pretend i didn't know what he was talking about and when he pointed out it seemed like i had cut marks, i just play it as nothing, i said it was maybe some cat scratches, or some other shit, said some jokes about it, etc. 

I think i convinced him, idk, i feel like i became really good at lying about these sort of things with time, but now i can't sleep, like my brain won't let it go, i was two seconds from having an anxiety attack at the moment and that feeling hasn't really died out yet. Like what the fuck i'm i supposed to do,  i don't want people to know about this, like maybe he was convinced but, what if he wasn't? What if he is still concerned? What if he shares that concern with others?  What if someone at some point hears about it and asks to see it?

I feel like screaming right now, i'm so anxious, so mad at myself and at him for noticing, and all of this shit because i decided to use a fucking tanktop, i mean i don't even like it, i just put it on because it was hot, and now it's 4 am and still can't fucking sleep. Idk what i'm going to do, i just hope this shit ended right then and there.

Sry to anyone who read this mess, i just needed to vent someway to, hopefully, feel better and, for god's sake, get some sleep."

I've handled the deaths of people I love all my life by distancing myself from the people once they get sick so it hurts less when they're gone. It helped at the time, but in hindsight I feel like such a piece of shit. One of my Great Uncles, a man who I looked up to my whole childhood until he passed, got cancer. I kept my distance, played chess with him every now and then like we used to before he got sick but not as much as before. The only real vivid memories I have of him, as a direct result of my own decisions, are of witnessing him losing his senses. All I remember is him forgetting how to play chess, I remember one time he thought he was late to some event he had scheduled back in the 80s. I remember when he died. The warm smile is gone. The love, the laugh, the joy, the jokes, they're all gone because I was too much of a coward to do the right thing while I still had the chance. Another Great Uncle of mine was basically the same story but worse. I loved that man to pieces, he was a good fucking man, but all I remember of him is him dying in the medical bed they brought to his home, I remember talking to him for a moment and telling him I love him when he was too far gone to acknowledge anyone. The big warm smile is gone, I was too scared to be with him while he still had life in him, so all I really remember of him is the death. The list goes on. I feel awful, these were damn good men, they were kind and honest and always knew how to light up a room, but I couldn't even do them the decency of remembering them at their best because I was too fucking self-centered to do the right thing and be by their sides. They deserved to be remembered better, and beyond that I cannot fucking imagine how they must have felt watching me and I'm sure many others grow more and more distant as they grew more and more vulnerable and less and less able to reach out on their own. Watching people try to move on before you're even in the grave has got to he so fucking awful, and I've done it several times to people I loved, people I cared about, because I was too damn afraid of the idea of losing them to spend the time I had with them wisely and make the time they had left in the world every bit happier that I could have made it.

I'm more worried about my clients enjoying themselves and pleasing them, than I am about self-worth. I've only spoken to a few friends about this because a lot of people in my life are very anti this sort of thing."

I can't tell them how I feel for the same reason, I feel like they will only call me sensitive or over dramatic and want to leave me. I find it so difficult talking about my problems for this reason. Because I've been told by my own mother say those things to me, because I've had my own friends brush them off and not care. If I bring my problems up again will I just be called a baby all over again? I am taking therapy but feel like I can't talk about anything because I only open up to those I know, by the time I feel comfortable with my therapist I can't talk about my problems because I built this persona with them and remotely bringing up a personal problem will only make me look like an attention seeker because I was fine for the longest time and now all of a sudden I want to die?

I got in contact again with a boy I met earlier this year but it just didn’t work at that time. When we got in contact again we started talking every day and eventually we met up. Within a few minutes it felt like we’d known each other since like forever. After that because of covid meeting up became difficult but we called as much as possible and talked 24/7. We shared feelings and really fell for each other, but again we were never able to meet up again. I was gonna move abroad for work in August and knowing that was hard for him because he really liked me. Two weeks before he had to go he went on a vacation with friends where he had really bad connection, which I did not know so I thought he was ignoring me on purpose. 

After two weeks of me leaving the country we talked again but it still wasn’t like we used to be. A month later we finally called again and he explained everything about how he did not mean to ignore me but he simply did not have service. I felt like we were back to normal again, but then came oktober.
He texted me and said he had to tell me something, he started dating someone else. I knew we weren’t really dating but we did say we would see what would happen when I came back. 
I absolutely broke me.

But a few weeks later I met a guy on Hinge. We started talking and now we’ve been dating for almost two months. He is absolutely amazing and I really fell for him.

Now a month ago the guy from back home messaged me that he was no longer dating someone and that it only lasted for a few weeks. After that we kept in contact but just briefly over Snapchat every once in a while.

Now today I talked with the guy from back home again and I told him I was dating someone and I could notice he was kinda surprised by it. And when I explained to him that I had to move on and stuff, I noticed that he thought we were still gonna try when I got back and that I was single.

And now I’m questioning everything, I mean I do love my boyfriend but I realize that I never got actual closure with the other guy, which is really messing with my head.

Is it just closure that I need (and how do I get it) or am I being unfair to my boyfriend?"

Somehow along the time I just started living in this dream that we were meant for each other. I just believed we will always be there for each other. So I left everything behind whenever he needed me. But now bit by bit after five years I realised now he has good friends, popularity in his university and a amazing bond with his family. 

But I still thought him to be my everything. So now today I am left alone while he is enjoying new year’s with his friends and family. 

I realised he has no space for me in his perfect life anymore.

Little does anyone know, I’ve been listening to heavy metal since I was in 6th grade. I had an emo/metal phase I guess and it started with Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, BMTH and then progressively got heavier into bands like Architects, Meshuggah, The Acacia Strain, Tony Tapdance Extravaganza, Knocked Loose, etc. I’ve spanned through different genres of metal music such as Thrash metal, Nu metal, Deathcore, Djent/progressive stuff. I never stopped listening to it even though I have branched to other genres of music. In highschool I would sneak out to metal concerts and would always go alone. I guarantee if anyone in my circle of friends, family, or peers listener they would think I was the antichrist. Most of my friends or people I know just listen to hip hop, EDM, indie, or mainstream music. 

I’ve noticed as I got older I have felt more distant in expressing the music I like with other people. In fact I feel distant from many people because I feel like I’m hiding a big part of who I am. I rarely have met other people who like the music I do and if I have we are polar opposites and don’t get along (I look relatively preppy and I don’t dress like a typical metal head/dress professional for flight school, church, work) I have had this one GF listen to my music on accident and had this look of sheer horror on their face of WTF and I made a quick excuse that it was an old playlist from a long time ago but I deep down I definitely still listened to it. I guess I’m still afraid of being judged by people I’ve grown close with and my extreme music tastes clashes with how others view me. How would my wife or kids see me if I was blasting Cannibal Corpse in the bedroom? It’s just hard because I’ve managed to keep up my “normal” persona (no offense to any metal heads out there) for so long. 

Anyone in similar situation or has been hiding a secret music taste, hobby, or creative outlet from other people?"

I was on his phone earlier looking for some old video of him on snapchat, so I was digging through lots of old messages and stuff to find it. Well, in this pursuit i stumbled across a bunch of pretty old romantic/somewhat sexual messages between him and a few girls that we are both friends with today. 

I understand that these were from the past and don’t really affect our relationship today. It just upsets me a bit because I have asked him about previous relationships a good few times just out of curiosity, and he told me about many of them, but never said a word about any of these relationships taking place - so these messages were just a bit jarring to find, as he goes out with these girls on his own relatively often and I never knew that they had a history like this. 

Probably overreacting since this was in the past, but this is just the first time ive ever found him lying to/keeping information from me and it hurts a bit"

I've never lied about my looks to her, but I am obese and I'm just not good looking. But I'm just so paranoid that she won't be happy with how I look and maybe not want to be friends with me anymore.

Accomplishments:
Graduated College

Got my driver's license

Attended a Yankees game

Attended a Rangers Game

Attended preseason New York 
Islanders hockey games.

Attended AHL hockey games

Attended comic cons here on the east coast 

Posted on YouTube and wrote for my blog.

Wrote for two online blog type things. 



Regrets:
Currently single

I didn't become a professional skateboarder. 15 year old me wanted to do that.

I didn't publish a book. This past year I started writing again. Some poems and I'm writing a book. I'm only like 13 pages in though. 

Didn't get a really good job. I work, but I need a better job.

I moved back home after college and I'm still here. 

I still let my childhood memories get to me sometimes. I can't help it. My Dad is mentally ill and hit me a lot. There were financial problems too. I know I'm in charge of my life now, but I can tell the abuse has affected me. 

I didn't become a professional YouTuber. I know most people won't make money on YouTube, but it would be cool. 

What about you? Anyone else leaving their 30's soon?"

I got over NYE Parties because it meant cold food and usually super drunk people whom I did not really know. I never got to celebrate NYE when I was dating my then bf (and now husband). I would usually cook for the fam for NYE. Italian fare. Maybe light a bonfire. But today, it’s a party of 1 in my balcony with starlights and fairy lights. My bottle of Riesling and some G,T and Ale (it’s a yummy cocktail I discovered recently). Hot food. Maybe some music. And a lot of feeling the feelings. If there is one thing, 1 thing that I have not done in 2021 is to really feel and check in with my own self. Not numb myself but to really feel everything. 

I recently discovered that my closest friends are close to me because they are awesome. I have put myself in a very difficult position and the people and the person whom I thought would probably kill me or judge me to death told me yesterday that she doesn’t care so long as I am happy. She has been my best friend for 25+ years and I have never opened up to her like I did in the last few weeks. I should have. Now I know better. We have unlocked a new dimension in our friendship that I did not know existed. 
So I don’t think that I need to be pitied coz I don’t have a bigger circle to party with. I think I am plain lucky to have a few friends with whom I can go just be. 

I take that feeling of complete security with me to 2022. 

When I sit tonight with my food and drinks and music, and my heartaches and heartbreaks and life lessons, I’ll be content and send out gratitude to the stars about everything. Yes, even for the broken parts of me and my life!"

I know its not my fault and I know I have good friends but I can’t shake that voice telling me it’s my fault and I’m going to die alone. Sometimes I can almost make it go away, but lately stress has been mounting and it’s been getting louder. I only post this because I can’t get it out of my head and it’s been putting terrifying thoughts in my head and I’m not always strong enough to keep from exploring those thoughts. I know everyone has problems and maybe it’s selfish of me to expect someone to give a damn about mine but I’d really like someone to tell me things are gonna be ok. I know throwing this post out into the void probably won’t provide me much relief, but at least getting this into words might help jettison these thoughts from my mind."

He's a serial cheater and I chose to forgave him all throughout our relationship thinking he would change, but he didn't. I got pregnant by him during the start of the pandemic which is March 2020. (Our baby boy is 1 year old as of the moment). Well tbh, he was a great provider. But all throughout my pregnancy, he was still cheating behind my back which lead to me almost losing our baby due to the stress he brought. 

Fast forward, yesterday he caught me exchanging flirty and dirty text messages with some dude last July and he was furious and decided to end our relationship. What was my motive? I wanted revenge. During those times that I was texting that guy, he was sleeping with multiple woman. I know that it's a dumb reason why I did that because I should've ended the relationship long ago when I was not pregnant and already saw the red flags but tbh, I didn't have the courage to do that because I loved him so much. But now that he was the one who ended our relationship, I suddenly felt a wave of relief. It's like a thorn was removed in my chest. I don't even feel gulty tbh. He was an abusive and manipulative partner and would always gaslight how I feel. I figured out this is also a good time to end things since a New Year is starting and this can be a fresh start for me of all the traumas that I got from him. (Which is still not healed until now and I would have multiple breakdowns about it everytime I remember it.) So yeah, HNY to me I guess."

She's Canadian from the great province of British Columbia who immigrated to America years ago. Blonde mature woman, fit, and single; she works as a yoga instructor, has been a CMT for a longtime, and goes boogie boarding very often. She resides in San Diego county which isn't far from where I live; I met her in person during the entire massage appointment that I asked after noticing her ad for bodyrubs and having interest in her for awhile. I'm a gymrat, and I timed it right to see her in the morning for her to fix my knots and soreness. We had a nice and adequate talk throughout the entire time and she hugged me from behind thanking me for coming after giving a patdown on my back. I thought she really liked me after all the chatting we produced; I gave her compliments, told her a bit about myself, and told her stories about other women that I've met who have experience domestic abuse during their early years of motherhood. After that, we've remained in contact through texting at least once a month, and I just texted her today asking how the holidays have been for her so far. She texted back saying the holidays have been great and hoped I've had it great as well. I told her it was ok but not as great as her's. Then she said ""Sorry to hear that""; to try to finish the conversation, I told her ""I had friends over during Christmas Eve, however"". Finally, like moments later she said ""Nice!"" and I stopped texting. 

So, I'm interested in experiencing what it's like to date an older woman especially the one I'm talking about now. I need tips about texting her, flirting with her, asking her out, hanging out with her, and maybe how I can sleep with her."

His dad is an alcoholic, mom is not in the picture. I heard them screaming at each other upstairs while I was in the bathroom downstairs, and then my bf went to his room, where we hang out. 

My bf has been through a lot of emotional and physical trauma, and has the typical tough guy survival mode thing going on. He does not like to share his feelings or show emotion. I am very the opposite. 

He knows I hide in the bathroom when I hear yelling. I walked into his room and he was sitting cross-legged on his bed, eyes watery. I crawl in next to him and put my arms around him. He apologized for me getting scared by the yelling and I said it's okay for him to let it out..
And he collapsed in my arms sobbing. We've been together two years, and I have never seen him break down like that. I was heartbroken at seeing him so defeated. He said his dad doesn't care about him and that all he wants is father-son time and that he's always been abandoned and that the argument was his fault. I just held him and let him cry and talk it out and said some encouraging words, but nothing I say can undo his pain. I can only support him and love him, but that's not enough! I wish I knew how to help him more, seeing him cry like that just made my heart sink. He's recieved nothing but abuse and abandonment and it makes me feel so helpless. 

Eventually he calmed down and walked me home in the snow, and that was peaceful. Home should be somewhere where you exhale, not hold your breath, and I wish I could give him a better one. We'll build a good life together but for now we're still a little too young. I've never posted on this sub before, but it does help to get this off my chest. I'm all cried out.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the kind support and advice! This is literally the kindest sub I've been on, all of you have been thoughtful. I only wish so many of you didn't relate to the struggles of not having someone to lean on or not feeling like you can express your emotions. You are all strong and warm hearted and this helped me feel a lot better about how I can support him. <3"

We were 14. Feeding off each other’s depression and quickly became “friends” after a few nights at a youth group hangout house…aka…good Christian teens doing pretty much everything but being supervised by a very questionable 20-something youth leader. 

I was so excited for a sleepover with my new friends after falling out with another group. Three of us hung out in her basement bedroom. We listening to music, wrote bad poetry, talked about love and sex, and lamented our terrible lives. And then a bottle of tequila and joint came out. 

I had no experience drinking or smoking at that time but hey, I was sad and wanted to have fun with my new friends. We drank and smoked and laughed and danced. It felt good.

One girl passed out in my friends bed and we weren’t ready to sleep so we took over her brothers room since he was gone for the night. We chatted into the night until we fell asleep…I thought.

At some point in the night she left. I was out cold until I felt someone on me. I barely remember. I was out of it. Awful story short, it was the brother.

The next morning I told her what I remembered. She didn’t seem shocked and the other girl laughed saying she had “had sex with him too.” No worries though folks, she offered me one of her birth control pills “just in case.”

I left and never spoke with her again. But you know who did talk to me? The brothers best friend. He found me at school to ask what I remembered and if I told anyone. I was obliterated by depression and brushed it off. I ended up trying to end my life a few months later and when that didn’t work, I moved across the country to live with my older brother. 

With the rise of social media, I found his profile one day. Which led to the sister, my “friend.” She’s a doctor. She wrote her thesis on justice after rape. She built a career on counseling victims on growing and recovering from sexual trauma.

She fed me to a wolf. She knew what he liked to do to her friends and let it happen. Yes, he’s the rapist. He’s the bad guy. But she was complicit. Is her field based on guilt or is she still a predator too? The irony kills me.

It’s been 19 years and I still hate him. But I hate her too."

As the title suggests, I've pretty much lived my whole life without even getting close to a relationship.

I think I'm a decently attractive guy. I go to the gym every other day and I even have a fucking 6-pack. I have straight A's at school, probably in the top of my university. (Not trying to brag, just telling my story bro, anyway it's useless cuz it doesn't attract girls, you can trust me). I have few friends, but they are close to me. I think I'd make a good boyfriend and I'm 100% sure I'm ready. For all of these reasons, I think I have a decent self-confidence. 

Even though I feel all the emotions I'm about to describe inside, I think I act quite ''normal'' outside because I know all these depressing thoughts, if said, are really unattractive for other people, so I just keep it hidden except for my few best friends. So even if I am in a depressed mood at school, for example, I'd just act normal.

But right now, it's just so hard to find the motivation to do anything, because I'm just overwhelmed by my emotions and can't get any work (or study) done. I have few friends, but they are close to me... or used to be close. They eventually all got girlfriends of their own (except one) and we talked less and less to each other.  Or when we got to talk, they'd talk about their girlfriend and I'd get depressed. So naturally, I just have no one to fucking vent to. I see my sibling who is 5 years younger than me who has experienced a lot of things I did not, and it fucking kills me. It makes me feel shamed, saddened and depressed and when I hangout with them, I feel almost like an alien. It's gotten to a point that it's becoming harder and harder to watch movies where there's a romance between characters because it makes me depressed. 

It's now been 2 years since I've had my first mental breakdown because of my lack of romantic life. I probably had a few dozen others since then and it keeps getting worse. In these times, I'd just stare at whatever's in front of me and start ruminating until I eventually cry and go under my blankets. Rinse and repeat. I cannot get any work done for a period between a few hours and a few days. I got lucky this year, my christmas breakdown only lasted for like a day in mid-december (last year, it lasted like 2 weeks and my parents almost prescribed me pills for depression).

I've always wanted to get married and have children of my own, and it makes me feel so afraid that I will never be able to. Every day that passes, it gets worse. Days eventually become months and months eventually become years. Time passes so fast I have to find a girlfriend quickly if I want to have children one day. I see some people of my age are in relationship that are 4-5 years old already and think of getting married while I've made 0 progress.

I've tried almost everything at this point. 1- Of course I've tried online dating, I've had a few matches, but they eventually all ghosted me when I tried to schedule something (even after weeks of texting). 2- I've tried to go to an event to meet people, no one was even close to my age. 3- I've been to almost every party my university has scheduled, talked to a few girls there, but they all have a fucking boyfriend because my school is like 75% males. 4- I've also fucking tried to text girls from my past, like from my high school etc... Also ghosted me lol. 

With everything closing again cuz of Omicron, I have no hope for the near future. 

Anyway, this is pretty much the story of my life for the past 2 years, even thought I feel really sad and depressed sometimes, a rational part of me knows that it's very unlikely I'll forever stay single, but seeing so many people be in love around me (and in the movies or the society in general) really kills me."

Sure we could stay in a secure place but we'd need food eventually which leads back to me being weak and I wouldn't be able to leave him alone because if something were to happen to me he's fucked. And if we got with a group, the group could be overrun, we could be separated, anything could happen.

And I know zombie apocalypse isn't something likely to happen but it made me realize in general how useless I am. I'm so terrified of not being able to keep him safe."

I *am* panromantic and I *am* demisexual and I *am* genderfluid and I *do* use they/them pronouns. But I shouldn't have to justify the reason why to every person I meet.

Are my pronouns not worthy of your respect unless I paint you the tale of the entirety of my gender experience? Must I recite a verse every time I wish to invoke the usage of a non-gendered term when describing myself? Must I jump through a ring of flames every time I find somebody of the same sex to be physically attractive?

It's one thing to be simply curious; I am capable of explaining why I'm comfortable with the labels I've chosen and what they mean. But my explaination shouldn't be the determining factor in whether or not you choose to grant me basic human respect; all I ask is that you call me by the pronouns that make me comfortable (the pronouns that are *already a part of your daily language.

my friend currently has omicron symptoms and could barely get a test scheduled. idk things arent getting better. we always get a little better and everyone lets their guard down and then it gets so much worse. 

yesterday my cities positivity rate was 21% and today it's 31%

we need a real, genuine lockdown. the ""first lockdown"" wasn't even a true lockdown like in other parts of the world, it was a stay at home order. most restaurants and stuff were still open and people still went to work. 

why cant we just shut down entirely for a few weeks until its better? who cares about the economy who cares about the jobs just keep us at home again until its safe... not even the CDC cares about us anymore since fauci just lowered the quarantine times because delta airlines asked him to. 

i know we all know that we're being run by corporations but does it have to be so glaringly obvious? the only thing people care about in this pandemic is capitalism, and it's failing us. everyone is focused on going back to work and I wish they weren't. i don't think America is built for something like this, because we can't just shut down. people need to go to work to get money to buy food to buy masks to get health insurance so we can;t just force everyone inside. 

nothings working man. ugh"

Where you meet the right person and you are so horribly infatuated with them that you can't even speak. Where you're in love instantly, where you feel like you can't live without them, both parties sharing that feeling.


I wasn't expecting how quiet love is. Where you slowly realise that they've filled a part of you that you didn't know was empty. The kind of love where you sit there in silence, and when you do talk, it's the easiest thing in the world. Learning about all the things they hate, watching as both of you fall into each other's lives. Where you can feel yourself falling, and although you know you could probably live without them, that it is the last thing in the world you want. Seeing how they look at you, because there's just something different about it. 


Falling in love with their laugh, their smile, the way they eat, the way they get so passionate. The way they pick you up when you're down and never make you feel bad. It's quiet. It's not in your face. It creeps up on you, quietly, even though you liked them from the first moment you met, you weren't in love. That happened when you noticed all the things about them that made them who they are. It happened when you caught them staring at you, when they treated you like the most important person in the world. It happened when they laughed at their own joke. It wasn't there and then it was. And it isn't until you're sitting with them at lunch, they're poking fun at you, and you realise how much this could destroy you that you really take a step back and think, ""I'm in love""."

Did she want to abort? Did she keep the child to keep up good appearances with her family and friends? Was she living at home? Who is my grandfather? Did she give up my mother, but try and connect with her, but couldn’t? Is she really a horrible person as my mother says she is? Does my mother not realize based on what I read on white pages that my grandmother was seventeen when she got pregnant with her? Or was she older? 

Does my mother want to avoid admitting she was a regretful child? Did she make it that her mother, was the bad guy in all of this? She gave up my mother to a family member because she wanted to live her life. Was she getting a health care aide so young? Why don’t I ever remember her having a job? I have so many questions. 

I have been wanting to ask for almost ten years. I’m afraid she will pass away before I have the guts. I don’t hate her as my mother wants me to. I don’t even hate my father. My sister does and hung up when my father called five or so years ago. 

I was no longer living at home. I have questions to ask him too. I know where I was when she told me he called. We no longer have the number he called. But I know at some point he must have found out my Facebook and blocked me. I Facebook stalked him after I was told he called. Am I supposed to hate those that didn’t want her or me and left? Am I supposed to be siding with the woman who screamed she hated how we ruined her life while also saying we gave her life meaning? Is it from the trauma she tried to pass on to me? My father only paid child support when he was forced to. I know he was a horrible person. I often want to ask did my mother expect you to step up when you clearly wouldn’t? Did she keep expecting you to change when you were the same before, I was born? I want to ask these questions to them because I don’t feel I can ever ask my mother. I find she never says her fault in telling me how much she hated my father while also saying how horrible he was before I existed. She says she hates how her grandmother was phony to us without saying maybe she was afraid to admit to her friends that she didn't her and us in her life. She wished she could have cut all contact with my mother if she could. She had a son she would love and want later on. I want to know so much."

She was a wonderful mother, gave me the best childhood I could ask for. I could tell her anything and she would always listen. She was creative, kind, generous, and understanding. She had a very unfortunate life and many terrible things happened to her. 

I am currently 31 and everything started going downhill when I was 18. For context, my parents were divorced, I lived with my mom and brother, and my mom worked full time as a teacher. It was September 2008, my brother and I had just left home to go to university.  A few weeks into school, my brother found out he was going to be deployed and so he dropped out. He moved back home with our mom and when he told her she was devastated. Shortly after that, she suffered a stroke (I think the news about my brother leaving was the straw that broke the camels back - she didn't live a healthy lifestyle, she drank energy drinks, smoked a lot, didn't exercise). My brother left to go overseas and my dad was deployed to Africa. I dropped out of school to move back home and take care of her. She was partially paralyzed on the right side of her body and suffered cognitive issues, she wasn't the same person.

I was very depressed and suffered anxiety for several years after this. When my brother returned and I felt she had a good support system, I re-applied to school and left in September 2009. Everything was going well until sometime in 2010 I found out the bank was repossessing our home. My mother moved with her family in another province while I continued on with school. We didn't have much time before the bank took the house so we lost a lot of childhood items (photos, videos, etc.). This was another hard blow to my mental health. 

I managed to graduate, despite everything that happened, with some pretty shit grades. I took a year off and decided to go back to school for an engineering degree.  I did extremely well in that degree, I loved telling my mom how well I was doing in my courses. My mom was very proud of me, she always said she was. Throughout my whole degree, everything went smoothly. We spoke on the phone everyday, for at least 30 minutes, for probably 10 years.

I graduated in 2019, and was looking for work. In December 2019, something was very off with my mom, it was like something snapped in her mind. She was paranoid, made no sense, and was having delusions of grandeur. She was taken to the hospital and admitted to the mental health ward for a few months. The doctors thought she had schizophrenia but it was later diagnosed as vascular dementia. I had to manage her money because she would go and spend all her disability in one day, she wouldn't even pay her rent or bills. She turned into a hollow shell of a person. She was mean, yelled a lot, and said things to me my old mom would never say. She actually told me once that she was going to kill herself and say it was my fault because I wouldn't give her more money. She said so many more mean things I can't even write them. This went on for about 2 years.

On November 2nd, 2021, I got a phone call from my aunt saying my mom's house caught fire and she was injured. They think she fell asleep with a cigarette at 10AM. The doctors initially said the burns were not that bad, 1st and 2nd degree on 30% of her body. She could probably recover. She was put in a medically induced coma. On the 2nd week, she took a turn for the worse. Her kidneys were failing because she had a embolism in her colon and the doctors had to remove her entire colon so she would have a stoma for the rest of her life. My brother and I immediately went to see her. Hoping she might wake up while we were there. 

When I saw her, all I could do was squeeze my brothers hand so tight and cry. Her face was completely burned (2nd degree), her head was shaved, she was entirely wrapped up in bandages with 3rd degree burns all over her body, and was intubated.  Her fingers were black. There was only one pinkie that was perfect. I just held it and cried. Were went to see her everyday for a week. It was nice spending time with my brother, I hadn't spent time with him, just the two of us, in years. My mom would have been happy if she could have seen us. 

At the end of the week, before we were going to leave, the doctor wanted to meet with us. She told us that my moms burns were worse than they thought, she had a 50/50 chance of surviving but her quality of life would be terrible. Her mental health would be worse, she would have bad facial scars, would need years of physio, she would need personal care, and would have a stoma for the rest of her life. 

We both ultimately decided that it would be better to take her off of life support. The doctor said for what its worth, she thought we were making the right decision. I think about when I said goodbye a lot, kissing her head and telling her how much I love her. It was just weird saying goodbye to a lifeless body who looked nothing like my mom but I knew it was my mom. Taking her off life support was the hardest decision I have ever made. I don't even know how to feel about it now except that her suffering is over. I don't want to remember her as the bitter, mean person she was at the end. I want to remember her as she was before all of that.

I'm not depressed or anxious, I just think I'm grieving. We lost all of her belongings in the fire and I am still trying to settle her estate, she had no insurance or will. I can't sleep well at all, I used to sleep 8 hrs easy a night. Now, I am sleeping 4-6 hrs waking up every 2 hours. I have horrible nightmares of holding my dead mother. I also dream about the smells in our old house, about feelings coming home from hanging out with friends and being welcomed by her beautiful smile. Just an overwhelming feeling comfort that I now only feel in my dreams.

She was the best mom I could have ever asked for. I love you to the moon and back."

I think friend is about to be dumped over the fucking phone over some family-related bullshit that I still don’t know how it’s all connected. 

Said friend told me earlier today how a family matter escalated into a pretty fucked up threat from one of their grandparents and they didn’t feel comfortable coming home after their shift. I don’t blame them. The situation they described seems like it could’ve been solved if everyone in their household wasn’t being an insane weirdo. Nobody is on my friend’s side rn even if the situation isn’t so cut-and-dry, but I wasn’t going to flat out abandon them. So I said “yeah, come on over and crash on the couch for the night” and they showed up so exhausted and defeated, I didn’t know what to do except try and be calm about it. Then their partner calls to yell at them because they *somehow* got roped into this??? I left the room to give friend some space, and it’s been over 20 minutes. 

They’re both still on the phone and I’m having a huge spike of anxiety thinking about what they could be saying to each other rn. Friend’s partner sounded fucking pissed, which floored me, because it’s a total 180 from how I’ve seen them previously. Were they having issues beforehand? They must have been, because this sort of shit doesn’t just spring up out of nowhere. They both seemed so happy and perfect, so I have to wonder wtf was going on behind closed doors.

I’m so worried for my friend. They’ve been struggling with mental health related issues and toxic behavior from family members for years. And all this shit happening at once is gonna fuck them up. I’m too afraid to send them home. They insisted they’ll leave in the morning so they won’t be a bother, but I’m so afraid of the fallout they’ll be deaing with when they actually get home."

I say “well we don’t have to take my car, you could drive” and I get “well I’m just picking” I felt like that was a hint that I didn’t like it, but she just kept trucking along, pulling more and more stuff out of my backseat and putting it in a garbage bag, saying how nasty it is. 

Finally I just put the car in gear and started driving and didn’t respond when she said “wow I’m such a good friend, I’m helping you!”

Now, I will say, my car is disgusting. I know that. BUT I had it so my dog could get in it and if need be someone could get in the backseat. Now there is garbage everywhere because she pulled it all out and left in on the seat. Which is not helpful at all actually. 

I KNOW that I need to clean it out, it’s really embarrassing. I don’t need you to tell me how gross it is, it’s just really difficult for me to remember the mess is there when I have time to clean it, I don’t know how to explain. 

She did the same thing to me a few weeks ago, except that time it was pulling everything out from under my bed. I had just worked for HOURS to clean my room, and she yanked everything out from under my bed and left it in a huge pile on my floor, saying how nasty it was the entire time.

If you feel If i'm just bitter due to my dismissal please call me out on it as I need a wake up call.

Over the fall semester I was a police recruit at a Community Colleges Police Academy in a midwestern liberal city. I have always wanted to be a police officer, and I felt like I could help kickstart a change of new wave cops. I am passionate about community oriented policing, making connections with the youth in policing, and changing lives on a individual level. I knew police academy would be mentally and physically challenging, but boy oh boy does policing need to change.

Instructors taught us to view citizens as enemy combatants, and told us we needed a warrior mindest and that we were going into battle everyday. It felt like i was joining a cult. Instructors told us supporting our fellow police officers were more important than serving citizens. Instructors told us that we were joining a big bad gang of police officers and that protecting the thin blue line was sacred. Instructors told us George Floyd wasn't a problem and was just one bad officer. I tried to push back on some of these ideas and posed to an instructor that 4 other officers watched chauvin pin floyd to the ground and did nothing, and perhaps they did nothing because they were trained in academy to never speak agaisnt a senior officer. I was told to ""shut my fucking face, and that i had no idea what i was talking about.

Sadly, Instructors on several occasions, and most shockingly in the first week asked every person who supported Black Lives Matter to raise their hands.  I and about a third of the class did.  They told us that we should seriously consider not being police officers if we supported anti cop organizations.  They told us BLM was a terrible organization and to get out if we supported them.  Instructors repeatedly made anti lgbt comments and transphobic comments.

Admittedly I was the most progressive and put a target on my back for challenging instructor viewpoints. This got me disciplined, yelled at, and made me not want to be a cop. We had very little training on de-escalation and community policing. We had no diversity or ethics training.

Despite all this I made it to the final day. I thought if I could just get through this I could get hired and make a difference in the community as a cop and not be subject to academy paramilitary crap. The police academy dismissed me on the final day because I failed a PT test that I had passed multiple times easily in the academy leading up to this day. I asked why I failed and they said my push up form was bad and they were being more strict know it was the final. I responded saying if you counted my pushups in the entrance and midterm tests than they should count now. I was dismissed on the final day of police academy and have to take a whole academy over again. I have no plan to retake the whole academy and I feel like quality police officers are dismissed because they dont fit the instructors cookie cutter image of a warrior police officer and the instructors can get rid of them with saying their form doesn't count on a subjective sit up or push up test. I was beyond tears and bitterly disappointed. Maybe policing is just that fucked in america."

I was thrilled, I’ve never been with an older woman before, I’ve only ever “hooked up” twice in my life, both recently. One girl was the same age as me and one was 20, it wasn’t bad. 

Anyway

We planned on hooking up this day, on my way to her apartment I get this text.  

“Bad news, I couldn’t find a babysitter, so we’ll have to go in the other room while my kid eat’s dinner.”

I was very confused as to why she couldn’t just put her kid to sleep first, (or even reschedule..)I asked why and she said she want’s to go to sleep with her kid afterwards, and she’ll be too tired after putting her to sleep. This whole situation kind of weirded me out, but I’m young. And horny. so I just tagged along. She puts on youtube for her kid and gives them dinner, chicken nuggets and steamed veggies. 

She then took me into another room and started stroking me off. We made out for a bit, I pulled her panties down and before I knew it, we were fucking. I was going at it for about one or two minutes before she started shaking and moaning. she IMMEDIATELY came. I was very thrown off by this, but I kept going. She then asked me to stop bc she was done, pulled up her pants, told me I was the best she ever had, but she needs to put her kid to sleep. 

I was still horny however, I asked if I can just stay a little longer until her kids asleep, and that we could continue after, but she told me she has to work in the morning. I practically started begging her to let me finish, but her kid heard me and started crying. She kicked me out, dick still hard, and I had to drive home. I was so horny on the way home, everytime I drove past a woman, I envisioned myself fucking them. As soon as I got home, I begged her for nudes. She sent me a picture of her tits and I masturbated to it, and that was that. but I can’t help to feel like I’ve been used."

When I was younger my mom was very emotionally abusive I was suicidal since before I was 10. My brother was the only one I had who didn’t abandon me… until he did. I looked up to him and wanted to spend time with him so much with my repressed memories of abuse he was my hero. All he had to do was exist. He would black mail me after catching my watching porn to do things for him. Still he was my only hero. Then he left me to go be with his neglectful biological mom. I was probably around 9-10 myself then. But I’m 16 now and the last time I can remember a good memory with my brother is when he took me and my younger sister for icecream once and when he hugged me when my grandma was in the hospital dying.

I looked pretty good at the start of 28 years old. But nine months of a knee injury after a mountain bike accident, two surgeries, and a brain that craves sugar and comfort food mean I've gained about 20 kilos.

My butt has ballooned, my thighs now wobble, and my tummy has a distinct roll just above my waist band. I'm quite uncomfortable in my skin, and to make matters worse, I'm mere weeks out of my second surgery and cannot do real exercise as yet. Then I suddenly thought of swimming.

I used to love swimming as a kid. Did laps and laps and laps, every summer. It won't put weight on my knee, or bend it funny, it'll encourage the correct movement and swimming is fantastic exercise! It's a double win!

But.

If I don’t feel comfortable in my skin, you can bet I don't want to be seen in a swimsuit. I've already bought a one piece and scrapped my bikini. I'm sure older people won't be judgy, and the squad swimmers will hopefully be distracted doing their endless laps. But it's school holidays and teenagers flock to swimming pools. I've been putting off going all day because I'm scared of judgy teenagers mocking me for my rolly tummy and wobbly thighs.

I know I only gained weight because of the injury, but the weight is still there and this might be the only way to lose it.

How am I meant to gather up the self confidence to limp my way into that pool and swim, when I can't even look in a mirror at myself?"

In March 2018, I found this show on Netflix and fell in love with it after a few episodes.  It instantly became my new favorite show of all time.  Things were so great that I wanted to meet the cast at a convention so I looked up the nearest one near me and there was one in Boston called Conageddon 2 and I immediately got excited that when March 2019 hit, I went and I met 4 cast members (Eliza Taylor, Bob Morley, Chelsey Reist and Tasya Teles)  The latter 3 were nice.  I had a great time and decided to go the following year in April 2020.  I mean nothing can go wrong, right?

WRONG!!!

That's when COVID hit, causing Conageddon 3 to get postponed to later dates.  I was so angry because I was 3 weeks away from the convention happening when COVID began.  My entitled parents also cannot understand the different between the words ""cancel"" and ""postpone"".  I kept dwelling onto it to the point where the following happened:

1.  Fans kept praising season 3.

2.  I was so tired of waiting for Conageddon 3.

So what did I do you may ask?  Well I asked for a full $944 refund of the convention because I had grown to hate The 100 with a burning passion."

rskbdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rskbdn/it_is_so_frustrating_to_see_people_go_to_extreme/,It is so frustrating to see people go to extreme ends of specific arguments. It often can completely destroy any merit you have. And sometimes I can tell it's just the strong emotion behind it combined with or just the inability to properly articulate the point.,1,0,1640921505.0,"Of course I've done this, too. But there are some core beliefs of mine that I often see represented here and there by people who are still far too emotionally charged. Again, I've certainly done this. It's just frustrating because it feels that much more difficult for me to go about explaining my own beliefs wondering and sometimes knowing that people have had encounters with others who believe the same things I do but presented it incredibly poorly. It puts a bad taste in their mouth. 

But everything is about balance. There are ALWAYS exceptions to the rule, and the grey area matters and should be considered. Preaching absolutes and painting broad brushstrokes will always create more problems and cause more polarity between groups of people. You create strict sides that people have to choose, for fear of being out-casted by both groups. There has to be communication. Empathy must exist. 

I also wish people would admit when they can identify a problem and are trying to raise awareness but don't have a solution. Because patching together solutions that others can easily pick apart also diminishes merit. One thing I try to explain to people is that none of my opinions say anything about how I think government should work. I have no idea how to implement certain things I believe, and really I'm not asking or wanting anything to be *implemented.* What I want is *education*. I want things to be considered by everyone who does have the power to create structure to society. And for issues that have no business being touched by government, if the general population bothered to think about certain things I bet the world would be a better place. 

I'm sure this sounds self-righteous. Like I consider myself to be the one with the ultimate authority on certain doctrines. I don't. I know very little about this world. I do have strong convictions based on my own experience and what I feel is my ability to have empathy and at least consider what situations that are completely alien to me might feel like. And I don't just make up those feelings, I listen to those who've gone through certain experiences first hand. 

I don't claim to know everything, but I think everyone thinks they're right, no? I'm sure I have beliefs that will change down the line. There are a few that I strongly feel won't, though. And I'm sure there are issues that I am still to emotionally charged to argue about even now. But I will do my best to try to get people to look at what I feel to be truths. 

It's not like I'm going around advocating for ideals that I think are particularly revolutionary or that I take credit for. It's just stuff that a lot of people may know, but nowhere near enough. I also don't argue anything I'm not educated enough about. Hence my lack of stance on politics. Not everyone can save everything. 

I also know this will probably cross the paths of nihilists, and all I can say is I don't think I can make a difference on a wide scale. At least I don't know. I can only hope to, and I'm not trying to be Jesus or anything like that. The only thing I want out of life is to make people truly happy and healthy, even if they have no clue who I am and even if it's just a small group. I enjoy and have been helped by hearing others perspectives, and I know that I have helped a handful in sharing mine."

(Proofreading it now, and it is indeed too long. Sorry about that; I’m absolute garbage at being concise.)

Over a month ago I had a sexual encounter that didn’t go according to plan, or the standards I had set for months prior, despite my attempts to communicate. The other person is one of the nicest people I know, partially due to a mild social disability that sort of causes them to only see the world from their (innocent) perspective. That obviously has its downsides too regarding comprehension and accidental self-centeredness. 

They meant no harm, but voicing my boundaries was like talking to an aroused brick will. I was almost completely ignored, didn’t feel considered for a second, and felt rushed to do more than I wanted to because they kept asking regardless of how direct I was. I had to have declined a certain sex act probably around 10 times for the hour I was at his place, not to mention all the times I said not to expect that prior. 

My whole thing with this arrangement was to take my time and not rush (like I felt the need to do in all of my other past experiences) so I could finally relax, be in the moment, and feel like an actual participant. I thought they’d be more respectful of what I was saying in person than over messaging. It was their first sexual experience so they weren’t really thinking straight due to excitement. 

Ever since that happened, I’ve been almost unable to be happy. Ill randomly start crying whenever I think about it, and I still am not sure how I want to proceed with this situation (I haven’t seen them since). I really don’t want to meet up with them again, but I feel guilty at the idea of not giving them another chance and outright placing the ultimatum of ‘this changes or I’m out’. I know he didn’t mean any harm by it so I struggle to treat the situation as if he *did*. I have to face this at some point and I’m fucking terrified. Not of him or anything, just the situation in general. 

It’s been weighing on me every day. It feels exactly like a depressive episode (which I’ve only had a couple times prior in my life, but they’re *quite* bad and hard to get out of when they do happen). In a way, my brain can’t seem to process that either the other person or myself had the encounter. When I remember the event, my chest noticeably hurts, and it feels like I, the person who I am right now, wasn’t there, and it’s like I’m watching myself do that from a window. I can’t connect the person to what happened either. Not because “they changed in that moment” or something, I just simply can’t feel like he, as he was before and is right now, was there. 

It’s all so strange and I can’t seem to shake the negative feelings off. I feel like such a dramatic douchebag for reacting to a(n albeit shitty) miscommunication as if it were done with malicious intent. I wasn’t forced to do anything, nor was I guilted. But it’s so unfortunate. Just, the one time I spoke up and tried to create an environment where I could finally relax, it completely failed and I was pretty much only there to do him a service and leave. I doubt he knows he did that though, however I could *not* have made my expectations more clear. I explained how nervous this stuff made me both prior and in the moment. I didn’t even realize I was shaking until they commented on it, but they still didn’t pump the breaks even slightly. 

If anything I wish things were more clear cut and bad-intentioned so I’d at least have an excuse to feel this horrible about it. Instead it’s this lukewarm bullshit that’s seemingly hurt me. I hope this…emptiness (for lack of a better term) goes away soon. I’d like to be able to function again, as I have a life to live. I hate sounding melodramatic or self-pitying, so apologies if do. There’s a lot more context I can’t bother to type out - this post is already far too long

My best friend had three kids. I was there for all of her pregnancies, and I'd spend a lot of time with them all before they passed away. The longest I had watched her kids alone was 30 minutes, so I never had to help with diapers. Just keeping them safe and away from hazards.. the kids were 3, 2, & 1 when they passed.

And I've recently reconnected with an old friend who has a 2 year old. She trusts me with her kid whom I adore, and I've watched him for at most 2 hours when she was desperate for a babysitter. Nbd, I kept an eye on him to make sure he didn't climb on anything, played with him, watched The Lorax movie that I gave commentary on (lol), and gave him juice when he was thirsty. Thankfully he didn't need his diaper changed!!...

But what if it happens in the future? What if he dirties his diaper and I don't notice? What if I change his diaper, can't control him, and he makes a huge mess?

Idek how I'd deal"

That's why I try to be the most emphatic I can be especially towards children, but the fact that I'm starting to lose that empathy is what's scaring me. For example my younger cousin is in middle school which is an awkward and awful stage for any child. He's been trying to imitate older people such as high schoolers as a way to seem cooler to his friends and it's starting to piss me off. I just want to tell him to stop faking a persona and be the happy and fun person he used to be, but sometimes after I think that I start to remember that I used be the same  person as him. I also faked a persona back then and did whatever I could to gain the approval of my peers even at the expense of my own happiness. I think that the fact that I'm letting this frustrate me so much is a sign that I'm losing that empathy I once had for children."

But I get extremely peeved about my older brother. My mom is always nagging me and pressuring me into hanging out with him to “help him” because he is suffering from addiction. I want to help him but not by being around him out of straight pity.

 But that's not the point of this post. That brother has done some pretty traumatic things to me. When I was younger, about 12, he ripped the blanket off of me in my room even as I was begging him to stop because I was not fully clothed under my blanket. We have a 10 year age difference, if that helps for context. Another time, he saw me wearing my comfy cotton shorts because it was hot and he said “those are so short! You shouldn’t be wearing those” so yeah I don’t wear any type of shorts in the house anymore because I don't like being aware that my older brothers are looking at my ass. I feel so uncomfortable being alone with him, its the one thing I HEAVILY avoid. 

 Another time, we went out to dinner where our sister works and I wanted to go home because I was getting anxiety but then we spent another two hours out because he ordered two more beers after I asked him to leave. 
 Oh yeah, and when I was three him and my other older brother showed me pornography while babysitting me which gave me many MANY mental issues growing up. 

 So what do you guys think, am I being unreasonable to not want to be around him? Does it make sense for me to avoid him? I'm just getting tired of my mom dismissing my feelings every time he asks to hang out I say no and she gets upset at me. I've literally told her what they did to me growing up and she still thinks I'm obligated to sit with him to watch a movie or go to dinner with him when he asks regardless of how I feel all because he is suffering from addiction while when I had major depression for years on end she didn't give a rats shit about me. 

 note: I still talk to him and stuff, I just never want to be alone with him anymore because of how insanely uncomfortable I feel around him. There have been times where I'm sitting down on the couch and he asks me to sit closer to him for some reason, which further makes me feel uncomfortable."

In April my girlfriend broke up with me, then got with my best friend a month later after taking him to prom.

Nobody told me anything and I only discovered it because of social media.

I spent over half a year trying to move past it, but things got worse when one of my grandfathers passed away in August. One of the only things I have left of his memory is his old truck, which I try my best to take care of and I cherish it.

Three months later, my only remaining grandfather passed away in the hospital. Today was the funeral service and I can't help but feel somber.

On the 25th, we went to celebrate dinner with my mother's side of the family and my aunt picked a fight, and a fight she got. I walked out of the house moments earlier because I needed fresh air, but a little after came the yelling from inside, and when I stepped foot in that house an hour later it wss clear that a fight had broken out.

I cried for most of the ride back home.

I'm so sick of having to deal with loss and trauma; this year, without a doubt, has been the worst year of my life; everything's been the same bitter taste for the most part.

I'm continually torn because all of my friends and family are super busy, yet I really want someone to hang out with; I'd like to have a girlfriend but I don't know if I'm okay enough to be in a relationship after what's been happening. I'd love to believe I can be but I'm afraid of putting pressure on a significant other because I'm having mental health issues; I never want to do that.

Even if I were ready for a relationship with certainty, everybody's either taken or has no interest, which I guess only makes the loneliness feel that much worse. I want to hope that if it were to happen I'd feel more optimistic or feel less exhausted, but there isn't a guarantee.

I am mentally tired, I am uncertain about many things including next year, and I feel lonely.

I don't have many more words to say; I've just really lost any idea of how to express what I'm feeling."

rsj2xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rsj2xx/after_reading_a_comic_about_selflove_i_realized/,"After reading a comic about self-love, I realized that I am beautiful in my eyes",3,1,1640917720.0,"I’ve always struggled with my self-image. Whether it’d pertain to my gender, weight, or even usefulness, I never felt enough. I felt that I should always try to contribute more to others than myself. I counted my own self-worth by how others see me. I would place so much emphasis on how I should look for others, how I should act for others that I never found myself important. When people would say how gorda (fat or big) I am and how I am eating too much, I laugh and agree with them. Hell, when someone would say something so heartless right to my face, I’d add to that, basically hurting myself more. I felt the need to please others instead of being assertive and being an advocate for myself. Being a woman doesn’t help. Some of the people I interacted with felt the need to say that I would be prettier and attractive if I would put more ""effort"".

Though there are many supportive people in my life that have told me the opposite of the mean comments, I never saw that for myself. I would think they just said that to ease the uncomfortable atmosphere.

In my mind, if my attractiveness didn’t make the cut, then I would have to rely on my brains. But even in that aspect, I lacked confidence and worth.

But, after taking time to myself and reading an interesting comic about self-love, I suddenly realized that we don’t have to place so much value on if we’re beautiful or not. If you think you’re beautiful, that’s amazing! If you think that you’re ugly, that’s totally okay! The most important thing is to know that you are own the right to self-respect and self-advocation.

In my case, I know I'm going to have days where I lack everything I see in myself but accepting who I am at this very moment and seeing the beauty that I carry as a human being can be a good memory to remind myself of. 

I was just going through the motions before today but, right now, I feel really happy and at peace with everything I am."
rsj2x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rsj2x1/weird_abuse_by_mum/,Weird Abuse by Mum,2,4,1640917718.0,"28 (M), I'm not even sure if this constitutes abuse, if so it is probably the weirdest abuse imaginable.

From the age of 3 years old my mum used to pick at my skin for about an hour a day, as if I had acne. She would put my head on her lap and just pretend I had spots that she had to pick, usually she would pull the car over, find somewhere with good natural lighting and go to town on my face. I didn't see my dad much and my mum had cut ties with the rest of the family so no one else knew. It didn't take long for there to be psychological implications as a result of this. By about the age of 7/8 I started skiving school and not wanting to leave the house because I had all these marks on my face and people would make fun of me because of this. I remember people would call me 'spotted dick'. The marks were due to my mum's picking and not any actual acne. When this happened my mum started putting makeup on my face to cover up the marks so that I would leave the house. It helped for a little while but then I was embarrassed that I still had all these marks on my face and that I was wearing makeup. At this age I probably started skiving about 40 days a year of school. I was constantly worried that people were looking at my skin. I shied away from many activities like I didn't like going swimming, I avoided talking to girls and I tried to use my hair to cover my face.

Going into my teenage years my mum had stopped picking at my skin as much but now I was doing it to myself. I was spending 1-2 hours a day just messing with my skin and I continued with the same behaviours of skiving school, wearing makeup and avoiding situations. I did actually start to have some acne during this time but not that bad and a lot of my friends got it worse.

I got good grades somehow and ended up getting accepted to a good uni. I dropped out of uni within a few weeks because I was so self conscious about my skin. I ended up returning home and became suicidal. I didn't leave the house for an entire year apart from to go to a dermatologist to go on accutane. I ended up going on accutane 3 times so that I could get perfect skin.

My skin is fine now but I've been suicidal for the last 10 years as a result of the social isolation with a whole myriad of mental health problems which I have been trying to deal with.

I wonder how different my life would have been if my mum hadn't done this to me. Literally the entirety of my life has revolved around my skin for as long as I remember. I don't have any memories where I am not either self conscious about my skin or suicidal. It is such a random thing to do your son and I don't know why she did it. I've asked her and she just says she's sorry and she doesn't know why she did it. Anyway thanks for reading.

TLDR: Mum picked at my skin, changed the direction of my life."

I know this sounds silly and stupid but I've come to this realization today and I need to write it out.

When I was younger, my reading habits were exactly how most bookworms describe themselves. I devoured books, I adored them. I loved reading horror, fantasy, mystery, thriller, anything I could get my hands on (even if it was technically age appropriate). My parents didn't mind one bit, and the majority of my gifts for birthdays and Christmas were books. I was the definition of yhe socially awkward bookworm who would rather read books than do anything else.

Then, I got my first phone.
Over the years, I'll admit I grew dependent on the use of my phone for entertainment, especially especially I found YouTube. I found videos to be another way for me to find out about new things to be interested in, and especially helped curate my interest in video games. Slowly, over time, I stopped reading as often and used technology to entertain myself more often than books. When my parents noticed this, my dad wasnt great about it.. Of course, I will admit that for years I did have a strong dependency on the Internet (especially as a young tween with depression and anxiety), but in later years I tried to get back into reading again. Whenever my dad saw me reading, or if I told him about a book I was reading or information I learned from a book, he would say ""Oh wow, you're reading?"" or ""I haven't seen you read a book in so long."" He's never been great at showing his emotions and communicating in a great way where he tells you what he actually means, but these remarks always sounded so fucking mean. I felt like I was stupid, and I immediately no longer wanted to read the book and wanted to go back to my room and be alone. 

In high-school, I tried to cope with this by joking to my friends that I was illiterate. Obviously I wasn't, especially since I was actively involved in a creative writing club, and my friends knew this. The joke was funny at first, but soon it felt as if my friends began to take it to far and I was labeled as the stupid one of the group, especially considering I was the lowest grade and performance wise in school. I should have said something, and I should have shut it down when I realized that though my friends meant well that the joke made me feel even worse about myself, but I didn't.

Now I'm going into my second semester of college, and I've been given books to read to help with projects I'm doing throughout the semester. With this, I'm now realizing that I'm not over what happened. I'm terrified of reading in front of people because I'm terrified they're going to mock my intelligence. I'm so scared that the minute someone sees me reading they're going to think I'm just trying to seem smart. I got diagnosed with ADHD recently, and the struggles of focusing/needing to reread in order to absorb information + the fear of being mocked for being so fucking stupid literally makes me refuse to read in front of people. I can't read in front of people at all, even if they're strangers in the library. I can't read in front of my friends, my parents, family, etc. When I do try to read in front, I'm so scared of someone making those mocking remarks that I can't focus, which just makes me even more frustrated. 

I'm tired of being stupid. I'm tired of being scared of something so silly. I thought I was fine, I thought I was mature enough to simply get back into reading through putting my phone away, but its so much more than that. I want to read, I want to learn, I want to devour books like I used to. But I'm so, so scared of being stupid."

And now I get into one of the most prestigious unis in the UK by barely scraping the entry requirements and suddenly everyone is doing better than me, socially, academically, financially. To put into context my first lab session at uni (On a sports science course) I was paired with a nice, smart girl who got 4 A*s at A level who did my lab calculations for me because I couldn’t even remember what mean median and mode were AT UNI.

This spring boarded me into thinking all my life I was in fact the worst at everything. I stopped eating, 1 meal a day or less, I stopped going outside, I stopped going to lectures because it only confirmed I am useless because I didn’t know a damn thing, and spent half the semester in a hospital.

This means I have had to say goodbye to my son. He has to stay here with his mother (my ex) and I will get to see him for 3-months of the year.

Because he was born after the end of the transition period, my son does not qualify as a link to allow me to live here.

I can't tell my friends, though. Even though I am here crying my eyes out almost constantly for the last 2 weeks, I haven't told a single friend I am leaving.

My son obviously doesn't understand that I am leaving. My friends would, and it would completely devastate them.

I need to let it all out.,1,1,1640916102.0,"It's currently 5:30 am on december 31st. All I can think about now is how horrible this year has been for me. Most notably, the worst part out of all of it is the end of my relationship, which burned off slowly over months starting april...
on april 1st of this year i decided to prank my ex partner over the phone while hanging out with a friend i have thankfully cut all ties with. i was giggling and smiling at my phone until i looked up and saw my ex friend staring at me like i killed somebody. i asked him what was wrong and for the next 2 hours, he would unknowingly ruin the rest of my year with just a conversation about how my relationship is obsolete. in fact, how all relationships are obsolete. he asked me if i actually think my relationship is going to work, and saying stuff like ""what if you guys fall in love with different people?"", ""what if you guys ending up moving to different countries?"", ""what about 5 years from now? have you thought about that?"". i am just 19 years old and that future is far far away from me for now. and so the relationship anxiety started. i began to feel like i was starting to lose feelings for my partner, feeling the highest level of anxiety when being around him instead of the comfort and warmth i felt for over a year back when i would be with him. my life began to fall apart. i grew to have commitment issues. i would break up three times with my partner and (regrettably) i wouldn't talk about my commitment issues and relationship anxiety with him except for the times we would break up. i would always hold it in, and the worst part is that i didn't know what i was going through when i went through it all. from how i would describe it to my friends, they kept thinking i was losing feelings for him and that's what i though too. boy was i wrong. up till now i am still so deeply in love with him, but that doesn't mean i no longer have commitment issues and relationship anxiety. it is so painful to know you love somebody but to not be able to be with them because the only thing standing in between you and a healthy relationship is your own mind.
after 3 months of the last break up, early december, i had a conversation with my friend about her own relationship and the problems they've been experiencing. she told me that it's obvious they're both leaving the honeymoon phase and that everything feels different. towards the end of the conversation, a thought came to my mind: ""this is oddly alike to my last relationship."" and that's when it hit me. i realized that i never fell out of love with him. here's what was truly going on:
1)commitment issues. obviously.
2)i think i left the honeymoon phase as this was my first long relationship and i have never experienced something like this before. i've always been the kind of person to be madly in love and infatuated with the other person 24/7.. but for the first time in my life i felt ""meh"" while also being in love after months of feeling like i was on top of the world.
3)relationship anxiety. god is it painful. the constant back and forth thoughts. and this may be immature to say, but my ex friend really did this to me... it all started from there, and i took everything he said and i ran with it. now look where it got me.
4)i kept it all inside me. i would talk to my friends and therapist about it but not him. i was afraid to hurt him. but now i know that that wouldn't have been the case. i regret not opening up to him every single damn day.

so. three days after the conversation of my friend (aka where i had the realization after months that i never fell out of love with him) he told me he's in love with someone else. my heart broke. i don't really have anything to say after this tbh. i told him i still love him the next day after an argument we had online and asked if we could meet irl after i was done with my final exams so that i can talk to him with a clear head and cut our communication forever. he agreed and we didn't speak for almost 20 days before finally meeting up. he told me that she is now his girlfriend and that they always go to the bar we discovered together... and where i work now (hopefully i never see them or serve them lol). but anyways, i told him everything. i told him everything i couldn't tell him for months. this time i didn't miss out on any details. and that was it. it's all over. if anyone is going through something similar: TALK TO YOUR PARTNER PLS TRUST ME YOU TWO CAN FIGURE SOMETHING OUT IF U HAVE GOOD COMMUNICATION. DON'T MESS UP LIKE I DID!!
what sucks is remembering the beuatiful new years we spent together last year. this year he'll be with her. i'll be bar hopping with my friends trying to forget him, devising a plan for 2022 in which i don't get into ANY relationship because now i'm far too broken to be in anything commitment related, especially a relationship. 
happy new years guys, may the universe be merciful on all of us in 2022."

Life hasn't really been tough on me, I have a good relationship with my family, I have friends, to boil it down, I have an average life. Yet still for a long time I've been so depressed, and I feel so damn helpless...
I had my first relationship at the end of 2019, ended a month after too.
I felt even more miserable after it had ended, so I took the first step, I sought help.
I told my parents about how I had felt for so many years and I told my mom about a near-suicide attempt I'd had.
Afterwards I went to a psychiatrist, who after a couple of weeks, ended up giving me an OCD and a depression diagnosis, with their theory being that the depression was caused by a couple of years of undiagnosed OCD.
So, I had CBT done for my OCD, and it helped a lot, but only against my OCD.


My depression has progressively gotten worse, and it sucks.
Suicidal thoughts shouldn't be so normal for me, like an everyday thought, but they are.
And I'm getting tired, it takes so much energy from me to not end my life. 
My last near-attempt was a couple of months ago, the only reason it didn't go through was because I heard my flatmates/friends enter our apartment building, and I realized I couldn't do it, because I hadn't wrote a fucking letter.
I keep telling myself it's a thing I have to do if I want to end my life, at least give an explanation. I keep putting it off though, because I know, once they're written, I won't have any excuses left.

And honestly, I just don't see how it's worth it for me to keep going. I don't want to stay, just to try to get better, and being miserable for the next 10 years just for it to be the same. I feel like I just wasn't cut out for life. 
I think I'm giving it a year, I'll try extra hard in 2022, and after that, I think that'll be it if it isn't any different. 

That's it. That's my vent."

But every fucking day feels like that scene in every war movie, where someone looks at all the death around them with that thousand yard stare. My eyes feel glassy all the fucking time and if I stop and stare for too long, my ears start ringing. I’m losing presence in my own body. 

But it’s fucking stupid. I haven’t been in a war. I haven’t just watched hundreds of people die, or fought for my life. I just woke up and tried to make it through to the end of the day. That’s not heroic. It’s something most people wake up and do every fucking day without batting an eye. 

Used to be I feel like I’d go through a range of different emotions, even if most of them were shitty and unhealthy. But for a good while now, I’ve just been in this weird state of mostly numb with the last embers of rage smouldering somewhere in me, but it’s too weak now to access now. Sometimes I listen to the right music and that fans the flames a bit, but more than anything that just makes me sad, realising that I’m too numb to even feel rage properly. 

I don’t even know why I’m still here to be honest. There’s no experiences I’m hoping to have, no places I’m hoping to go. I don’t enjoy anything about this life. I’ve isolated myself for years, so no people around to miss me. Seriously, no one. Only had one friend ever anyway. And that was such a turbulent, chaotic shitshow because of me that she doesn’t even talk to me anymore anyway. Made me realise friendships really aren’t for me at least. 

And relationships aren’t either, never had one, don’t want one. Sure maybe sometimes I want sex or honestly mainly just someone to hold, but I can’t handle all the emotional shit you gotta go through to get to that point with someone. Maybe if I could somehow skip the build-up, the getting to know you phase, straight to the part where you’re 100% comfortable with each other like you’ve known each other your whole lives. Skip straight to the part where we she knows me so well that she doesn’t need to ask me questions about my past. Where she knows I don’t wanna talk at all most of the time. Think it’s pretty fucking obvious to see why that doesn’t work and why I’m not ready for relationships. And hell, sometimes I can’t even handle the intimacy part that I claim to actually want, so a relationship would be a mostly negative experience for me.

Just sick of feeling like I’ve got a thousand-yard stare when nothing is even fucking happening to me. Kinda wish it would, at least I’d have a reason to feel like this. Daydream about getting into fights and losing so that I can feel something for a while, feel bruised and bloody and be able to justify feeling traumatised. Used to cut myself but I fucking hate the scars that left so I’m trying not to do that shit. Just fucking hate feeling so fucked just from waking up in the morning."

Everyone knows these holidays can be a beautiful time to reunite with friends and family, but if you’re going through a rough patch, emotionally, mentally, etc. It can be a real hard time. 

After struggling with some personal issues, a failing marriage, being a parent, advancing my profesional career and battling severe depression and anxiety I was about ready to end it all before the new year, been fighting with suicidal thoughts for months. Therapy has helped a lot, but everything felt like too much for me to deal with. 

Starting this month, I got a call from my brother and sister who’ve always been there for me, inviting me to spend the holiday season with them, and this might just be the break I needed, they’ll never know how close I was to turn off the light switch on me, but they saved me. And even though it’s not over, I can at least live to fight another day. 

Check up on your family, friends, loved ones. You may not know just how much they need that call. 

Happy holidays everyone. I love you all"

To my surprise , she was interested too, we dated.... briefly...

We had lots in common, enjoyed eachothers company as friends, had similar goals and values... on paper we were great together, but we never got enough time to find out for sure. From the moment we agreed to start dating, all I felt around her was severe stress. Like diffusing a bomb levels of stress. Thinkung any moment she's gonna leave, any moment she's gonna abandon me. We started dating and suddenly around her, for no reason whatsoever I had the worst feeling in my life, she did nothing but show me approval and affection, all I felt when she did was tightness in my chest, I stopped eating, I often hyper ventilated.

This is extremely confusing to me, I should have been happy , the girl I had a crush on for years agreed to date me. My stress accumulated until I acted out and started sabotaging myself , I couldn't be myself around her and did some really weird shit.
I should also add that this is my first dating experience ever and I'm fairly sure I have adhd. They say dating is stressful , but the problem is I had no reason to be stressed, and not only was I stressed, I would say that I experienced physical pain and sickness when dating her and also for weeks after we stopped dating.

What's going on? This was 3 months ago, I still can't wrap my head around what caused this, we had so much potential we never got to explore."

My dads mom (who we call our Mema cause I'm from the southern USA) was diagnosed with dementia a few years back. For awhile her symptoms weren't too bad, she just would be a little confused every now and then or she'd forget something, but she was still very much herself. The last time I saw her I could tell that her memory was nothing like what it used to be. She didn't recognize me or  my siblings but I guess I was just in a bit of denial and told myself it was a bad day. That was nearly two years ago. Since covid, I haven't seen my Mema or Papa (what we call my dads dad) at all. Even though I will probably see my Papa again within the next few weeks, I realized that I don't think I'll ever see my Mema again. Even if I do, she won't know who I am and it hurts so damn bad. I just keep thinking of the past small conversation I had with her when her memory was still okay. It was right before leaving her and Papa's house and we were all saying goodbye. Like usual I gave them both a hug and they said they love me and I told them I did too, but my Mema said ""Now Mema loves you, and don't you forget that."" I guess I didn't get what she was trying to say then, but I recently began to understand that the implied meaning was, ""Mema loves you and don't you forget that, even though I know I will."" She knew her memory was going and she didn't know how long it would last, so she wanted me to know that for as long as she remembered me, she loved me. And it just hurts so damn bad

She's still alive and living in a care community for elderly people (I can't think of what they're called.) I know from the last time my dad went to visit her she was doing well physically, but her memory is essentially gone. It hurts because I know I could go see her, but I'm to scared to. I don't think I could handle seeing her knowing that she doesn't know who I am. But I just want so bad for her to know that I love her.

I'm sorry if I'm not making sense, I'm not a super emotional person and this has me crying so my thoughts are muddled. I don't even know if anyone will see this, but it has helped me process my thoughts some and the fact that I am crying while writing this is honestly a good sign for me if that makes any sense.

Thanks for reading this if you did I guess, hope you all have a wonderful new year."

I'll wake up feeling completely rested, feel normal for about 2 hours, and then be ready to go to sleep again. On the days when I can, I do just go back to sleep and repeat the process. 

Energy drinks are my crutch; I drink around 3 a day, 300mg of caffeine each, just to stay awake. I don't feel jittery, I don't get energized, I'm just awake. 

At this point the drinks aren't cutting it, and I'm still falling asleep after drinking them. I could drink a whole one and be asleep within an hour. 

Right now my docs have given me modafinil (an upper) to help me stay awake instead of using the caffeine. Well, I started it the other day, and I still fell asleep within a couple of hours of taking it. And even with caffeine+ medication, I fall asleep after a couple of hours. 

I don't know what to do any more. Nobody seems to care when I tell them something is wrong, because all of the tests I've had done have come back normal. At this point my docs are summing it up to chronic fatigue and depression, but I know when my depression is acting up so that's not it.

I've had to drastically cut back my hours at work because of this, and even then I'm not working to my fullest potential. 

I just.... want answers. I want to know if I'm sick, or if it's major caffeine addiction, or something. I'm tired, my body is tired, my mind is tired.... I just want to go back to working my awesome job full time again and living my life like I used to.


TL;DR I fall asleep even after energy drinks and taking uppers. Not sure if I'm sick or just addicted."

Fuck it. I am strong. I’ve spent my whole life saying I’m not (and still do) but whatever, I am. I’ve had one of the 20 most painful conditions you can have, chronically, and dealt with it every day for the last 5 years in constant pain 24/7. I’ve dealt with agonising pain when no one would believe me, I’ve had surgery, I’ve been called slurs and worthless by my parents, I’ve come across so many creeps and pedos and even irl people asking where I live and asking me to get in their car etc when I was only 8-11. I do boxing and draw and looked after a house of 6 people for 6 months as a 13 yr old. When my parent was in the ICU for 6 months, I would go shopping after school and cook dinner for 6 and study and work out and still be yelled at. I don’t get angry at people, I always make handmade + store bought gifts for people when I can, I earn for myself, I’ve been bullied, I’ve attempted suicide 12 times and I’m still here. 

I hate hate mentioning this to people because in my mind I’m still a weak, insecure child. So if not for anyone else, this post is just to remind me that I can get through shit.

A hole filled with terror that someone will snap and explode, that I will say the wrong thing, walking on eggshells at all times, with my friends, in my career, sitting alone at a restaurant. 

I HAVE dated and I have loved people - but they were all extremely violent and abusive people. I wonder why I always stayed in those kinds of relationships?? Now as an adult, I try not to blame them. But I can't help it sometimes. When they ask me why I am not married yet, I stay silent because otherwise I will probably just scream and scream and cry until I throw up.

My parents divorced when I was 7.

My father is a hard headed Canadian who doesn't take constructive criticism. This led to my mother and him fighting all the time when I was younger. 

He has the emotional intelligence of a brick. I've seen him get emotional maybe 3 times in my life.

He'll be 60 next year and his health is starting to concern me. He's an alcoholic in denial, and has been a workaholic his entire life. He is overweight, stressed all the time and has high to extreme blood pressure issues which have hospitalized him multiple times overnight. 

Every time my dad calls me it's because he needs help with something. He never calls to just chat. Today he called me to tell me he's no longer employed and he needs help to market himself so he can continue working. 

But here's the catch.

If he can't get back working again, I know he's gonna die. 

He's the example of a human where work is all they know. If he can't get back out there he's gonna get sick and die, I just feel this coming. 

The shitty part is I know this is manipulative as fuck and not fair to me at all because I'm an adult with my own life and priorities. 

But I feel like if I don't help him, his health will just get worse and he's gonna get sick and die and I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore...

I love my father but I can't believe he seems like he's having so many issues with his life and it seems like it's now my problem... 

I hate this and would appreciate any words of wisdom/encouragement of what I could do to help me through this bull...

Thankyou"

We also live with his best friend ""Vinny"" (28M) 

Marco and Vinny have worked at a warehouse since they were teenagers and the job pays really well. They have brothers and cousins who work there too so it's like a little family. There is a woman named Jessica (28F) who also started working there around 6ish years ago.

So before Marco and I got together, he and Jessica went out on a date and apparently it went terribly- according to him, she was insanely possessive and got really jealous when he spoke to the waitress to give his order and things like that. So he distanced himself from her and he and I started dating a few months later. Fast forward to this year, a position at the factory opened up that would be really good for me, so I applied and started working there a few weeks after we got married. Jessica befriended me right away as we worked in the same department. But something about her always seemed a bit off around me? Like interested in what I have to say one second and bored/annoyed the next. But she is very interested in Vinny now, and the feelings aren't mutual. In fact he is seeing a girl named Amber (26) who I really like and am becoming fast friends with. 

Last week, Jessica stopped by our house because she wanted to hang out. The guys were both working. She brought with her a bunch of high end beauty products that she said she didn't need and thought to give them to me. It was basically a lot of shampoos, conditioners, skincare, makeup that she hasn't used or only used a couple of times, and a lot of vitamin type things? Like these tiny bottles of herbal drinks and pills for energy or calcium etc. She put the vitamins in a small satchel/purse type of thing and I didn't open it that day but she told me what was in there. 

I was a little confused as I have my own products but I just figured she had too many and it was a nice gesture? She also mentioned that I should share some of the products with Amber. I joked that there was enough shampoo to give one to Marco and Vinny but she got all serious and told me not to share girly shampoo with the guys as they would be offended. She then started laughing and playing it off as a joke. I thought it was weird but I thanked her for them. After she left I checked the shampoos and conditioners and some of them had a very off smell. My sense of smell has always been extremely dull I guess due to genetics but I could smell something strange so I threw out most of the sets and kept only two sets that seemed to have a nice smell and wasn't out of date. I was going to use one set for myself and see if Amber wanted the other set.

The day after that when I took a shower I decided to try the shampoo that Jessica gave me. After a minute I felt a burning/stinging sensation and a sharp smell so I rinsed it out and used my normal conditioner. More hair than usual fell out during my shower and after drying it but luckily it was not too noticable. I assumed I was allergic to an ingredient in the shampoo as I'm allergic to something in certain chapsticks and the burning sensation felt the same as that. 

I forgot to throw the shampoo and conditioner away, and later when Marco came home he took a shower and yelled for me loudly after a few minutes. I came in and he was saying that new shampoo was burning his scalp and I told him to rinse it out then use my regular conditioner to treat his scalp and hair. When he got out we each put some of the conditioner on my arm to test it. Of course, after a minute it started to burn. Marco told me that he noticed the sharp smell right as he was pumping the shampoo out, but didnt think much of it... and as I've mentioned my sense of smell is not great. These sets weren't sealed and new. Jessica had used them a couple of times, she said. So it may have been rather dumb of me but I never thought a friend would give me something that's been tampered with. 

So I inspected the little sachel she gave me of medicine but guess what! Those weren't in medicine bottles either. Just plastic bags with pills and written instructions like ""these are biotin pills for your skin and nail growth! Take three a day"" Or a random little bottle of liquid ""this is kombucha power shot take a sip a day"" etc. And Jessica somehow knew I hadn't even opened the bag. At work she would say ""I can tell you haven't taken your medicine yet!"" Stuff like that. I'm just glad I didn't give any of the shampoo or makeup to Amber, because who knows what could have been in them? But now I just wish I had never met her."

I can't stop thinking about it. And I try to hold it in and keep it together, because thinking about it hurts but it hurts more to be vulnerable. And I try to escape reality, so I sleep for hours. And when I can't sleep anymore, I try to sleep even more.

And the guilt wrenches my heart. Because I'm grateful, I really am, I might have a lot of things which other people wish for. But the thing I really want slips through my fingers like pure liquid, and the moment I thought it was over, it's like I wake up from a sweet dream only to find out it was just that. 

A dream."

But since about a week I can really see a new light at the end of the road. I made new friendships, got out of my shell, started to work more on myself as well as my mental health. I am finally content again with myself for the first time in a long time, even while I was in the relationship.

I guess I just wanted to share this to prove thatwe always can have bad phases in our life, but that they also will pass as long as one tries to correct the problems he recognizes. There will always come a good time again"

So please read everything. I’m (26 f) married, and I have a son. 6-7 years ago I was on dentist school but I dropped out and change career, at that time I had a school classmate, let’s call her Marie. 

So Marie was a GORGEOUS girl, very very beautiful, precious eyes, long blonde hair, and she was the side chick of a married doctor, let’s call him Jerry. I honestly didn’t care cause we were like 20 years old and that was considered “normal” in the dentist school, and Marie and I were never close friends, just classmates although she was a very nice person. 
I remember that Marie used to post selfies of herself on social media showing her body and for me that what’s cool for her since she looked happy.

Now Jerry had a reputation for being jealous, possessive, and also a cheater.
Since I left dentist school I didn’t know what happened to them and I forgot.

Fast forward to 2021, one night that I couldn’t sleep, I was scrolling on IG and I saw a picture of Marie, and Jerry had commented some sweet emojis, so I checked her profile, she had like 3 selfies and in each one, Jerry had commented, my first thought was that he finally got divorced and was dating her, I honestly felt happy for Marie, since I always think that she deserved a real relationship instead of being the side chick. 

But something felt off, so I went to FB and I checked Jerry profile, everything was “normal” he had pictures with his daughter only, then I found the profile of Jerry’s mom, and then the profile of Jerry’s WIFE,and his wife had pictures of Jerry, her, and their daughter TOGETHER. HE WAS STILL CHEATING HIS WIFE WITH MARIE, I just couldn’t believe it, I felt angry, he was cheating on his wife and also playing with Marie. 

So I took screenshots of the comments of Jerry’s on Marie’s IG page, and I sent them to Jerry’s wife Facebook profile using a fake account. 

A couple days later, Jerry deleted all the comments on Maries photos, and then Marie had deleted almost all her photos on IG only letting one selfie, they didn’t follow each other on IG anymore either.

I thought I did the best I could exposing a cheater and giving Marie her freedom but still I feel guilty and I can’t discuss this with anyone"

I get little to no support from her and her way of expressing and hiding such is saying “you’re just young” (she’s 5 years older than me). She’s sometimes expressed how little my advices matter as I am younger than her, and that passionately hurts. 

After asking for a girlfriend too much, maybe the universe finally decided to give me one, but not to make me happy, but rather to show me I just shouldn’t have one right now."

So I’m not even sure if she’s my cousin or if we’re related in some way. I moved to Canada in middle school and since then I have bonded with my cousins and relatives so we spent a lot of time together at each other’s houses. The “cousin” I like started showing up more and more over the years to our “get togethers” but I never thought anything of it and never had any feelings for her. Recently she’s been coming to almost all our “get togethers” and I have since felt a special bond or connection with her. 

She is turning 17 in a few days and I’m 20. But I will turn 21 when she’s 17 so it’s a 4 year gap but she’s a little mature for her age. Whenever all the cousins are together us two stick together almost all the time. We purposely try sit together while watching movies and also cuddle sometimes. I’m not sure if she’s just over friendly or she has some sort of feelings for me too. I had been dealing with depression and anxiety for the past year or two and her being “nice” or showing affection caught me off guard because I hadn’t felt like that in a long time. I’m the type of person to not really miss anyone when I’m gone or if they’re gone but since she left my house today I have been missing her a lot and we’ve being texting and snapping back and forth.

Idk what to do about this and who to talk to. My siblings and family have started to notice our bonding and have called me out on it too. My older sister called it disgusting how I’m so close with her because she’s our cousin but idk how much of that is true."

rsg8gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rsg8gx/its_been_the_worst_year_of_my_life/,its been the worst year of my life,3,4,1640909218.0,"The shit storm of 2021 began with my dearest friend Meg being moved off of my shift at work. In 2020 she was moved on to B shift full time and we quickly became very good friends. A bond that working 12 hours locked in a room with just one other person can bless or torture you with. 

In contrast to 2021, 2020 was one of the best years of my life. I had an amazing career in an essential service that kept me working. I had a wonderful partner to spend my days and nights with during covid, my coworkers became a tight knit group that got together frequently and coming to work became the best part of my week. If you knew me well, you would know just how much that meant to me. And to finish 2020 strong I took the plunge and bought a condo on my own, which is no small achievement on Vancouver Island. I thought 2021 would build on all the wonderful things 2020 brought me but life always has other plans, doesnt it?


When Meg was moved off of my shift in January 2021, our tight knit work unit became unbound. Meg was truly the glue and without her everything changed. Her replacement was one of the most difficult personalities I have had to navigate as an adult. I won't say much more on that but it was very trying. B shift would never be the same, I was devastated.


For the majority of 2020 I had been working through a relationship with my then partner Andrew. I thought we were really working through things together but as the troubling patterns became too repetitive I struggled to keep the relationship afloat. After he ruined my birthday in February with a horrible attitude for which reason he could not explain, I asked that he invest in therapy so that we could grow beyond our troubles. He was resistant.


Then my Grandpa passed away on March 4th. My last living grandparent. The patriarch of our family, the only grandparent I got to have a relationship with as an adult. It was a huge loss and amid covid, I was deeply grieved to not be with my family. So when Andrew ended our year long relationship over the phone with me a few days later I was completely struck. I didnt think it could get any worse.


The biggest blow yet came on March 18 when we were all called in to work for a sudden meeting. We all hoped this would be amazing news, that we were merging with our sister Fire Dispatch Ctr. to become a stronger centre. The Chief came in wearing his white shirt, this was official business. I will never forget the moment my whole world fell away from me. He had barely spoken the words as I realized the gravity of that moment. I was in full hysterics upon hearing that they were closing our 911 dispatch centre. My career as a Fire Dispatcher, my passion, my family for the past 8 years would be dissolved in just 9 months come December. I would have to continue working those 9 months, bearing the grief of the impending doom.


I have been through a lot in life, I have survived suicide attempts and drug addiction but nothing will ever compare to losing something so special to me. The foundation I had built my entire life on just crumbled beneath me. 


I couldn't be with family due to covid, my partner abandoned me and my tight knit work family was in pieces. I realized then that this year was going to be the loneliest year I have ever faced. It was all very symbolic. It was God or the Universe or whatever you belive in showing me that I had to learn how to show up for myself in a meaningful way because I could not reliably expect physical or emotional comfort in anything or anyone. And isn't it true, that we all honestly go through this life alone.. at the end of the day, we really do.


I have never been forced to bear witness to my wounds so clearly. My regular patterns of drinking and numbing with empty vices began to fail me. Though I still cling to these vices at times, they do not allow me the escape that they used to. Even drunk I would still find myself staring straight into the abyss of my pain. The accumulation of wounds and suffering that I was never able to fullly witness before all stacked against me, slow motion toppling down. It feels like suffocating.


The year continued to be filled with burdens, frustrations and disappointments. Witnessing my dear friends, family and colleagues facing tremendous trials of their own. And still, I kept walking the path alone through the dark, actually more like stumbling blindly. Taping myself together with bits and pieces of support from people I collected and foggy nights drowned in beer. Only truly finding solace in music and the sticky heat of a yoga studio.. which saw most of my tears.. what a strange place to cry ... and yet often, the only place I could. And now covid has stolen that refuge too.


I had hope, that perhaps this big change was some benefic guidance toward a path that would see me having a regular routine, moving away from shift work to benefit my health and to find new depths of fulfillment, even if it would mean struggling to pay my mortage with a $10/hour pay cut at a city office job. I thought for certain my employer would find a way to accommodate me in another position.


And yet here I find myself painfully sober, curled into a messy tangle of tears and snot and blankets, on the 30th of December with a phone call from the City I have been an employee with for 8.5 years telling me that I did not get the internal assistant position that I interviewed for. What a slap in the face. To have my whole career as a 911 operator and dispatcher for the Fire Department taken away from me due to politics and money and then have the city who employed me in that position refuse to provide me with an administrative job that I am over qualified for. I have known no greater betrayal.


I am plunged into darkness just when I had found the horizon of hope. This year has held the most disapointment, rejection, tears, the most loss and the most bittersweet embrace of grief's many memories. Its a burning fire in my heart that steals the air from my lungs. It scorches my throat and chokes me of my peace.


But still, I am grateful that I have life, because there were many times I wished I didn't and I survived. Still I have hope for happiness and connection, because I am learning to know and truly feel my worthiness of those experiences. Still I manage moments of joy, because if 26 years of therapy has taught me anything .. it is that the real grit, the truth of life is in those moments where you can experience and make space for all the conflicting emotions simultaneously and love yourself with deep compassion through them.


And truly i know I'll be stronger for it all but sincerely, 2021, go fuck yourself and good riddance."

I am a teen. The reason why I made this post was because of my family's current socio-economic situation and how they're treating my future.

**BACKSTORY**: 

I was born into a relatively well-off family with my mom as a teacher and my dad as a doctor(cardiologist in a rural hospital). Their relationship was pretty good up until a couple of months where things just got sour. After verbal abuse, neglect, and the fact that my mom caught my dad cheating made they divorced in the 2000's when I was barely a year old. After lots of custody battles, court appearances, I believe sometime in 2012 is when things settled down and the following were in place:

* my mom received 40k in child support 
* Me visiting my dad every week on the weekends

After many years of alternating households(moms apartment or dads apartment(or also grandma apartment if he was busy which he was most of the time)), many vacations, and luxuries events my mom started dating this  guy and shortly after married in when I was around 5 years old. My bio dad has already been married to the woman who he was cheating on and was jealous/shocked abt it. He had 2 kids(there cool but I rarely see them) with my stepmom and my stepdad gave me 2 half-siblings which I love.  

**WHAT'S HAPPENING RN:**

My stepdad coming in the picture honestly if I'm being quite frank shook things up a bit. For starters, he's more serious about parenting, disciplined, and stern(doesn't like it when people mess around with him). He came from Israel poor but ended up owning a successful barbershop that was paying him(pre covid probably 150-230k in a big city). It didn't take long before he and my bio dad disliked each other and he wasn't enthusiastic about driving me to him every week. So my stepdad and my mom(I'm not too sure how this happened) but ended up making the visitation every other week and ONLY Saturdays which my bio dad somehow obliged to this. Things got EVEN sour with me and my dad has always put my mom and stepdad down with racist remarks towards my mom. Not to mention he also opened up his own office and practice which is probably made him a millionaire by now(he owns a nice house with 2 range rover sports). My stepdad bought us a house similar sized to my bio dad's but not as big and also not to mention didn't drive as an expensive car. HE'S ALSO VERY FINANICNLLY illiterate and hasn't gone to college. MY bio mom at this time decided to be a substitute teacher instead of full-time to support my 2 half-siblings growing up.

**WHY I'M PISSED:**

As you may know, with the COVID-19 pandemic, LOTS of small businesses have shut down. This unfortunately includes my stepdads. I remember the sad look on his face and was myself sad and depressed. The only income source was my mom's teaching job and the 35k child support paying all the mortgage bills, food, phone bills, car bills, etc. He then proceeded to take out a big loan to do a new business...which fucking flopped because the guy who previously owned it got cancer and probably just wanted to sell it to get over with. AND in addition to that took out another loan to make some sort of haircuts on wheels  which also flopped. He probably has -80k in debt right now and I'm JUST FUCKING PISSED THAT HE PUT OUR FAMILIES FINANCIAL SITUATION DOWN.  He's currently applying to be a security job, home attendant, low-level jobs. I'm now ashamed of even telling my friends what my stepdad does for a living because of it. I cant upgrade to the latest phone, can't get my usual expensive stuff, no more vacation for years. ALL THE FUCKING child support going where????

**WHAT SHOULD I DO?:**

I'm asking what to do as my life goal was to be like my bio dad but unlike him, going into a computer-related field and eventually starting a tech company. I've been reading books like OUTLIERS which honestly just tell me that the whole ""work hard"" bs that my bio mom tells me always is NOT TRUE. MOST people who are successful have parents that help them, people that help them. I am a full A student, have already invested in stocks, know how to code, but honestly I'm starting to recognize I'm probably just better off in a 9-5 job. I dont think she realizes that 40k saved up for 4 years is like high 6 figures. Only kids with upper-middle-class parents can achieve the life I want to achieve. Am I not right? How do I expect to reach my goals if my family is in debt, I have a rich bio dad that resents me and probably won't give me a penny and just a horrible life in general."

I just told the person, who I think the world of, that I didn’t care about our breakup when that couldn’t be further from the truth. So much has happened that I know he would never be able to come back from and even some stuff that I can’t. How do y’all get the strength to move on? I already regret how everything ended because I didn’t know if I could find happiness with him again. In reality though I feel like I never tried and I let him down. I just want him to find happiness even if that means I’m not around to see it."
rsg1kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rsg1kq/overwhelmed_by_feeling_like_a_failure/,Overwhelmed by feeling like a failure,3,2,1640908682.0," I'm 22 and live with my partner and his mom. We get along and communicate really well, and it feels like home to me. It's great being with the person I love and have loved for 5 years but with me being a foreigner in their country - I've been undergoing everything for my residency to stay here fully with them. it's been demotivating when what we needed didn't come through. My partner struggles a lot within himself and it's a struggle for him to speak about his problems, without him wanting to put it all back inside sometimes, so I try to stay aware of that and try not to push about certain things too much. There's been so much that he's left unsaid and unchecked for himself that he's lost motivation for himself. I want to stay here with him, an after one application failed and having to start a new one, I'm trying to do it  for myself. So I can start a freelancing business and provide for my family here and stay. 
Yet, here i am feeling useless. The last few months on the inside have felt like shit, for most of the day it feels like I'm on autopilot a lot of the time. Most days i still manage to do stuff around the house, helping my soon to be mother in law where i can as well. Especially since part of her toe was removed back in April from a nasty infection. Where all of it, just helping, and everything used to make me happy, I do it just to do it now. Sometimes even with doing those normal mundane things, like making the bed or doing the laundry, my brain always brings up some of the biggest things I'm struggling with. Then boom. There I am, crying all over the sheets, struggling to compose myself. It just goes from 0-100 and then my brain is on a railroad track that doesn't stop. It becomes a struggle to pull it back before i get completely overwhelmed, but i know it's from not talking about what keeps sitting and festering in my head. I've felt so defeated after having a miscarriage more than 8 months ago, with what happened during that just left me so confused about myself. Since then it feels like I'm constantly chasing something that I'm not even sure of. It's left me so scared to talk about the fact that i feel so heartbroken. That the date of our baby's birth came and went and that day felt like a blur of numbness and overwhelming sadness. The pregnancy itself and the miscarriage brought up some issues with a person in my past who sexually abused me, and I've confronted him a few months ago. It was going well but at the same time, I dropped it and never thought about it again. Just said ""it was too much for right now"", and put it away. Though it kept coming up to remind me of it's urgency.
There's been so much distance that I've taken from family and friends, especially online. Lurker mode was activated, just always watching other people talking and connecting. It's felt so empty.
Since everything is going on and I'm trying to work on myself, be healthier for the future and trying staying here with my partner; it's super fucking scary trying to figure out the financials when I have almost nothing at this. No job, can't work until everything works out with the application at the moment. I'm trying to get the funds I need to fulfill said application requirements, and without supplement from my partner when he has no job, I'm looking to find any loan I can. The options are feeling severely limited. I've never done that officially really, only with family, and the thought of being in more debt than i am makes me so fucking stressed. Even with family, borrowing or having to ask for help makes me feel less competent as a human being. That I'm less of an adult, and as someone who wants to bring a person into this world that it would go so wrong. This isn't what was planned, we really wanted to get married and have everything go through, but there's also personal struggles going on withing all of us. I don't know if I'm being helpful enough for my family here. I'm truly grateful for them, for every kindness they gave, but it feels like everything that I have done just isn't enough. It feels like me coming and trying to be here with him was more trouble than what we wanted, what was planned, and i feel like it is on me. I really regret it sometimes, even though that saddens me.
Especially now, when i have nowhere to go back to from here officially, before here was my worst living conditions of being in a tent for 6 months and not real access to anything even hot water. At least after that i had gotten to stay with my family for a while and planned to be with my partner. But I've been wandering around for a while mostly in my head.
I feel like a wandering, useless person. Even if I worked a shit ton back then, even the days I pulled myself up despite not giving a shit about who I was, or who cared for me, everything piling up just weighs me down. I was the person who could have done better in my own eyes. Like I should have stayed, waited and just suffered struggling alone before coming here.. that all the loss and problems is just the bad karma I deserve. 
Hopefully just throwing everything out here will help but damn my head hurts from trying to not spam the heck out of this.

I'm going to fix this later when I calm down a bit, it may be jumping around a lot and really bad grammar but I can't fix it now, ADHD emotional brain says no more.. but sorry for the long mess..

Edit: Fixed some of the weird jumpy parts and grammar for reading/my brain as well and added small bits has been lingering since earlier"

Additionally, my mom is adopted and has never sought out her birth family, so growing up I always wondered about people I could be related to and my ancestry. Fast forward to Christmas 2020 and I get a 23&me kit from my boyfriend, so of course I send off my tube of spit the first chance I get. Once I got my results I found out my ancestry and discovered some “new” relatives I’ve never heard of, all located around my hometown. This led to a very intense conversation with my mom about my bio dad and getting all my questions answered. 

Like the title says, I’m the result of an affair between my mom and bio dad. They meet back in the 80’s at a swap meet and were together for about eight years before I was born. My mom said she didn’t know for a while that he was married, and that after she found out it didn’t “matter/bother her” because she wasn’t looking to get married to him or have him leave his wife and son. Besides his company, the only thing my mom wanted was me, so she intentionally got pregnant by him. After getting all the situational details and asking my mom my dads name (again, I’ve been asking my whole life) I paid one of those websites to look peoples info up and found out what he looks like, where he lives, where he’s worked, and multiple forms of contact information. 

I guess this is where my problem is. I have all this information about him and have the means to contact him, but I know he’s still married to the same woman he cheated on. I also know his son passed away over 15 years ago. I want to meet and get to know my dad, but I also don’t want to upend his wife’s life by me coming into the picture."

I fully recognize I'm in a privileged position when it comes to my career, I just want to talk about the other side of it that I wish someone prepared me for.

I'm a visual artist. I get invited to parties to do art live and sell my work. Occasionally I get invited to art galleries. I meet at least 100 people each night.  Some of them are artists, some fans, some are just trying to hit it. I have fun with what I do until the sun comes up.

The only person I'd call a friend right now in my life is my brother. I don't hang out with people outside of work. I've been invited out by followers a few times, but every time it felt like I was treated more like a novelty than a person. I know it's not from a bad place and they don't mean harm but I prefer to stay grounded about my self-image. Yes men have never interested me. 

I wish I had someone to share and grow with. I feel like I'm hanging onto connections that don't really serve me. My childhood friend is lovely, but we're such different people. We're outgrowing each other and it's scaring me. Not because I think she's worse off without me I'm just scared of the silence that'll follow if I let her go.

I don't really know what to do anymore. I keep thinking about good conversations I've had in the past and wish I could have them again. I don't really draw anymore, I'm struggling to find a reason to. Is it too dramatic to say I wanna feel truly loved for me, not just the work I put out? Not by the public, just by one special friend or two."

Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my primary language. I (16F) had a very rocky relationship with my dad. He and my mom are in separation (not divorced, Idk why), haven't spoken for a few years. He moved out like 4/5 years ago, partially due to a big debt he owned to the point we would sometimes have to hide from like court people (I dont remember the correct word) trying to confiscate stuff from our house - he decided we shouldn't go through that and moved out. Since than we see each other less and less - now it's like once every 2 months or so. Ive grown to realise he doesn't really care about me or my sister (19) enought to want to spend more time with us. Lately I realised I basically dont need him at all, other than financial support. I dont see him as a father figure - he doesn't know anything more complicated about me, I dont tell him when I'm feeling down or anything. He doesn't do any real parenting (like my mom) but gets to go out for pizza with me every once in a while and act like everything is great. The faking is killing me. I spent a lot of time in therapy, getting over him leaving us and I dont feel anything towards him but sadness.  But at the same time, he can be so nice. Hes funny and I love joking around with him. Sometimes he acts so caring and sweet, I dont want him to be sad. I want a dad, he doesn't want a responsibility. Every time I see him it's like ripping open a bruise that just healed. My sister is okay with just basically using him for money - I cant stand doing that. I'm wondering If i should stop contacting him. He is fine with the relationship we have now, but its not enough for me. But I know he won't change - my mom went to therapy for years and encouraged him to go aswell but he didn't want to. Sometimes I just forget about him and it's fine, I'm fine without him in my life. Sorry if this is hectic but I really just need to get this off my chest and I guess I'm sorta curious what other people have to say about this situation. If you have any advice I'd love to hear it."

The worst case for me was when I had windshield wiper fluid stored in the closet and I had an irrational fear of drinking it. It's because it looks like Gatorade it caused some unwanted thoughts. Luckily I just don't store that kind of stuff in the house anymore. The other one is more subtle. If I open a case of juice for example and any part of brain is telling me it's been tampered with, I get really nervous. It's extremely unlikely that someone would open up a juice container where there are cameras and staff anywhere and try to poison someone. Usually if the bottle doesn't have multiple coverings I'm frantically trying to remember what the proper casing is like. If a bottle is tight, but not super tight. I get a little nervous. Someone once left a whole box of candy canes in the apartment lobby and I took them as a snack. There was no evidence of tampering, but I still freaked out that maybe it was poisoned. I could only finish a few. 9 times out 10 I'm fine as long as the covering does what I expect it to do, but unfortunately my brain roams around sometimes."

apparently an egg is someone who is trans but not really trans they just dont know it? ( sounds like some made up shit by gen z)

the worst part is they feel empowered if not entitled to threathen everyone who is outside of their non-weird bubble.

for instance, lesbian/gays have problems with medical insurances and there has been changes so that we can get covered.

now we have eggs going, straight people and transphobic cause they dont like femboys or “trans girls”. fuck them fuck them for not liking us.

He's my little goofball, y'know, we're super attached to each other (he follows me around everywhere), just all around an adorkable cat. Love him to death. I found him when he was only 6 weeks old, so I'm basically all he knows, he's only 5.5 now. 

Yesterday I took him to the vet, they did an ultrasound, and the vet told me they found a very large tumor in his stomach. Got it biopsied to see if it's malignant, but even if it's benign, I'm not sure if a surgery to remove it will be enough to save him, plus I'm a student currently paying outrageous prices for rent and my tuition, so idk how I'm going to afford to pay for a surgery like that. I've already spent so much on  trying to help him with a special diet, dental, etc before I knew about the tumor.

On top of that, he's lost so much weight. He used to be such an energetic, dorky cat, but now all he does is lay around and try to munch on food when he can keep it down. It feels like everything is ""one of his last"" times to experience stuff, for me to cuddle with him, I know it's stupid to be so emotionally invested in a cat, but i just had this picture of him still being around when I'm in my 30s, and now idek if he'll make another month. I'm just absolutely crushed and it kills me to see him just laying there when I know he's got to be in pain.

It's the holidays, so all of my friends are out of the country and flew back home, so it's just me, alone, in my apartment, with my dying cat, trying to figure out how to make his possible last days as comfortable as possible after I probably traumatized him by flying him across the world with me. I just, idk, I just want to sob but I can't and then I feel dumb for being this dramatic about my cat but I can't help it.

I'm sorry, I just really needed to vent and I didn't want to burden any of my friends over the holidays and when they're with they're family blubbering about my cat.



**UPDATE - Jan. 12, 2022**
 - (I've never done an update before, so if this is wrong, I'm so sorry!)

If anyone is interested, I do have a bit of an update for my cat. I took him to the oncologist on Monday where they did another ultrasound. Turns out he has a proper egg-sized tumor in his stomach, his stomach wall is nearly all inflamed to 3cm (when it's supposed to only be 3mm thick), and the lymphoma is in both of kidneys. I decided to try chemo for him, but I'm not the most hopeful of a positive outcome. We'll see how it goes.

I did get him a nice sweater to help keep him warm since it's pretty cold here and his poor abdomen and half his side is shaved. The very least I can do is try my best to keep him comfy and happy as possible.


**UPDATE - Mar. 14, 2022**
Well, it's been a few months, and Monday was little Galli's last day with me. He had a good run with the treatment, and had about a month where he was back to his old goofy self; however, within this past week he really went downhill incredibly quickly. Unfortunately, while the mass in his stomach had all but disappeared and his kidney values seemed okay, a massive tumor in his lungs had developed that pushed his trachea up against his spine. Fluid had also filled his lungs, and there was nothing else to do except give him the dignity and respect of a painless passing. Thankfully, one of my roommates went with me to the appointment, which I really appreciated bc otherwise i would've gone alone and that just would've been even more depressing. 

I've decided to get a memorial tattoo with his paw print. He deserves that much, he was my little dude, I'm probably never gonna find another cat I bind with so well."

As soon as she found out she had it, she chose to simply allow the process to happen and pass away. Despite what the doctors said, she was around for a lot less time than any of us could ever anticipate.

Then, I saw her twice in my dreams, and had what may be considered a strange reaction.

The first time I went to a mall with her and I didn't really acknowledge her that much, but then a dragon-snake attacked (because dreams), and she fell. I went to help her up, but then I suddenly stopped, slowly got up, and with a deadpan look and tone I said, ""You're supposed to be dead"" before running off.

The second time, I was running from danger and I found myself in Abuela's house, and I saw her. Once again I seemed to stop and stare at her before saying, ""I thought you were dead"" in a deadpan tone again.

Like you would think seeing your deceased relative or someone that was close to you would spark more standard feelings like tears, joy, sadness, or something, but nope. I have this kind of reaction instead."

In five years time the family will multiply in membership

In five years time a new generation will sprout.

In five years time I hope you have gained knowledge within and without.

In five years time  the tick will stop and hit the direction of south.

In five years time a bundle of joy none will be able to live without.

In five years time a new seed will begin to sprout.

In five years time, a new cosmic egg, that will spring up and shout:

Welcome to the new Age! You've made it right on time!

I'll get the horses ready for a night ride.

There is still a lot of planning to do, but this baby is getting delivered come hell or high water.

You better hope it's high water, for I know you can't stand the heat.

And this is a kitchen swiftly we won't get out of.

But trust your elder, and hold steady, now you possess the strength of wisdom and time.

The divine, of the opposition are steering clear, the favor is ours.

The more salt they throw on it, the more they bless our house.

Move quickly while they stew in the juice of their own hate and fear.

Don't look back and keep yourself austere.

Let them screech within their own circles of flea infested birds.

Read this and act on accord, I'll be waiting for you on the date given,

In the place you and I only know how.

We will keep contact

Until sooner, rather than later, see you then.

We have so much in common from what we like, to our approach in life, perspective about people, things, etc. I even try to get max courses with her just so I could spend more time with her cause I haven't met a single person in my life up till now (21M) who understands me this much, and It's the first time that I've loved someone so dearly and so unconditionally. Yesterday we had our final exam so we decided to study together so the next day I picked her up and we went to a cafe everything was going amazing we're having a great laugh and a good time, then a friend of her showed up so she goes to meet him all good. So, after the exam we decided to go watch the sunset and have something to eat so we went there it was a magical evening listening to her favorite songs and talking about them while watching the sunset. Also we live far away from the beach and I'm very bad with routes while she's good with them, bearing this in mind and the fact that we'll be going together back home I was chill. Then the same friend texted and she asked me kai a friend is coming to meet to which I was like yeah cool but then when he showed up she straight up left and said I'll be going with him and we'll hangout etc. to which I was straight up shocked and seeing my shocked face she asks casually (Are you feeling bad?) Being a person who never usually complains or say something straight up I replied no it's okay. And she left :( I pulled up Google maps and started going my way but I couldn't get over the thought of what just happened meanwhile my car broke down took several wrong turns, got stuck in a huge traffic jam and reached home at like 10 pm she texts me at 1 saying did you get home like yes ofcourse I did, but what's the point of asking now.

I first started watching porn at 12 but had been masturbating 2 years prior to that. I of course had my newly exposed interest and the easy accesibility made it even worse. I eventually started developing very pervy personality that had consequenses for my social life in my late middle school years. On youtube I watched a video from a big satire youtuber in my country about how he was looking for a girlfriend (ironically of course) and a girl my age (I was 14 at the time, she was 15) had made a dirty comment in the comment section. We added each other on email and eventually got around to meeting in real life. We had become boyfriend and girlfriend before we even met but that was just because we were both in it for the same thing. I’m talking about sex of course. It became very clear that non of us understood how a relationship works given we had skipped a bunch of the fundamentals and went straight to having sex. Non of us were ready for it, it was very clear but my mind was messed up from porn and just wanted to have sex. This is where it went downhill from me. I wasn’t ready and I was shocked when I had trouble staying hard and only lasted around a minute before I had to pull out but I don’t know what I expected. I was way to young and not ready at all. I was underweight at the time and all I could think of was sex. We broke up after 2 months and hasn’t talked since.

This kind of has ruined my relationship with dating and changed my outlook on girls. I have since changed massivly and hasn’t dated since then because I have been afraid the same thing will happen again. I’m 18 and focusing on myself knowing I need to sort myself out before I try and focus on relationships. I have learned a lot since then and I promise myself that my next relationship will have more value to it and not be centered around sex."

In college, as I began to lose weight, I was still struggling get a girlfriend. It made me feel awful. It made me feel worthless. Something that comes soo easy to most people, how could I be so incompetent at talking to girls and just relationships? Every semester in college, I’d write a few goals and one of them would be to have sex for the first time. That never happened. And after that I got busy with work and the only way to meet girls was through dating app. Tried Hinge, bumble, and Tinder and could not even get any matches. 

I was frustrated. At 24, I had yet to experience something that some people experience at 15. I felt ashamed and self-conscious of being a virgin, especially as a guy, where most of your guy friends are talking about their girlfriend or girls they has sex with. I felt hopeless. But during COVID, I started therapy and my life got flipped upside down. I learnt to build a healthier relationship with my own self, learned to manage/deal with anxiety and stress, gained clarity on what I wanted, and began working out. 6 months after therapy, I noticed that I had become an attractive man. I groomed myself, wore good clothes (took me from a 5 to 7.5), worked out (gave me newfound confidence), and dabbled into my entrepreneurial dream. I moved to NYC. And that’s when things began changing. I was able to easily chat with women in real life interactions, go on dates with them but even with this, I was still self-conscious about expressing my sexuality. Because I was worried I’d come across as inexperienced and they’d leave me. 

But then I got matched with this girl on Hinge and we clicked. We kissed on our first date (my first kiss ever), made out on the second date for 50 minutes (first time doing any complicated kisses), and had sex on our third date. I was so fucking nervous that I couldn’t stay hard but I made her cum twice. I take that as a fucking win. And she was surprised the way I took control and went for it. In any case, I finally experienced not just sex but that level of intimacy with someone that I had never experienced before. It felt like an important growth moment for me like becoming a man. And I feel fucking proud of myself. From a chubby ugly kid in high school and college who couldn’t talk to girls to a fit attractive confident man who just goes for it is what I’m so excited about. It took so much hard work. I broke down so much during this journey. I cried. I felt hopeless. I was depressed. But I stuck with my good habits, stuck with therapy, hit the gym, read interesting books and it made me more confident which in return made me an attractive man to women. 

So I just wanted to share that. Im proud despite knowing I still have a lot to learn. I feel grateful. Thanks for listening."

We were as closes as two friends could be throughout uni. We lived together, studied together, went to parties together, holidayed together - it's easier to list the times we weren't together than were. 

The friendship started to tail off after five years. She started to make excuses for not meeting up, and told me that her boyfriend wanted her to be friends with the girlfriends of his friends and not me. He said we were bad influences on each other because we liked to go out a lot, and I assume he gave her an ultimatum. 

One day she just stopped replying to my messages altogether. I couldn't - and can't - understand why it happened. And whilst I have other, wonderful, friends I just don't gel with them in the same way. 

I'm angry with her for cutting me out of her life so ruthlessly, and I hate myself for missing her as much as I do. It's a very similar grief to ending a romantic relationship and, in a way, it's worse; we enter romantic relationships understanding that it might sour one day, but you expect good friendships to last a lifetime.

I wish more people would talk about how horrible it is to lose a friendship. It's hard enough as it is without feeling so alone in it all."

Near the end when we could work again, I was drugged, taken to an unknown home, than found in a lawn - I was incoherent, frothing at the mouth, and BAC was .35 - I didn’t know where I was, how I got there.

Filed a police report within a couple days of discharge - detective judged my alcohol abuse, harped on my mental health (pointing out my self harm scars repeatedly) and dismissed me as I had “no proof” insisting this would go nowhere.

I try to support someone who is Asian/a person of colour? I get called white and racist and a cracker and a ""fake asian"" and whiny and entitled and ""not part of this conversation"". I try to support someone that's white? I get called slurs and told to go back to where I came from and told I'm ""not part of this conversation"". 

I get bullied in school and discriminated against for being darker and having more hair than most people I'm around and told off for wearing henna and called racist names, but then I surround myself with Asian people (friends and family) and I get called that one white girl, the one who isn't the pure Asian, the one who didn't grow up in a fully Asian household, the one who wasn't born in their Asian country, the one who isn't a real Asian because she can't speak her language very well, the whitewashed one. 

I'm sick of it. When will people realise that mixed people get shit from both races. Both races we're supposed to be a part of. People refuse to let us into their monoracial communities because we're mixed. We're constantly excluded because we're mixed. Our struggles are completely invalidated, ESPECIALLY by people of colour, because they say we're ""too white"" and ""still privileged"" and ""more white than us"" and ""not even a full person of colour"" and ""not going through the same racial abuse as us"".

Yes we fucking are. We get shit from everyone. At least monoracial people are embraced by most of their community. 

We're rejected.

It makes us wish we weren't born as a mixed person, would have been easier as a person of just one race."

There's a lack of urgency when it comes to student affairs. I got accepted the summer of 2021, NO ONE reached out to me to set up anything; emails, financial aid, choosing courses, requirements etc. I reached out several times and NO ONE ever responded. It was literally 2 weeks before classes started someone got back to me. I literally had to get everything done in those two weeks before starting my program. 

My program also required me to complete a titer blood test to ensure that I am still immune to vaccines. Guess what? I wasn't immune to every vaccine, I was taking shots back to back and still couldn't start my program because of other requirements. So ended up paying for a class I didn't complete for some of the month of August, the whole month of September, and some of October because of them. Once I completed the requirements I literally have been playing catch up. (I wasn't the only student with this problem) 

The professors are horrible too they never answer emails and was one of the reasons why me starting my classes dragged out to be so long. There's a lack of communication and a lot of carelessness. 

UConn is overpriced for no reason at all, I paid for 6k for an internship class. I'm paying 6k to work for free and it's insane. I paid for Western Conn out of pocket and one course costed me 2k. The program is eh, all the things that were taught I already knew so it wasn't anything mind blowing. It's frustrated that schools like UCONN get all this hype and are truly a disappointment. I'm honestly thinking about dropping out. I wouldn't recommend the school to anyone."

Hi there! 
i've been struggling with knowing if i reacted too strongly so here we go;

I (F16), have had a friend (F16) for about 4 years maybe. I did absolutely everything for her, and praised her like she was some sort of god. Bought her her favorite candy whenever she was sad, I used to come by every single day, supported her through everything, stood up for her when she needed it, wrote her letters, bought her, her mom and her brother christmas presents, listened to everything etc etc. 
Let's call her Emma.
Emma never gave me back any of the energy I gave her. She took all my support but when I got sexually assaulted (this happened two times) she ignored me and said she had too much to think about. I had a boyfriend for a little while, and he isolated me. Emma however, only complained afterwards about me not asking her to hang out often anymore meanwhile SHE didn't even try to ask me once. 
Emma has a boyfriend (M17) now (let's call him Jake), a boy who used to be my best friend too but made jokes about me going to kill myself so I dont really like him. They always say mean things about me like 'your birthday was so boring I left out of boredom' even though my parents and me tried really hard to make it fun.

So, Jake is throwing a party at his, for new years eve. Jake's house is a 1,5 hour bike from my place and Emma's place. Emma and me decided to bike together so that we don't have to go alone. (it's not too safe because half of the path i have to bike is dark)
Later, Emma texted me;

'are your parents driving you?'

her mom doesn't have a car, so she often drives w me to parties.

i answered:

'yes my mom is okay with driving me'

so she texted me back with:

'ok cool, can i come along because i'm sleeping over so i can ask jake's parents to bring me home'

i didn't understand so i asked:

'oh at Jake's'

she answered:

'yep'

i got nauseous and asked:

'so if we biked i would have to go home alone at night?'

this is where i got mad.

she answered with:

'no you could sleep over at *friend of Jake's i don't know* or you could bike home with *friend of Jake's who is known to sexually assault women*'

at this point got furious. how could she care this little?

'my parents wouldn't like that lmao' i answered

then she responded with:

'haha no i know but you could've done that'

My parents are driving me and picking me up, and i am never speaking to her ever again.

Even my family, knowing my struggle with an eating disorder, chooses to comment on the foods I have eaten in the past fully knowing that I sometimes have very little control of the things I eat. At least in my case, and some others I know of, we know what we should and shouldn't eat and it's mainly just a matter of if I am able to stop myself from eating other things in excess. If you were once able to lose 20 pounds to get your summer body or whatever you telling me to ""cut out carbs"" does not help. 98% of the time your situation is not the same as someone else's and your advice is more harmful than helpful. 

I don't really have a goal with this I just needed to say it. And if this is something you do under the guise of ""being helpful"" I implore you to stop."

My friend and I, both late 20s, only met 4 years ago and became close really quickly. I come from a working class, paycheck to paycheck background. My parents are immigrants. Her family isn't absurdly wealthy, but solid upper middle class and all the usual trappings - big house, college and car paid for, etc.  
 

My friend is genuinely very caring, kind, overall a wonderful human being, but I'm beginning to realize that she's also spoiled and entitled in such a way that I'm losing respect for her, and I absolutely hate myself for my negative thoughts about her. I feel like an awful friend.   
 

She graduated w/ an Arts degree, and she's an aspiring painter/musician. She hasn't worked much since graduating college 4 years ago, has mostly been living with her parents and sporadically working on her art. She complains about not having much spending money (her basic living costs are obv covered with her parents), but even pre-pandemic, was extremely reluctant to go get a job that wasn't ""in her field"".   
 

Which was fine, until the day I suggested that maybe, just for something to do and to have some extra cash, she could look into a part-time retail job. She looked at me like I was nuts, went on a rant about how easily she tires, how hard it is for her to wake up early for something that she isn't passionate about and which pays so little. All I could think about was my parents, waking up at 6am for years and years, to work service industry jobs that they didn't give a crap about, and that's when it hit me: on some level, she believes that these jobs and what they pay are beneath her. I guess because she has a college degree and grew up in a house with a pool?  
 

She's taken every opportunity to nab benefits meant for people in hard times, the people who do the jobs she won't touch with a 10-foot pole: she tried to apply for food stamps once because her parents weren't buying the organic foods she wanted, she rode the COVID unemployment train for as long as possible (qualified on a lucky technicality with an old job at the beginning of the pandemic), she managed to secure a living stipend for low-income students from our old college by telling them that she wasn't employed. To be clear, I'm 100% behind social welfare benefits and safety nets, tax me all you want for em. But for a woman in her late 20s who lives with her folks and makes art TikToks a few times a month?   
 

If I'm being really honest, I think the big issue is that she's become used to having things fall into her lap, and doesn't meaningfully understand a world in which that's not the case (my world), and for all her left-leaning, anti-capitalist speeches, she probably doesn't want to live in a world where she can't coast by on the labor of other people.   
 

I don't know how to talk to her about any of this, I doubt she would be receptive and would probably think that I'm attacking her. I still care for her and don't wanna lose her as a friend, but I don't know how to reconcile this. On a more practical note, I feel awful but I just cannot listen to her tone-deaf complaints about her circumstances any more. If you want more money for organic cheese, you get a job. That's what the rest of us do."

There is a large age difference between us, more than 10 years. I never said anything because when I was a kid I didn’t want to get in trouble. Then as I understood what actually happened I felt ashamed and guilty. 

I would even say that I loved my brother, but as the years went on I grew more and more bitter. Moreover he got involved with drugs, meth. He kept my family constantly worried, my poor parents did everything they could for him. Rehabs, bail, cars, money, they understand now that they were enabling but he still fucks up all the time. For a good seven years he was doing fine. Got married (no kids both are unable to have them) and this life seemed to turn him around. But he had a bad day and spiraled down. Stole some of my parents’ property and got arrested. 

Nowadays I just have nothing but contempt for him but I still wear a mask of filial love. I have to act like I like him, love him but I’m just so done with him. He’s raped me, stolen from us, done drugs and has just been a shitty human in general. I’ve wanted to kill him many times, but the thought of how my parents would react, and all the pain of realizing what they have done to me by keeping me with that monster for so long. 

My Dad is dead, died not too long ago. I worry that when my mom dies I really will kill him."

I’m sick of being “other” than every woman on this planet. I regret opening our marriage in an effort to set myself aside as a wife because all I hear is men lamenting about how stuck up their wives are.

More or less I was pampered a lot during my childhood and that kind of made it difficult for me to fit in the society. My mom, my grandmother & my aunt pampered me excessively. I don't have any siblings.

But the thing is, that I left my home for good in 2010. I went to college, I stayed in a dorm with roommates. I came to America and rented an apartment and stayed with a bunch of people. Worked a part-time job. Got a master's degree. Worked as an Intern. And I have been working since then for close to 5 years now.

But in all of these 12 or so years, the thing that I am struggling with the most is working with people. People are illtreating me everywhere I go. People don't answer my questions. People yell at me in public. On several occasions, a store clerk at Walmart, USPS, Duane Rede threw objects in my general direction. People at work cut me off while I am talking. People take derisively about my work in front of me. People chastise me, treat me like a child. On several occasions, I broke down and cried at work. There were several days when I came back home and stayed up all night crying.

I used to love writing software and working as a software engineer was my dream job and now I just hate it so much. I am struggling to finish the projects that are assigned to me because people are absolutely not helpful. They don't answer my questions. They blame me when things break. People are saying that I am adamant. When the thing is people don't answer my questions and force me to make decisions on my own. I am more than willing to listen to these people. I am not a fucking mind reader. My team leads have never been helpful ever. Most of the time they join in with my teammates in bullying me. I don't have any friends. I feel lonely and helpless."

It’s supposed to be my parents, my little sister (21 YO), and me. I told them my rules are for my house to be clean, no smoking (my dad is the only one that smokes), & pretty much respect the house. I became so strict because when I used to live with my dad and 2 sisters, they didn’t clean much and I was left to clean most of the time. Since I’m a travel nurse, I only stay in this house for 2-3 months more or less. Before I moved in, my sister is the only one that was living with me. While I was away, my parents moved in. A month later, my older sister & my nephew moved in my house also, which wasn’t part of the plan. I didn’t mind since I felt bad for them at the time. Now that I’m back for a break, I feel so unhappy that they’re here! Here’s the reason:
1. Most of them do not clean, except for my mom. She pretty much clean everything. All their rooms are messy! My dad smokes in his room as well. 
2. My little sister doesn’t clean the cat litter, so my mom and I have to do it. Her excuse is work, but we all work! 
3. my mom sleeps in the closet that is connected to my room, so I don’t even get my privacy. My dad and my mom don’t sleep together btw. My mom usually sleeps in my room, which is the master, but she doesn’t have any room right now. I told her I can talk to my older sister about it, but my mom claims that she doesn’t mind and likes sleeping there because it’s so dark and she works night shift, so that’s very important to her. I don’t really believe that though, which pisses me off since she’s the one that cleans the most! It’s also inconvenient for me because my clothes are in that closet and I have to be quiet since she sleeps during the day. I also want my privacy as well, but I don’t even have that since my mom can easily go in my room.

I’m about to leave in a couple of days for work and will be gone for 4 months. It’s sad that I feel unhappy coming back to my own house. I pay the mortgage, HOA’s, & their phone bills. They pay for utilities and food.I’m always in the crappy mood and feel like I’m about to explode. I’m supposed to be relaxing during my break. Also, PRIVACY is very important to me, so that’s why master bedroom to myself is important since I’m 27, but I can’t even get that. Any advice?"

In elementary school, there was a kid we'll call Miguel in this story. He was the absolute worst to me and would relentlessly bully me, trash my locker, make fun of my dad for being in rehab, shoving me to the floor everyday, etc. I hated him, and wished I could just get rid of him forever.

After grade 8, I was happy, thinking Miguel was gone for good, but once I got into high school, I saw that he was also in the same school again. He didn't bully me the same way, but he threatened to kill me if I told anyone about what he did in elementary. For the first semester in this school, I was haunted.

I once read that if you drink eyedrops, you could get very sick, and I had eyedrops from my last eye doctors appointment, so I thought this was the only way to get back at him for what he did. We had a lockdown during lunch and were forced to eat lunch in the class that we were in at the time, which was a class that me and Miguel were both in. I saw that he was eating pizza, and I figured now's my chance.

He went into his bag, and everyone else was distracted from stuff, so I then poured the entire bottle of my eyedrops onto his pizza, went back to my table and watched him eat the pizza. An hour later, he started feeling badly sick, then was brought home (and to the hospital I assume). 2 days pass, I learn that he died in his sleep with no way to figure out what happened.

This was 5 years ago, not a day goes by without me wishing I could take it back. Don't poison people with eyedrops, it'll most likely kill them."

And maybe that prompted people to have high aspirations about me. I have been academically oriented since young and recently in these past few years, I have made quite many decisions that turned my life around.

I met my bf(17m) when we were 15 and during then only I started observing people rather than having my nose in the books 24/7. And holy cow, I realised that I could start living my life the way I want sooner or later. With time, I started loving the new me. I started going out and grooming myself and making friends and spending time doing things I genuinely like. I still had some constraints when at home and usually I didn't protest because I didn't want any unnecessary fights or tears.

Today I'm at such a stage in life, where while I do value my education, I value my mental health more. I don't find it wrong to bunk classes to visit the zoo when I feel down for some reason, nor do I find it wrong to have that extra midnight hour to watch a movie. But all of this I had done when I was in my school city, I'm now with my parents for vacation and for no strange reason, I feel sad and desperate to get back. Its not like my parents are too strict or something, I just prefer to be private about things I wish to do that makes me happy.

Tomorrow my friends have invited me for a new year party, its super late at night and my dad is known to have childish tantrums over things that I tend to avoid. But I really want to go and meet my old friends tomorrow (from my prev school) and I have this endless war going in my mind if to raise this topic in front of them or not. My bf says that I'll never know if I don't ask them but knowing my parents, there are quite some horrifying reactions I can imagine. I just hope they trust me and let me be responsible for myself."

He just tested positive for COVID. I'm extremely upset.",2,3,1640889393.0,"Background: I'm a college freshman in Texas; I go back to school from break this Sunday. I'm triple vaxxed (just got my booster this past Monday), and I had COVID in the past when I was double vaxxed. My roommate is type-1 diabetic and not vaxxed yet. A guy I'm very close and intimate with on campus is double vaxxed, but also severely immunocompromised, with latent TB. My father, an orthopedic surgeon assistant, got double vaxxed, as everyone in our family initially did. He refused to get the booster, stating his immune system is strong enough. He will not wear his mask anywhere. He says he can't get COVID because he's vaxxed, even though he knows I did and went through hell when I had it.

This morning he got his results back, and it was positive; my mom got tested the same day and it came back negative. My mother, a nurse, was in the room he's isolating in for the entire day while we waited for results, but is now walking around the house wearing a mask since she's showing no symptoms. I have avoided both of them since my dad started feeling bad. I will not let either of them near me or touch me. I am keeping to myself. I haven't had close contact with either of them for at least 15 minutes at closer than 6 feet.

My brother kept making jokes about me being cautious, and my mom seems offended that I don't want her near me since she was so close to my dad for so long. I cannot afford to give my immunocompromised friends COVID; there is a good chance my friend's TB could very well turn active if he gets it.

I'm extremely upset at my dad for no other reason than the fact that he is purposely careless. How are you going to work in the healthcare field and not take basic precautions? My first three days of class when I get back are asynchronous, so I am getting tested on campus on Monday. I just am so upset that I was doing everything I could to be safe after having COVID once, only to be stuck in this household the week I go back. I was so close to having a decent break.

TLDR; my dad got COVID due to his own carelessness and it seems my parents don't understand why I'm so worried about potentially spreading it to my immunocompromised friends, despite working in the healthcare field."

I have pierced nipples as well to try to make myself love them more and it helps, but what didn't help was how much my bf didn't like them at first (and told me) and yet he watches porn with women with piercings. He's okay with them now, but the damage is done.

The last five years however, have been hell on him, mentally. He’s come down with tuberculosis, kidney issues, balance issues, muscle degeneration, and he’s barely able to walk. Oh, and his teeth are mostly gone.

It’s about half past 2 in the morning now, and we’ve just cleaned up after he puked for the third time tonight. He’s had fainting spells from low blood pressure multiple times in the last 10 days. About a week ago, he pulled my dad in and just said “my days are numbered.” I honestly think he’s given up on living, just because of all the health issues in the last five years that have affected him (most of which he’s recovered from, I should add).

I should clarify, the man’s never been a fatalist, he’s actually been one of the most upbeat people I’ve ever known. But this last week has been very clearly scaring my dad and I’m not sure how to help him cope with the fear of losing his father. I suppose it’s a small comfort to him that he’s able to have granddad here with us in Singapore. I understand the fear, I experience it everytime either one of my parents falls ill, because I’ve been living on the other side of the planet for the last five years.

Apologies for the disjointed writing, it’s just really late, but I had to get this out of my head.

I think it’s fair to say she is emotionally dependent on me and has been since my dad left when I was about ten. She absolutely adores me, which I really do appreciate as so many people have abusive and neglectful parents, I really haven’t had it that bad. But she has a way of making me feel intensely guilty if I don’t see her often enough (I already see her a few times a week), or don’t respond to her messages. 

She messages me about the most menial things a few times a day, and I feel like she does it to rope me into aimless conversation about nothing of any importance, and it would continue all day if I allowed it. She will ask what I’m up to, I will tell her I’m doing something, I will get another message an hour later asking if I’ve finished doing said task. I have an intense job, and struggle with my mental health, I need space and down time or I spiral into a state of misery. 

She always offers me support, but I feel like she contributes to my stress rather than alleviates it. She has incredibly high expectations of me, always tries to tell me what to do, and if I don’t do it tells me I’m stupid and not helping myself. She is constantly trying to fix me, doesn’t give me space, invalidates my struggles etc. I can look after myself, I know myself better than anyone, it’s just good to talk about how I’m feeling, but I just can’t with her. Seriously, I feel like, god forbid, if I got cancer I wouldn’t want to tell her because I would have to nurse her through me being ill! 

She has no relationship with my sister because she finds her controlling and cut ties. My mum is upset and angry about this, but because I’m the only daughter she has a relationship with I need to make up for it, and it makes stating my boundaries so much more difficult, and she is now way more sensitive to me needing space. 

She is happily married so she’s not lonely, but I still feel guilty for feeling this way. I don’t think she has done anything bad enough for me to properly confront her about it, she would be so upset to think that I don’t think she’s the perfect parent. So I guess I just have to try and find a way to manage it."

But one thing which annoys me is the way people use the rich vs poor ""debate"" as a rhetorical device. Want something to stop? Well then, whip everyone into a frenzy about how only ""rich"" people do it. I was considering installing solar but apparently rich people use solar to steal from the poor according to regulators wanting more money from solar using homeowners, so it may be too expensive for me to install now. Mega backdoor Roth IRA contributions I used before the pandemic? For the rich, yes, saving for retirement makes you rich, let's stop those. On and on and on.


I do feel like wealth disparity is a pretty bad problem in the USA but these things are not solutions. Solutions might be mixing school children into different, richer, districts so the poor neighborhoods don't stay poor. Funding poor communities so they have better schools, paying teachers more so teachers are better. Maternity leave for working single mothers. But these things are expensive and hard, it's easier to just whip people into a frenzy over something that won't solve the root of the problem. That's a problem because people think by agreeing to such rhetoric they are solving the wealth gap. But it solves nothing while the gap continues to grow.

And rich is relative. If you're in the USA and poor but you told a Polish person you lived in a 1100 sq ft place they'd laugh, that's huge for them. Or you have a clothes dryer, garbage disposal? Luxury, rich. I remember sitting in Poland watching ""poor"" Americans with giant houses bigger than my 700sq ft apartment my wife and two kids lived in, complain about how poor they were. 

You may think you're poor because your neighbor has a boat but then if you look at what you have, that's quite a bit. I mean to be able to flip a switch and grind your food down the drain so you're not some peasant reaching into the sink to grab wet chunks of food is pretty luxurious.

And also, is being rich that bad? I have one childhood friend who created his own website and sold it for $10M. His parents are not rich. He doesn't have to work anymore. Another friend who didn't care about college, never went, and just wanted to party and joke about all the girls he had sex with, he is rich thanks to marrying the right woman, that is, her dad is rich and he slept with the right coworker. He tours the world with his wife and two kids.  Another person I know saved while working a blue collar job and retired early. I'm not going to say who I think is a ""good"" or ""bad"" rich person. Only thing I can say about this is, it's a grey area. And I'm not swayed when people talk about ""the rich""."

I actually took care of my own feelings, faced the dragon of death, looked him in the eye and accepted any outcome in peace. I have a 2 year old daughter and I also cried for her, worried and then got to the point of accepting she may not get to have a mom, in peace.

I feel I did what I had to do, what I was asked to do. I took this chance to heal from past wounds, learn to love life and to not take anything for granted. I was grateful every day just for not feeling like crap, even if there was still a chance I could die from this. I felt lucky I was alive at all.

Now that I know I have a second chance I feel anxious. I don't want to ruin it for myself. I don't want to ruin it for my girl. I want to be joyous and live every moment. And yet. I feel I'm not asking for too much. Is it too much to ask to have someone want to spend time with me to celebrate that I'm alive? Is it too much to ask to have someone want to spend new years eve with me because they are so happy and relieved I'm still here?

What else is there for me to learn? I have already learned that no matter what you do, you can still end up alone. I have already learned to be happy on my own, I already love myself. So why can't I have anyone who loves me even half as much, enough to just choose to be with me to celebrate?

For those who think having a daughter is enough, I challenge you: children are meant to receive our love, not protect us or take care of us. I will never put that burden on her as my parents did with me. 

All I want is an equal. Someone who would do for me what I have done for many before, what I do for my daughter and what I am doing for myself. Be close and present."

I (F17) and my best friend (F17) have been friends since 2nd grade. I moved in 7th grade and we've had ups and downs ever since. Usually things go well but we will have arguments but we always make up. 

I've always thought that we had a friendship that we could come to each other and rant about whatever BS we've got going on. I've always told her that she can come to me for anything and she always has. There's been times where she'll just rant to me for hours, and I do the same to her. 

Lately we've been drifting. I say lately but to be honest it probably started about 2 years ago. She finally opened up to me about stuff going on at home and told me about how her friends would say things to her that upset her. I told her that I would be there for her but she told me that ""I just wasn't the person who could be there for her."" And that really hurt. 

Time passed and we made up after that and then there was a time where we said we never talked on FaceTime so let's set up a whole day where we just do nothing but FaceTime. So that day I wake up and nothing. I didn't get a text until 3 PM after I texted her. She just said her mom made her do something and she was busy. Of course I wasn't upset at her for being busy, but I was upset because I literally cleared my entire schedule to talk to her and I didn't get one ""hey, something came up text."" She told me she just forgot. 
Yesterday I hadn't gotten a text in about 5 days. I know that sounds bad but I really haven't been in a great place because I've just moved and I don't have a whole lot of friends yet. I texted her and asked to FaceTime and she was with friends. Of course I'm happy that she's with friends, but I do often feel that I'm second to those friends. It wouldn't upset me if she hadn't previously expressed discomfort when I had friends other than her, or when I asked if I could be friends with hers and she didn't want to introduce me to them, but begged when I made friends after I moved for me to introduce her to them. There was also a time where I moved less than three hours away from her. I offered to come and get her and drop her off so nothing would be hard on her parents because I wanted to see her. She told me her mom said no. Okay, fair enough, except when we FaceTime afterwards her mom walks in and starts talking to me. She had no idea I had moved so close. 
So, yesterday I told her that I was upset. that I missed talking to her because I've been feeling pretty alone here recently. Her friend took her phone and just absolutely went off on me. Told me I should stop trauma dumping, that I was an awful friend, and that I didn't deserve her. She said that she has always been an amazing friends and has never done me wrong and that I have done nothing but hurt her. I just. I didn't know what to say. I told this friend of hers that she has no say in our friendship because she doesn't know both sides and it not fair to me for her to only look at her side. Not to mention this was the very friend that my friend has cried about before. She told be that she told her ""everything"" and that we need to take a break. So I said okay. She said that she doesn't believe that I'll leave her alone so I told her she can just block me and unblock me when she's ready if she doesn't believe I won't text her. The conversation ended and I just sobbed to be honest. I went on every platform I had her on and unfriended her and honestly it felt really good, like a weight was off of my shoulders. At this point I think that friendship was just us saying we were friends. Anyway, not she can only contact me if she texts me. She said she ""need a week"" but I don't know if I'll be ready in a week."

I have people coming into my work to shop and informing me we should be giving them product at certain prices. That I should take back their unused perishable product purchased months ago because they don’t use it that much. I had someone ask if they could cut in line while I’m with a customer because they have things to do. While I’m with the customer! Mind you my work is purely recreational. No one needs anything from it.

Whatever it’s just work right? Those are things you deal with at work.

Enter every day life.

I walk into the grocery store and am greeted by anti mask/antivaxxers fighting with store employees over mandates. Those people are also yelling at innocent bystanders who are following the rules and have their families with them.

People driving is an example most of us can refer to everyday. People pulling off wild stunts and cutting people off just to get a few more feet closer to the front of the line. Risking peoples lives for nothing most of the time.

I’m on a few dating sites, a place you go when you admit you’re not doing well at the in person game, and some of these people…holy shit. You would think you were in the presence of royalty. People who are complete trash putting it on you to compete for them like it’s an Ivy League school entrance exam. 

Everyone is just shouting over each other and not hearing a word being said including their own words. 

I have never appreciated more the people who are humble, have manners, and mind their own business. You people are angels and deserve better."

But luckily I did. 

She’s working at this small restaurant and I keep going but she doesn’t know it’s me. We talk sometimes. And she seems like a nice lady.

If you are paid and not beaten or verbally assaulted and can leave to go home at the agreed upon time, that’s a job. Any other shitty things that may be a part of that job that makes it a shitty job, but it’s still way better than slavery. And you know who’s job has pretty much no shitty things about it?

I’m trying so hard to make friends and improve my relationship with my family. I’m trying to be a better person, communicate better, be more open and trusting. 

But as much as my family cares about me and wants to spend time with me, I find them exhausting to be around. One of my siblings came and stayed with me for Christmas and it was overwhelming. I did everything I could to make it a special and fun time for them, but I couldn’t shake my attitude of just wanting to have time and space for myself. Now of course, as soon as they’re gone I feel lonely and guilty for not being able to just accept their affection and enthusiasm without feeling nauseous and and suffocated. 

I made some new connections with people this year, but I’m low priority for all of them. And of course right now everyone is with their close friends and family. So I’m alone in a big city and I just realised with all the planning for Christmas I didn’t make any plans for new year. 

So I’ll be alone for New Year’s Eve with no parties to go to and no one to celebrate with. And all because I don’t manage to genuinely connect with anyone or make plans in time. 

I’m so tired of being in my own head, and ricochetting between desperate loneliness and wanting to be alone. 
I feel like I’ll never be able to have a close friend or partner because I get overwhelmed and push people away, no matter how hard I try to have a better balance. 

I just want to be able to relate to others like a normal person, and have friends and be able to make decisions and plans and just go have fun instead of wallowing in guilt and despair all the time. 

Why am I such a shit person and why is it so hard to do better?"

the context: i ran out of my antianxiety/depressants two days ago and drove an hour after being on the phone with a nurse who had told me to come yesterday or today for an appointment to get a refill to last me until my med appointment. only to get to the doctor to be told that the dr was booked and i drove an hour for no reason AND i won’t have any meds for a week to a month. 

so obviously i’m frustrated and anxious and pissed, i call my bf at work to tell him. apparently he’s had a shit day at work and gets mad at me for being upset bc i can’t go when they have appointments bc i work 6am to 5pm and yknow. it’s an hour away. i’m out of points (actually over but that’s not the point) so i can’t even call out on tuesday to go to said appointment. 

he starts saying “it’s your fault you have points, you go home bc you don’t feel good in the morning, take a nap and feel fine the rest of the day.” he always says “i’m not trying to be an asshole but like-“ but like it kinda feels like you’re being an asshole rn. 

so after i barely explain why i can’t get my meds he starts going on about why his work day is so shit. and obviously i care but atm i kinda feel like the fact that i won’t have medicine that helps me function like a normal human being is a bit more important and i shouldn’t be getting told to “calm down so i can actually understand you, i’m not in the mood for the whiny stuff today, i’ve had a shit day at work” when i’m literally about to start sobbing thinking about the next month of my mental health. 

anyways. that’s my vent. i feel a bit better now bc this has happened a few times in the past 2.5 years and it always feels like when both of us are in a bad mood, his bad mood trumps mine and i have to suck up my bad mood to comfort him. i get i complain quite a bit but like. he does too, especially when it comes to bad days at work."

My grades aren't the best right now, and I'm trying to fix, but when they ask about it, I'll say I'll do later. And my dad will be like there goes captain procrastinator. I don't need someone constantly reminding me I need to do my homework. I know the smart thing to do is get the stuff done, but STOP TELLING ME STUFF I ALREADY KNOW.

I have a video that I have to send in that's kind of important and it's due tomorrow on Dec 31. I was going to do it today and hopefully have my mom help me, but noooo she's saying that I'm probably going to procrastinate until tomorrow and that I shouldn't have waited this long. And that she bets(not betting money, just highly expecting it) I'm going to wait til tomorrow to submit it. I know I had a month to do it, but the it just felt busy and I thought today was going to be a relaxed day, but now I'm just pissed.

I know I should just do the work and chores like I'm suppose to , but I'm just letting this out."

I live with my ex (strange, yes). We got into a relationship years ago, broke off like 2 years ago. Still, kept in touch as she had no friends. Also, her family was super abusive (words I cannot write here). I supported her throughout, helped her to get a (very good, with 600% hike) job, always was there for her whenever she needed. 

5 months ago, I finally got her out of her hell home, to a new city where our jobs are. We planned to stay together for few months and then part ways of course. She wanted my help with career and stuff. And I understood that coming out of an abusive home won't be easy for her. So I am here, trying to support her continuously. I clean, I cook, I do everything of household. 

She just lies in her bed all day long. Takes a bath at random times like 2 AM or 10 PM. Eats food if I serve her to bed or she orders online. She works like 1 hour a day on her full time job and keeps saying how others are getting ahead of her. She puts no effort in making her life better in any sense but continuously cribs.

As far as I understand, she has some depression. Or I don't know. But the effect is that, I get shouted upon all day long. If I don't bring her water, she doesn't talk to me. If I say something, I get shouts in return. All kind of abuse I feel - mental and verbal. I get blame for everything - including random people getting random jobs or being promoted, or the bad quality products of Amazon order. Like everything is my fault.

If I work by 10 hours of job, she says I never give her time to help her with her career. So I just do my meetings now, that too not qll. My job performance has reduced coz all the possible time, I put on her. She doesn't understand that she needs help, she has to ask for it when I am free. But when I am free, she just uses Instagram and shouts at me. If I talk to people reporting to me and explain them something, she says I can find time for others but not for her. And at the end, she puts zero effort in her work.

Things like this continue day in and day out.

She asked me to move out (coz as per her, it's all my fault), I agreed. I will move out in few days. She makes a drama about that every day.

But I am afraid. I am afraid how she will live by herself. She doesn't do a single thing currently, how will she live alone? When I came back after a week, the house was super dirty, with all ordered foods thrown to the side of the bed and in her room. All the utensils had started getting worms in it.

So I don't know what to do. It might be best for me to move out, to get rid of all emotional torture. But I am dead worried about her. She doesn't even want to talk. I asked her to see someone for counseling, but the result was she shouting at me for calling her mad. 

I want the best for her - I don't know if that's in being here and helping her, or getting out and letting her take care of herself.

TLDR; I am worried about my depressed/abusive ex and don't know what to do."

While practicing today, things got really heated up and we kept losing. Despite following the steps religiously of whatever they planned out, I got yelled at and shamed terribly by my bf (he usually doesnt do that to that degree) despite already confiding to him the other day about how i felt about it. While he critiqued me, his friends all quietened down on chat, i guess they felt awkward.

I get that the heat of the game is normal in team matches, but the panic was real and i tried so hard to stop myself from crying because the tears can block my view and i will screw up even more but i couldnt. Eventually we started winning and he calmed down and started poking fun/making jokes at me like nothing happened. I didnt reply back as i didnt want the whole world to know that i was crying and kept silent for the rest of the matches.

After we ended, he apologised to me and explained that he was trying his very best to calm himself down for scolding me. He did ask why i was quiet during the matches and i told him again, that i was actually crying because i felt stressed out about him yelling at me. He said he knows hes at fault and just needed a mental break. Without any ill intentions, i changed the subject and casually said ""seeya tmr at <time> for the competition"" and he asked why i was being passive aggressive against him. 

I told him i wasnt being paggro and to at least give me a break if he has no mental energy to even comfort his gf who cried because of him. We had a truce and left the convo as it is. Is this normal for other people in my kind of situation? I just felt horrible because he doesnt react to me when i cry, in the past and present.

For game context, no, i wasnt the reason our whole team was losing. Matches are naturally unpredictable and takes a team to help each other out and score anyway.

tldr: i hate this game, i hate how my bf is treating me all over a game"

The years spent together have been good but I moved away 2 years ago and ever since the beginning of 2021 i feel like our friendship has gone down hill. 

I admit we have our fair share of toxic traits like I keep most things to myself instead of telling her or when I try and she doesn’t listen I get upset but i won’t say anything. Then when she talks about herself it’s always herself, no regards to how i’m doing. There were times I was so low and reached out to her and she was no help at all but when it’s her Im always there trying to help. 

Recently I started getting exhausted of her constant complaining about her life and her job but she does nothing about it.She even said her life felt like it was in a loop.  i tell her to quit and she says no. I tell her to find another job and she says she’s trying but she’s been saying that for months. She does nothing to make her life better and I do my best to encourage her that it takes a little effort. I had these same feelings too but i chose to just move forward. It’s like everytime we talk it’s the same thing with her, she focuses on the wrong things. I feel everything she’s going through i’ve already went through so I understand most of the time by what she means. But transitioning into adulthood wise we’re not on the same level. I don’t know how else to help her especially when I’m in a whole different state. There are days where I just want to stop speaking to her and focus on myself but then I think about how i don’t want to leave her behind. 

This was a vent I needed to get out but if you have any advice on how I can help her it would be appreciated."

He would get drunk and become violent and yell at me and urinate on me almost every single night of my life with him.

He came over Tuesday, demanded I give him custody of our special needs son so he can get on food stamps and when I laughed and called him crazy, he took to berating me in front of his drug addict gf and our son.

I have battered woman syndrome so I don't think clearly sometimes in terms of dealing with him. I always stand there and take it. It finally clicked with me that I don't have to take his abuse anymore. I've blocked his number and will keep it blocked. I told him I will call the police if he comes to my work.

But to be honest, people with different conditions (and even pregnant women, women trying to become pregnant, low income people will less access to proper and regular Healthcare) have expressed their concerns over the vaccine due to general distrust in american Healthcare (which, even though I'm vaccinated, as a brown girl I understand given America's clear disinterest in public health and history). 

And from the jump, questioning the vaccine has been demonized and people have gotten called names and been shamed for just questioning long term safety. As if it wasn't valid. I literally had blood circulation issues after the vaccine and it went away thankfully but my heart would hurt, my legs would fall asleep when I was standing, calf cramps would happen multiple times a day and last longer than usual, and when I talked about it online, people told me I was just fanning ""anti-vax flames"" by... saying what happened honestly? 

I always advocated for the vaccine, even with my own issues. Because on top of it all, I am a long hauler (had covid before vaccine was available). I still can't taste the same, I work out and my cardio is still sh*t, constantly congested like my symptoms never left. And my adhd/depression has worsened from habits gained over quarantine (not being able to go anywhere so mostly watching tv more, etc is not good for adhd because of over stimulation and I haven't seen some of my friends in what is going to be 2 years because some work in Healthcare)

So yeah, I would *love* everyone to get vaccinated and wear masks and lower the spread so I can maybe sometimes go outside of my home and socialize again. But they're not going to if you keep making them feel like their concerns are not valid. They aren't refusing the vaccine to be jerks. There is literal confusion. They literally feel fear over what the vaccine might do to them. 

So you're not going to bully them into taking it.

They don't trust the government. They don't trust the CDC (can you blame them???) And while some may trust science *inherently*, they don't trust the companies/systems that are backing the vaccines. And when everyone tries to hide all potential side effects, and shame people for being concerned at all, they will trust it even less.

Bottom line is do you want people vaccinated, or do you want to dunk on them online for moral egoism? Because I, for one, am tired at how bad everyone is at just speaking to people. If I was an anti-vaxxer, hearing ""I hope you rot in hell"" would literally not make me want to get vaccinated. Its very weird, honestly."

I always try to celebrate NYE to at least have the thought (or essence) that things will get better the following year but now that can't happen because a member of the house has covid. Sometimes I contemplate leaving everything behind but I'm not that kind of person especially with my daughter. Everything just keeps piling on and with me doing so.much for everyone else, I don't know even know who I am anymore."

rs33cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rs33cl/im_so_tired_tw/,I’m so tired (tw),1,0,1640874626.0,"- I graduated from college this past spring. I also quit my job in customer service to write full time at the encouragement of my mom. I’ve written maybe 5000 words of a book i’ve been working on since freshman year and when I do it’s always in bed. I don’t really get out of bed much anymore. 

- My mom had a conversation with a family friend and decided (without consulting anyone, my dad included) that we would be buying a new house and moving out of my childhood home of 22 years. I hate it. Since we’ve been here it’s been nothing but family drama and repairs to a house that was built in 2009. My baby sister spent Christmas morning wearing a mask because she caught covid at an elaborate Christmas party my mom threw the weekend before. She invited 60 people and expected it to go well. I don’t associate this house (because it’s definitely not my home) with anything positive. 

- I don’t know what I want to do with my life. It feels ridiculous to plan anything in advance when it feels like the world is ending every time I turn on the news. My parents have encouraged me to get an MFA so I’m humoring them and doing a couple of applications. It could be fun but most programs have <5% acceptance rate and I don’t think I’m extraordinary. 

- I’ve been trying to lose weight but I also have ARFID so it hasn’t been going well because my safe foods are not healthy. 

i’m so fucking tired of it all. I’m scared of hurting myself but I know my family would suffer because of it so I haven’t. They’re the only thing keeping me alive and I don’t treat them like they are. Any time we interact it’s always an argument about something political that I bring up or about my baby brother being a typical iPad kid."

Humans, usually not so much. I have reasons why I have been pushed into bitterness and solitude, and I can admit that I don't always feel bad for people if I feel like there's a reason why they were treated a certain way. It's animal abuse or slaughtering that makes me sad all day every day. Or the things that people do to train or use them.. or the effect on certain species due to climate change.

 I can't shake off the sadness I feel when I watch something bad happen to animals in a movie or read in a book or online, even hours and hours later. I am hesitant to watch new Disney or fiction fantasy movies now even though they're my favorite. For example I haven't and won't watch How to Train your Dragon because of the look on the dragon's face in the preview when he thought he was about to get slayed. I started crying when reading that Hedwig gets killed because as I grew up reading the Harry Potter books, *I* even got attached to hedwig I think. So many of the things that happened to other characters made me deeply sad too but that's the first one that stands out for some reason, and when the dragon that the goblins were abusing gets freed I cried ugly happy tears. I guess I have a theme of sensitivity towards dragons lol but I could give a million other examples too. 

I have made the decision a while ago to be completely vegan or 99% plant based.. when I accidentally have something that I find out had milk powder in it I'll immediately try to comfort myself thinking. ""Well if I didn't eat it, somebody else would have any way."" Which when I actually say those words out loud, it seems fucked.

I am venting about this because I just realized this morning how it does kind of take a toll on my physical state.. I had this random memory of being at a carnival that had pony rides but instead of an open track the ponies were in a circle pretty close behind each other, and knew when to stop and to go. It seemed like they were drugged or something. I felt my heart fluttering and my fingernails pressing into my hands and couldn't distract myself from the pain I felt, so I came to this in hopes that I'm not the only one who feels juvenile and defeated due to things like this. I even hate when fuckin plants die."

I can't go home I'm trapped at her flat.

When I was in year 5 at primary school (9 years old), I was a bit of a nerd and used to go to computer club after school. There were only a handful of us that went. The teacher was this guy that got brought in just for the club, since this was the early 2000's and I guess ICT expertise wasn't common for teachers to have at that time.

Anyway, he used to give us lessons then pick on people to answer questions about what we'd learn - ""What does RAM stand for"", that kind of thing. If you got it wrong, he'd say it was 'wedgie time' and we'd all laugh (including the victim) as he pulled their trousers up in a wedgie.

One time the guy asked me to stay behind after everyone else had gone to 'show me something'. He took me around to this nook in the classroom where you wouldn't be immediately visible from the windows or doorways, where he had this half built computer he had been taking apart and putting back together. He started asking me questions about the components that were strewn around on the table. He started with easy questions and gradually got up to stuff he hadn't taught us. I remember passing on one of the questions, but he told me I had to guess. I guessed something (wrong, obviously), and he grinned and said it was wedgie time. At this point, I still thought wedgie time was a fun game so I sort of turned around for him. But at this point, he said 'No, you have to do it properly.' I was confused and asked him what he meant, and he told me I had to take my trousers off. At this point I immediately sensed something was really wrong and just remember saying no, backing away, grabbing my coat and shoes from the cloakroom and running all the way home.

I didn't tell my parents or anyone at the school about what had happened, because I was always getting in trouble and genuinely not understanding why, so I was worried this would be another of those cases, so I just stayed quiet. I went back to the club a couple of times and I could tell the guy was scared, tried to bribe me with this cd he'd burned a load of games on.

Nothing really happened, so I don't feel like I'm traumatised or anything, but it is a bit sickening to think about, and I often wonder whether I should bother saying something almost 20 years later - what if he's still around doing this kind of thing to kids more 'successfully'.

Anyway, if you read all this, thanks."

May will be 2 years we’ve been together, and 4 months in it was great, but as time went on I found out my values and his values actually did not align. 

Now I am by no means shaming people who like to do the below, I just have no respect for people who lie continually that they aren’t going to something but continue to do them anyway.

At first, porn didn’t really bother me, but later I found out my boyfriend just how much he was watching it to get off, and I didn’t sit well with my any longer. Same with weed, he was smoking multiple times a day everyday of the week, and I just didn’t think that was healthy for him. 

I expressed to him how I felt about it and he said he would start limiting it. It still didn’t sit right with me and I expressed to him that I would like him to stop doing it because for me personally it is something I would like for me and my partner to abstain from so we build that sexual intimacy together. He promised me that he wouldn’t do it anymore. That was at the beginning of January. 

Fast forward to this past March, he did it again and a lot of it. Right before our trip to Florida to see his parents. 

I was absolutely devastated. The trust was broken, and I wanted to end things that day, but then as I took more time to think about it, we ended up staying together. 

I had experienced so much anxiety and depression throughout this relationship. Feeling like I couldn’t trust him, and eventually we went to counseling and things did get better. He stopped the porn, and he limited his weed to a comprise we shared. 

And then I just started feeling myself pull away. Instead of getting super anxious about worrying if he was watching porn I started to get apathetic.

Back in March I kept thinking I deserved better but couldn’t bare to say goodbye without giving it another fair chance. Then now after he lied to me about the weed he smoked on the days he said he wouldn’t had got me questioning it all again. 

I think it’s time we broke up. Because I can’t help wondering what my life would be like if I just moved on and waited for someone who is a better match for me values wise. I still love my boyfriend and will continue to love him, but I think fundamentally at the core of it we are just too different to get along.

My fiancé and I were going out to eat and I didn't want to ask but my fiance did, and he asked. “ why did you unfriend her on snap?” and he blamed it on his wife not knowing who I was. I wasn't gonna ask I wasn't even gonna mind it to be honest. But the crazy part is he added me back right then and there, and he had to get my snap off my fiancee's phone. I told him to just put me as (my fiancé’s name) wife. He said no it’s fine, I’ll just tell my wife. And then they had decided to come get a company vehicle from my fiancé’s home at 1240 at night. He was asleep in bed and they came to his house. I had also been told by someone they tried to bash my fiancé and call him a liar and say really bad things. This is all stupid.

 did i mention i’m only 16? 

this shit is rough and i really feel like giving up. i don’t know how to talk to my counselor to move on from trauma and certain shit. my brain just doesn’t process that’s what counselors are for and i won’t be judged. 

my memory is also very bad i don’t even realize my life and mental health issues are bad until it just randomly clicks in my brain like right now. i’m numb i can’t realize that i feel happiness when i do atleast because it’s all that i’m adjusted to. and i can’t feel for anyone. which also makes relationships way harder on me. which also gives me anxiety. i also get angry sometimes and don’t realize what i say. because i can’t feel how others feel when i say things. 

i try to work on myself and i have for months and things sometimes get better and then i just don’t acknowledge what i have to do to get better or just get really depressed 
 
i’m also very depressed and alone but i’m trying. i feel like i’m useless."

As a last minute effort my mother-in-law brought an old duplex house for all of us to live in that needs a lot of TLC. For her, the transition was easy. She changed her car plates, driver's license, insurance, locks, appliance, you name it, she most likely took care of it. But me nope. I got to the DMV to change my car plates from NY to Connecticut, denied! My car is leased so I need a power of attorney in order to get permission to ship the title to the main DMV office that's an hour and a half away from me. 
   Waited a month for the title to finally arrived at the DMV, made an appointment to go, when I finally get there, denied again! Why you ask? Because I'm not a policy holder to my auto insurance. My mother-in-law (both my parents are deceased) puts me as a driver and not a policy holder. I told her what happened and she told me she'll take care of it. Few months went by and me having ADHD, you kinda forget about these important things until you get a letter in the mail from the DMV saying they are gonna suspend your license plates in 2 weeks if you don't take care of this. 
    So she finally took care of the insurance issues, made an appointment to DMV and me hoping that a third time's a charm get DENIED AGAIN! WHY? BECAUSE THEY SEND BACK THE TITLE AND DELETED MY APPLICATION! Well since I'm here and my driver's license is gonna expire in a couple of weeks let's take care of that instead. ""Oh I'm sorry sir, we can't do that because your current driver's license doesn't match with your birth certificate (was born in Puerto Rico where they put both your parents name on you BC).

I've got Osteogenesis Imperfecta and I'm wheelchair bound. But it didn't have to be this way. My earliest years were filled with surgeries to fix specific issues with how my skeleton formed. When I started elementary school, I was periodically pulled out of class for short physical therapy sessions. 

But nobody, not a single person explained to me what I was doing or why, not in any way that clicked. At that point in my life, just about everything felt like it was happening *to* me, just a constant stream of other people doing things around me, and me being forced to go there, come back here, say this, *we'll do this for you.* It wasn't until I was 15 that I properly understood that I could make my own decisions. And I really do not think that that's a consequence of who I am, my neurology or what have you. I sincerely believe that it was the people around me that made me ignorant of extremely basic things up to that point.

My parents divorced when I was 5 or 6, and having to raise 5 other kids, my mother never had enough time with me, to get to know me, to get to understand that *I didn't understand* what this physical therapy shit was for. Again, it just seemed like another thing I was forced to do. I had to go to school, american public school in the early 2000's, which, everyone should know by now was and still is complete and utter shit. All this arbitrary nonesense that I wanted no part in, day after day, and considering that physical therapy took up only a small fraction of the things I was being forced to do, didn't make sense to me, and got harder over the years. I just never took to it.

I should be able to walk by now, I should have gotten to that point in my early teens, but I literally didn't understand. It never even occurred to me just how important it was until I had dropped out of high school and had time to my self, just free time that I could decide what to do with.

For reasons that didn't click until my adult life, people always seemed to want to do things for me, even though I knew I could do them myself. Even just getting off the floor or a couch and back onto my wheelchair. If there was someone around me they would try to ""help"", stick a hand out, touch me in some way they thought might help, try to stabilize my wheelchair, ask ""what do I need to do?"" Nothing, the answer is do nothing, I know my body and my wheelchair like you know your body and your balance, I have always been able to do those things myself. 

But saying; ""No, I got it."" just didn't seem to click with some people. Maybe half of said people probably thought I was being prideful, didn't want help because I didn't want to be pitied. The real answer is that I can mount my wheelchair in any context, provided my wheelchair is in fact on the floor and I have at least two functioning limbs. *Unless I'm being fucked with and my wheelchair is being held in place unexpectedly, especially in an awkward position* But I don't want to debate somebody about that when I'm just trying to get up off the couch.

And that's just one semi-common example of being called a liar when I was telling the truth. If the gummybear bones, the divorced parents, the emotional neglect didn't fuck me up, telling the truth and being called a liar for it **over and over** throughout my whole life sure did. (Some of those instances are too traumatic for my brain to remember, apparently.)

Human beings are fantastic creatures, we're impossibly complex. But we need time to develop, we need proper social connections, we need people to raise us, we need people to teach us what it means to be this bipedal fleshthing with eyes and brains and hands, what we can do, what's expected of us.  
Nobody prepared me to be the kind of creature that I am. Human, in all the most important ways, but defective in ways that mean I can't do the same things. Nobody knows what they can expect from me, nobody knows how to treat me. There's no guidebook for this, people like me aren't necessarily supposed to exist, we aren't planned for, so there's no set role for us to occupy.

Nobody knew what I was supposed to be, so they didn't raise me to be anything. Certainly not a functioning member of society."

I always wear my mask, am fully vaccinated, and have contracted a nasty case of Covid because of the carelessness of my family who has decided they are done with Covid so fuck who they infect along the way. I won’t go into detail, but for Christmas they had myself and my boyfriend over, and we were specifically told no one is sick and everyone was negative for Covid etc, come to find out multiple people were symptomatic, and even though I wore my mask the whole time, I now have covid for the second time. Just because you don’t give a shit doesn’t mean I don’t, so fuck everyone that is selfish enough to stop caring about a god damn global pandemic so they can party. Grow the hell up.

Update: Hi everyone, I just wanted to clarify something. In my original post, I did not mean to shame anyone for being saddened and frustrated by Covid. I am right there with you, and it is very tiresome to go through this pandemic. I only meant to express my frustration towards those who are not practicing safety measures(masks, vaccine, social distancing when symptomatic, etc). So if you’re tired of Covid but still practicing safety for yourself and others, you rock and this is in no way meant to be an attack on you."

Yesterday was my birthday and it sucked. I'm used to having terrible birthdays, since it is right in the middle of the holidays and usually nobody can be bothered. Most times my friends suggest celebrating my birthday either together with Christmas or on new year's eve. Over the last years I've made it very clear, that I want to separate my birthday from the holidays and want to do something that's not christmasy or new year's celebration in one. That's my big request for my friends, that my birthday not be lumped in together with everything else. One year I suggested celebrating a month later, so it would be easier and maybe they were in the mood to do something again, after the holidays were over. They thought it was silly and so it didn't happen.

My family has always been stressed out by the holidays and the 29th was a fabulous day for fights. Kitchen door left ajar? That was a fight for a whole day. Worst birthday was a year, when I was locked in my room, 'cause they wanted to do something special and I wasn't to ruin the surprise, so I couldn't leave my room until 4pm. The surprise was a cake they baked. To this day I have no idea what that was all about. I just remember being stuck in my room.

For the last two years my family hasn't been on speaking terms. There's an argument going round about the house my parents still live in and it's not pretty. In short, my siblings want the house, my parents still live in it and are very capable of taking care of themselves and the house and have no intention of signing it over just now, I kinda sided with my parents, saying it's their house, so it's their choice. Christmas has therefore already been horrible (many people not talking to each other), so I stayed away from everything for my birthday.

On Monday a couple of friends came over to have our Christmas celebration and exchange gifts. We've known each other for decades and usually all go in together for the gifts, so everybody but person X knows what person X will get and so on. We usually work off of wish lists or simply ask what someone wants for Christmas and that worked well over the last years. This year two friends didn't really want anything you can buy in a store, but one person (let's call her Abby) wants a new PC and needs someone to pick the parts, put it together and set it all up, while the other person (let's call her Jane) has an attic full of stuff and wants to remodel, so they asked for us to come over and help clean out all the stuff and help with the remodel.

Of course we all agreed that we would help them out with their requests. Even though they didn't ask for anything else, we all bought them something we knew they wanted for Christmas and gave it to them on Monday. They were quite surprised and really liked their gifts.

When it was time to open my gifts I discovered that my friends had selected two items from my wish list to get me for Christmas.

Here is where my ridiculousness starts. The two items amount to a price of about half of the gifts we got Abby and Jane, and maybe a quarter to what everyone else got. Usually when we pick the gifts we all take care, that we spend an equal amount on everyone. This was very obviously not the case, when it came to this years gifts. In the moment I was a bit shocked, but didn't say anything 'cause I didn't know what to say to be honest. At first I thought I might have been missing something, like a gift card or maybe a voucher, 'cause that's how we usually do it, when we can't get the things someone wishes for, but no, nothing.

After the celebration was over I went over to my wish list and decided to buy myself the book I was hoping to get for Christmas. That's when I noticed that two other items from my list had been removed, as in ""probably someone bought them for me"". I know which items they are and what they cost and well, I really can't help myself but it made me angry.

One friend got a 4 day vacation sponsored by all of us this year, another one got a new tablet and a one year pre-payed Netflix account for their birthday and I'll be getting two books.

Future tense, 'cause yesterday we didn't do anything for my birthday, as one friend wasn't in the mood for anything at all and another one had made a list of things they weren't up for, which only left going for coffee at a place I don't like, so I let them off the hook and instead ran necessary errands.

Right now I'm still pissed and don't wanna see them."
rryo5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rryo5t/my_sincere_thoughts_on_bilingualism/,My sincere thoughts on BILINGUALISM,12,21,1640860038.0,"TLDR: Someone disrespected me (again!) due to my English as a Second Language (ESL) accent. Nothing new but it seriously hurt. Today, I would like to respectfully say to them to GET OFF THEIR MONOLINGUISTIC HIGH HORSE and go FUCK themselves! ----- Venting + Sharing some sincere love with the ESL community at large! (My 1st post ever)

===

Preamble:

Life is beautiful in one language or many languages. I am not gatekeeping bilingualism or the level of proficiency you may have on your mother tongue, a second, a third, or a fourth language. This conversation begins with my perspective and is about my experiences and my experiences alone, as well as the attitudes and behaviours that throughout the years I have been the recipient of as an ESL speaker.

To:

The person who disrespected me and blessed me with their infinite intolerance and impatience a few days ago... I will tell you what it means to have an ESL accent:

It means I can DREAM, teach, think, write, study, sing, watch movies, read poetry and novels, have deep conversations, develop and defend worthy arguments, navigate complex situations, express my emotions, talk to my dog/cat, raise children, and tell my wife that I love her in a DIFFERENT language then (sic - lol) English.

It also means that occasionally I may mix basic expressions such as 'then' and 'than', but at least I can do it in two languages.

What is your excuse?!

You do not know me. And never will. But I will also tell you something about myself: every day, I spend most of my energy trying to align my English as a Second Language alter ego with my true self. And I often fail, because the obstacles presented by speaking ESL are far too great, far too taxing, far too complex, phonetically and pronunciation-wise, for someone who started to learn the language in their twenties.

You do not know me but you hurt me. And frankly, you have made me wish that I had arrived here earlier, so my brain would have had a little more elasticity and I could have learned to pronounce chip, ship, and cheap in rapid succession and not sound like I am just asking for Doritos each time.

So, what I am trying to say is fuck you, I guess.

I know characters you don't, sounds you don't, songs, expressions, foods, singers, actors, authors, artists, scientists, immensely kind and loving people, and a beautiful world that most likely you will never know or get to experience in its full grandiosity. Plus, I know around 15,000 to 20,000 more words than you do. Words which I (often and silently) have used to send you to hell. Oh! And believe me, many of these words are much more gloriously potent and satisfying than the word ""hell"".

My soul swells!

So, from the deepest confines of my broken heart and with the utmost respect, please, GET OFF YOUR MONOLINGUISTIC HIGH HORSE and go FUCK yourself!

Last, know that when you try to sing Despacito, or order ""una cerveza, señor, por favor"" while vacationing in Punta Cana, your hammered ass sounds much dumber than when I present a worthy topic, in English, for two hours, in front of two hundred people. (As was the case before the pandemic.)

P.S.:

(1) To those that are going to tell me “Hey! Do not worry, we all have an accent"" (e.g. English, Australian, Midwestern American) ... If you spoke a second language, you would know you are missing the point. Thank you in advance for the empathy but when it comes to most social interactions, having a Southern accent or a Boston accent is NOT the same as having an ESL accent. Period.

(2) Where I come from, every time a native English speaker visits, there comes a time when they will open their mouth to shower us with their best try at our language. Of course, they will make use of their robust vocabulary comprised of a dozen words regurgitated at three-toed sloth speeds. We, the hosts, would then patiently LISTEN to their incoherent rumble like little kids eagerly cheering their lesser athletic peer on the playground.

Why is this, you may ask. Well, because we SEE you; we celebrate you and understand your effort. We are (for the most part) honoured by your presence and even take your efforts as a compliment to our roots and culture.

Yet, you seem so very impatient with those of us that have made the arduous journey to speak (and read, and write, and master!) your language.

I hope that one day you will SEE me, celebrate me, and understand my efforts.

You need to know that learning how to order some 'пржено месо' at a restaurant does not make you bilingual nor does it bring you even close to understanding my daily struggle. And for the love of God, do not rush to update your LinkedIn profile to reflect and highlight your ""multilingual abilities"" just because you held baby level conversations with the locals after volunteering for four weeks in Guatemala, or wherever it is that your unilingual self has travelled to gain ""international experience"".

Okay, that is a bit of gatekeeping, to be honest. My sincere apologies.

To the patient readers: if you are passionate about learning a second language, reach out to native speakers in your area. I sure hope you will find a supportive group of people. And please, always remember what it feels like to be holding the short end of the stick. Pay their kindness forward by being patient with ESL speakers.

Aaaand, please don't be like the person who disrespected me.

Elon better get to work on a universal instantaneous translation device. Then I will not have to deal with this hurtful non-sense.

End of rant.

===

All lured to have made this post! I haven’t a baldy notion, but I sense that the only true companion to ESL accents is that of the Irish folk. True, no one understands you! J/k. Let's all partake of the craic!

I will go now and read a novel. In a different language. That I actually can read and understand. Good day.

Love to all. Except for the person that inspired this post. I am not there yet."

Its the way you feel comfortable to come to me with anything. You show me you cuts and buries and that breaks my heart. I want to you when my dad was in the hospital chitsmas night. You texted me that he will be okay. I want to tell you this bit im to scared to. Every time I paste this on to the chat is delete it. Everyone tells me that your not good for me. I dont care about what they say. All I do is talk about you to my friends about you. After the day is over I sit in my bed and stare at my cyliening and thank about you. But I want us to be more the firends but you dont. Most of the time I read your texts threw a foggy mist of tears

The victim died of suffocation. The nerd was obese weighing like three hundred fucking pounds.

I (14 M) is a freshman in high school and like any other kid is going to have a crush on other people that they think suit them. I am not the smartest or the most athletic and I just do what I need to do to pass. Im just a normal high school freshman. 

Now I have a crush that’s in my Spanish (p.4) and English (p.1). She I GORGEOUS to me and whenever I’m in class she is all I can think about. She has nice long dark hair, nice bright brown eyes, and had a beautiful soft voice. 

I kinda expected this because of how damn beautiful she was but she has a boyfriend. Her boyfriend is also in Spanish class with me and my crush. Though they don’t sit next to each other they always text each other in class. And I can tell because I am the lucky one who got to sit next to her. 

And I’m not going to go out on her express how I feel and then go slander her boyfriend saying “THAT SHOULD BE ME IM WAY BETTER THAN HIM” because he’s really cool. He’s on the football team he’s funny and smart. 

I should probably state that I have extreme social anxiety and is a huge introvert so I don’t even talk to my crush at all. The most I’ve ever talked to her was when the class was glueing in notes in our notebook and I forgot my glue at home and asked her if I can borrow hers. 

The main problem that I am having is I can’t seem to get rid of my feelings that I have for her. I constantly beat myself up for it thinking “You need to stop liking her she has a boyfriend stop it.” Another thing is is that I also get a lustful feeling when I’m around her sometimes and I FUCKING HATE IT. I feel like I’m being such an ass whenever that happens. 

But that’s all I really have to say. It’s nothing special I just wanted to really type down what I’m feeling."

i had a normal, happy upbringing. i dont have anger issues. i dont have empathy problems as far as im aware, i once killed a baby bird on purpose and felt bad about it afterwards even though the feeling faded and left me wanting more. i dont hurt people. i feel bad when i even mildly offend someone. but for some reason, when i can find videos of those specific animals in pain, it just makes me so damn happy and i dont know why.

the only exception is some babies. i once saw a shock video of a woman throwing babies on the floor and hitting them, and it was oddly satisfying. i also like seeing videos of babies when they get hurt, especially when it's small children beating them up because they don't know any better.

it's not emotional issues, it's not trauma, it's not even some sick fetish. i get nothing out of it except a feeling of calmness and bliss. maybe it's like that song ""rich girl""? im a very privileged person so maybe i have it so good it makes me feel entitled to seeing others suffer?? i genuinely dont know.

i thought going vegan would help, and for a period of time it did, but after a while i decided ""fuck the animals"" and went full carnist again. and even when i was vegan, after about a month in i started wanting to hurt animals again. my logic was, if i can find empathy for the animals i used to eat, i can find empathy for all animals. did not work out. i just cannot sustain empathy for animals except for a select few.

every few months it gets worse and the more power i get in my surroundings, the more ways i think of to hurt animals. i swear to god it's only a matter of time before i actually go out and do something. it would be a dream but i know i could get caught if it's a cat (which is my latest obsession) and i'd absolutely hate for that to happen."

So, I'm someone who you can probably say is not very emotional, I don't get attached easily and I very rarely open up to someone about my feelings (mainly because I don't ""feel"" much). I've been single my whole life and honestly I've never had a problem with that, I've always been fine on my own and the only time I got romantically involved with a person it was too much too fast for me and concluded that I didn't really want it. 
In the past few months, tho, I think something is starting to change in me because sometimes I find myself wishing I had someone to love. It is so weird for me to admit it, and even tho I know there's absolutely nothing wrong with that I can't help but feel slightly ashamed of it, as I'm not used to being like this. I can't bring myself to confess this to my friends either, that's why I'm here lol .
Sometimes when I go to bed I just wish I had someone lying on my chest as I stroke their hair and comfort them, maybe shower them in compliments if they had a bad day and needed a cuddle. I hardly ever fantasize about being held, I usually just want to hold someone who needs and loves me. 
However, I'm 100% sure that while I like the idea of this, if it happened in real life I'd probably feel very uncomfortable.

So I just found out tonight that my favorite college professors who I have had the pleasure of learning from in two separate courses unexpectedly died over Christmas. 

While I did not really know this man on a personal level, in fact I doubt he would've even known my name if I saw him on the street, he made a long and lasting impression on me. He had a towering intellect and a dry sense of humor which always resonated with me. I would say he was the first professor I had that actually inspired me to really want to work hard as school has generally come pretty easy to me. 

I had always intended to shoot him an email and let him know that he was an inspiration to me and that I learned a great deal of lessons from his classes. Unfortunately, I kept putting it off and never went through with it. I learned of his passing on Facebook when I just searched up his name on a whim and it honestly broke my heart. I wish I had reached out to him and let him know the lasting impression he left on me, but sadly I'll never get the chance. 

It feels strange for me to feel like this, because as I said, I really did not have a personal relationship with this man at all and I suppose it wouldn't make sense for me to feel as bad as I do. That said, I have never really processed death well, especially when it came to those close to me, but this one does hit home. I feel as if someone close to me has passed even though I never knew this professor beyond a classroom environment. 

But, this got me thinking about one of my best friend's suicide from a few years ago and how hard it was to deal with. Truth be told, I wasn't sure I was going to make it through that, and I still haven't completely moved on. I don't know. 

Anyway, I'm rambling at this point and I have been drinking so I'm probably not making a ton of sense. All I ask is that everyone hug their loved ones a little tighter the next time you see them. I know I will."

I’ve tried my hardest to call her mine and I gave in my all. But that call, that phrase, “I just don’t like you enough” really fudging hurts.

She's in her early 50s, energetic and all, perhaps a little too energetic. I love her but she's really been driving me crazy. I find myself getting out of the house every night because I really cannot stand being in the same place as her a second longer. 

Just imagine, you're minding your own business and she comes over every now and then telling you ""something funny"" you literally can't find a fuck to give about. She talks on the phone loudly, watches TV in the background loudly, even when I'm obviously on a zoom call. She screams at my sister and I get second-hand annoyance too because it's all so audible. Sometimes she comes over to vacuum around my seat. JUST MY SEAT. Because she saw it's dirty and she can't wait till I'm off work to do it. 

And omg the moment I take a break, she comes and comment ""wah don't need work already is it? is this how young people work nowadays? you call this working yada yada"" OMG I CANNOT DEAL. 

Ok for a bit of context, we're Asian and we don't move out until we get married because it doesn't make financial sense and it upsets my parents.

In my 20 years of life, I've only been in one relationship, and it turned out horrible. I've talked to a few girls after, but I've had the worst luck with them. Either they have someone they already have on their mind, they don't return my energy, or they simply put play me.

To add salt onto my wounds, COVID stole nearly two years of my college experience, and deteriorated my once renowned and amazing social skills and confidence. That's two years worth of people I could have met and gotten to know down the drain.

Since I'll be graduating Winter 2022, I feel like if I don't find someone in the next two semesters, then I'll be stuck waiting for someone who doesn't exist to walk into my life. Not to mention, trying to date after college with a break as big as mine sounds like a recipe for disaster.

Online dating doesn't work for me. I've tried multiple apps, and the results are the same. Either they don't know how to hold a conversation, they aren't my type, or they don't text back. I don't have any female friends who I could imagine being with, so looking into my own circle isn't an option either.

The only viable option I have is to find someone on campus. That itself poses a lot of issues. I don't know how to make a move on someone who is a complete stranger, someone who I may not even have class with. An additional issue is that they may already have a boyfriend, or they might be in a group setting which would make it really awkward for me if not for the both of us.

I'm have a full beard that I keep light and groomed, I have wavy black hair, I have a 140lbs skinny-athletic physique, and my only physical short coming would be that I'm 5'8 which I hear may matter by some. I don't think there is anything wrong with me physically, it's just I can't find the right one.

I'm basically looking for both support and advice out here. What should I do? What can I do?"

Our friendship was super on and off since he was struggling really bad mentally and I was wary of him (+ all strangers, severe unmanaged social anxiety and whatnot). We'd only started regularly talking around July-ish, when I'd made it clear that I was lesbian. He respected it, but then when I was having a mental health crisis on the day I was flying back to Illinois from California, he admitted he *liked* me. I tried to play it off with the classic ""I get that all the time, don't worry,""  but I was really uncomfortable. He then said he loved me, and I again tried to play it off. Didn't really work.

Fast forward 5 days and he asks me out when I was having urges to hurt myself. He *knew* I was in a bad place mentally and emotionally, he *knew* my judgement was worse that day. And he left me without any other option. Two months later I find out he would've offed himself if I said no, and the fact I found it *endearing* at the time makes me sick. He was also telling me *I* was the reason he was sober from drugs/alcohol, that *I* was the reason he was still alive. A lot of pressure to put on a 17 year old but whatever. I was more often his therapist than I was his partner.

Then it started going downhill. When I came out as trans (FtM at the time), my first concern was him leaving me, while *his* concern was what his parents would think. He started ignoring my relapses and attempts in the winter months because his family life got worse or some other bullshit. He only went to me when he had struggles (which was often) and also downplayed my own. There was one night where I tried to OD and I didn't get reassurance from him because he relapsed minorly. It took me from May to August to recognize all the red flags with the help of some friends, and I wanted to leave.

Then he proposed.
Over text.
We hadn't met in person yet.

And the honeymoon phase came crashing back and wrasses any doubts I had because he ""loved"" me again. Of course it didn't last because I realized I didn't like men at all again (I never did, really. The basis of our relationship was me having pity on him). Then he triggered me severely by showing art he made without warning me first and almost made me relapse after being 3 months clean. Eventually I brought up the problems I had and took a long time to write the message (5+ paragraphs).

He took 10 minutes to read it and tried to play victim.

""I promised I'd look after you and I didn't.""
""I'm sorry, if you want to vent now I promise I'll listen.""
""We're not together anymore, are we?""

He tried to invade my friend group and got mad at one of my friends because she didn't know him very well and was rightfully wary. I got mad at him and was planning on breaking up with him the following day. Then the next day *he* broke up with me and manipulated me into believing he was *actually* going to off himself. He didn't. Then he sent me a long ass message 3 days later about about how he appreciated me and shit.

He's been trying to get back into my life again after me making it clear I want to move on. I can't do it anymore. But, a part of me misses him. I don't know why. The relationship wasn't healthy so why do I still feel like this? It's been 4 months since we broke up and I want to move on. I'm fucking tired."

A little over seven years ago I cheated on my ex-husband. He's a very good man. One of the most honest and loyal people to exist. I (bleep) everything up and what's worse, I hurt the people I love. I broke up a family. I destroyed a happy home.

Since then my life has been nothing but hell. I'm not stable.  I can't hold down a job. I most definitely can't hold down a relationship. I've lost the stamina to do the things that I like to do. I rented a room and had no place to call my own. I struggled to make ends meet and lived paycheck to paycheck. To this day I ask myself wtf was I thinking? How beyond stupid was and/or am I? Why did I go and mess everything up? Wtf is wrong with me? 

Fast-forward to now, I married my boyfriend of three years. He's a good person and does so much for others. I see how hard he works for us and I appreciate that he's intelligent and has great plans for when we retire. I don't know that I'm very happy with him. He's a bully. He has a temper like you wouldn't believe. When he gets mad he can be very insulting. He makes racists comments and he doesn't make me feel like I'm his wife. Don't get me wrong. I'm not considering cheating on him nor am I thinking of leaving him. One, I'm not looking to make that mistake again. And two, well... I just don't want to (beep) up again and go back to where I've been for he past seven years. Renting a room. Bouncing from one job to another. Living paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet, etc. I oftentimes wonder if I will be this unhappy for the rest of my life. Is this my punishment? 

I love my husband. Really. I do. However I oftentimes find myself wishing for the life I had before I went and (beep) it up. I even find myself thinking about my ex-husband. Man! I had it all. My own home. My own space. A good man who loved me and went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy and okay. And that I always had what I needed. I don't know where I'm going with all this and I'm certainly not looking for someone to tell me that everything will be ok.  You will probably judge me. And if you do, I won't blame you.

Yes it is perfectly reasonable to be upset that you aren't pulling your weight in housework and things like that. I've been doing a really good job controlling my emotions and really evaluating situations and in this entire year I have only have one unreasonable outburst and it wasn't even that big, we just had an argument over the phone. There was no name calling, throwing of things, or anything like that, I wasn't even yelling. I had an attitude for sure but it wasn't super big but ever since then every time I feel a negative emotions I always get the question ""have you taken your meds today"" and it's really starting to hurt my feelings because I do consistently take my meds.

She had pictures of him and her as her lock screen, wallpaper and profile pictures on social media, she would write him long texts about how much he meant to her and she randomly drove 2 1/2 hours to his college and made him a gift basket with a hoodie and candy just to surprise visit him. 
It was really annoying to me bc I was his girlfriend at the time and he repeatedly told her he didn’t like her that way (he would have cut her off completely but their families were extremely close and it would have been drama city lol). 
Once my ex and I hit our one year anniversary, she decided I was the obstacle in the way of her one true love, and turned all her attention on being hateful and cruel to me. She would bodyshame me, repeatedly say how she didn’t understand why my ex would date me because he was so perfect and I had all these flaws (which she would list to me in great detail) etc.
She then started lying and claiming I was harassing and bullying HER. She edited YouTube videos as her job (which is actually pretty cool lol) and she also knew how to photoshop screenshots really well. She would make up these fake conversations between herself and me, on both Instagram and iMessage where I was apparently bullying her and telling her to back off and saying all sorts of horrible things.
My ex always claimed he never believed them but regardless I hated the lengths she would go to try and tear me down.

Then she got more aggressive. 

My ex‘s father tragically passed away and since he lived hours away from the school and covid made travel difficult, my ex wouldn’t be able to come to his own fathers funeral. The whole situation was terrible.
This girl bought my ex a round trip plane ticket back home so he could attend the funeral and mourn his father. As much as I didn’t like her, I genuinely appreciated this gesture because I wanted what was best for him. I sent her a message telling her I really appreciated and respected her for doing that, and that she had a really kind heart. 
She responded telling me to consider k*lling myself.
Not even kidding.
She said i was worthless and I was making him depressed and ruining his life. And if I actually cared about him at all, I would have bought him a plane ticket myself. (Keep in mind she was an only child of two 6 figure parents while I was a broke college student living off ramen) Clearly she cared more about my ex and I was just an evil monster who didn’t deserve to be anywhere near him.

Then his fathers funeral happened. She texted him repeatedly asking if she could come to the funeral, to be emotional support. He wouldn’t let her, but later he went out to a bar with some family members to drink and mourn his dad.
She showed up at the bar “by coincidence” and some interaction happened where he was extremely drunk and she tried to either kiss him or get him to confess his love to her or something. He has a foggy memory of the incident and she was a compulsive liar so we will never know for sure what happened.
The gist is that he rejected her advances and she became extremely upset and texted me about a million times saying I should k*ll myself, I should break up with him and never speak to him again, claiming that my ex drunkenly admitted he had feelings for her, saying the two of them made out and she was comforting him after his loss, while I was sitting on my ass back at school and ignoring him when he needed me most.
Since, as I mentioned before, he was extremely inebriated, he wasn’t on his phone so that whole night I was getting messages from her but he wouldn’t answer me and it was really stressful wondering what was happening.
That night was the final straw and once my ex was sober and saw what she had said he blocked her on everything and completely cut her off despite her family and some of his relatives giving him hate for it.

He and I ultimately broke up and have gone our separate ways, but recently I found out the girl committed suicide. 

One part of me feels awful. Clearly her behavior was unacceptable but it was almost certainly coming from a place of hurt and she had many of her own issues to work through. Maybe instead of disliking and judging her so much I should have been more compassionate. Also she was SO obsessed with telling me to kill myself when she hated me, that looking back I should have seen the hyper fixation on suicide as a warning sign. I almost feel responsible for her death.
Another, horrible part of me, is kind of happy about it. It feels so evil and wrong to type and I don’t know how to not feel this way."

My family already spends enough time thinking about this, and I don't have friends. I am an unemployed, agoraphobic shut-in.

&#x200B;

I guess I just want to rant about my father's medical trajectory over the past year. He's 68. Always been an active dude. Musician. Fronted a cover band in bars and diners until the pandemic, which also involuntarily retired (read: fired) him from his day job. Played guitar for his church as long as he could.  

&#x200B;

Sometime around the start of the year, he developed a cough that wouldn't go away. Given the times we're living in, I was pretty worried he might have covid. He was tested and came up negative. That was a relief.

&#x200B;

But more time passed and the cough wouldn't go away, so I was pretty worried. He went to the doctor and had some chest x-rays done. They found no anomalies. Everything looked fine, and he was given an inhaler. That was a relief.

&#x200B;

About a month or two later (maybe 3, it's kinda hazy), after it kept getting worse, he had another x-ray done and was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. It had also spread to other places. Out of the fucking blue. Visit 1, ""we don't see anything wrong""; visit 2, ""you have very advanced cancer"". It's bullshit. But hey, okay, what needs to be done? Well, first, he married his girlfriend. Which is romantic. I like that. Then chemo. Everything caught up so quickly after he told us in July. I don't think it was more than a month or two before he could barely walk, barely talk, and barely breathe. I don't live with him, and have trouble leaving myself, so my brother taking me to his place on Saturdays was when I saw him. Every week it was like part of him was chipped away. Then, one day, he had to be rushed to the hospital with fluid filled lungs. He was not expected to leave, but - long(er) story short(er) - his wife... I guess my stepmom, was able to get the absurdly expensive medication he needed (none of us have much money) for free, and he was able to go home soon. That was a relief.

&#x200B;

More time passed. He had good days and bad days, but overall, he seemed to be getting better. Three weeks ago, he told us that he had gotten some tests back. The cancer stopped. He was in remission. That was the biggest relief I could ask for.

&#x200B;

On Christmas Eve, my brother was going to take me to my my Dad's in about an hour, but he had to be rushed to the hospital with fluid filled lungs. Again. Only this time, when we called him the next day, they said the fluid was a more viscous gel that couldn't be drained the way it was before. They said that a larger, more invasive tube would need to be used the next day. They said they didn't know if it would work, and if it didn't, surgery would be the absolute only option. Lung surgery. On the lung cancer patient. They said that surgery would very possibly kill him due to the issue of having to operate around a tumor. Merry fucking Christmas. I should also mention that the renewed covid stuff means we can't go there and can't be with him. He had given a testimonial at his church the week prior and it was sent to us to watch. It made me fucking livid. It was him recounting much of what I already outlined; the diagnosis, the free drugs, and the borderline miraculous recovery, ending with thunderous applause from the church. It was so fucking hopeful, and it was \_one fucking week\_ ago. But anyway, the next day, we found out that the tube worked and was draining, which was - say it with me now - a relief.

&#x200B;

The next day (two days ago), they told us that, although the fluid was draining, it was also rapidly refilling and they can't figure out why. The only thing that can be done is to fit him with a catheter to continually drain it, and put him on oxygen for the rest of his life. He was active as fuck 8 months ago and enjoying his retirement, and now now he'll have to carry around a bag a tank and a mask for however long he has and not be able to sing anymore. But hey, he'll be alive for a little while probably, maybe giving me a little time to do something - \_anything\_ - worthwhile so he won't die with a \_complete\_ failure of a son, so in a way, it's kind of a relief. I like making music, so maybe I have some time to buckle down and make something he'll like or can be proud of.

&#x200B;

And I came here to write this after talking to him today (still in the hospital). For whatever goddamn reason (he said his oncologist was ""flabbergasted""), cancer's rebounded. Chemo tomorrow. It's a fucking joke at this point.

&#x200B;

I'm also so, unimaginably ashamed because the Saturday before Christmas, I didn't go with my brother to hang out with him. I should have, but I didn't. Yes, as stated before, my mental health issues can make simple things like that hard, and yes, my family knows that. But that doesn't change the fact that, because I couldn't drag my ass out of bed, it's very likely that I missed the very last chance I had to physically be near my Dad and give him a hug. I don't know how to deal with that.

I don’t even know why at this point. Everything’s just been so shitty, and it’s the middle of winter, so the lack of sun (which I already don’t get enough of) is worse than usual. 

I don’t really leave the house anymore unless if it’s to go to work, where I usually try to keep to myself because I’m too anxious to try to talk to my coworkers, since I feel like I’m just really annoying. And I feel inferior to everyone because I’m a lot younger (18, everyone else is 20-30 something, and some of the people I grew up around forced me into this mindset). Plus I’m generally really insecure about myself, since I feel like I get in the way of everything, my voice is the auditory equivalent of mustard gas, and I look like a gloopy puddle with hair that’s the colour of sea slime. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore, since I want to get out of the house and do something, but since college started I’ve become pretty isolated. My GPA got knocked from 4.0 down to a 3.7 because I missed literally half of my classes after getting sick back to back 3 or 4 times, so I have no hope of getting into med school. 

I feel like I’m going nowhere in life, since I don’t have hobbies anymore, am barely scraping by in school, and I’ve become a workaholic to cope with everything because I don’t want to go back to chugging vodka when things go wrong, because I feel like I’m at least being productive and not just a useless waste of genetic material. 

I just don’t have the motivation to do anything more than the bare minimum, and it makes me feel like a narcissistic black hole that consumes resources that could be going to people who actually need it. 

Also, people keep telling me it’ll get better, and I hate hearing that because no, it fucking doesn’t. 

**TL;DR I fucking loathe my existence and I don’t have the motivation to do anything, so I feel like I’m just wasting my life and it’d be better if I stopped existing so whatever resources are being wasted on me could go to someone who needs them."

I'm sorry if the details are messy, I'm still reeling over everything.

**TL;DR:** *My uncle's girlfriend found him post-suicide attempt. She shrugged it off and brought him down for regular Christmas shenanigans.  She was also covid positive, and now several of us have been exposed.*

On Christmas, my spouse and I decided to visit my grandma (masked + fully vaccinated) to give her her gift and get some Christmas food. In the middle of everything, my grandma got a phone call from my uncle's number. It was his girlfriend. In the most bored, disinterested, and deadpan way possible, she told my grandma that her son was passed out in the shower and that he had taken several pills with the intention of killing himself.  We only heard this because my grandma is quite hard of hearing and tends to put the phone on speakerphone. The hospital or ambulance hadn't been called: she instead took the time to complain to my 80+ year old grandmother who had already lost her husband and several of her kids. My grandma did not take it well at all.

In the end, she brought my uncle to the town to see my grandma. My uncle was clearly unwell, and just giving him a hug and telling him that we loved him brought him to quiet tears. He did not seem entirely over his overdose. Meanwhile, his gf was handing Christmas socks to my grandma and talking about the weather. My spouse and I privately told my uncle that seeing a doctor/therapist, and we would be willing to take him and help him.

A lot of things happened in between, but eventually we left for home, and within a day or so I began to feel a sick. We found out today that my uncle's girlfriend had been in close contact with someone who was covid-positive just before she saw my grandma.

I don't know if my anger is misplaced, but it drives me insane to think that my uncle's SO found him passed out and treated it as though it was just a nuisance to gossip about (and lacked the tact to give the news to my grandma gently). It also is infuriating to know that my grandma has now had exposure to someone with covid.  I can take some peace in knowing that she's fully vaccinated with boosters, and when I spoke with her on the phone today, she seemed to be doing well (and much more concerned about me).  I'm sick and have spent most of the last few days sleeping and drinking clear liquids, and my spouse and I have a test scheduled soon.

I'd also really appreciate any advice as to how to help my uncle. Over the years, I've come to slowly understand that several of my relatives have suicidal ideation and severe depression, but because no one really knows what those are or believes in mental health, the response is to kind of shame the person (or ignore them).

I'm sorry if I'm being a jerk.

The argument started because my younger brother announced I was sick. I had been announcing for weeks, my body has felt off, and I was worried about gallbladder attacks or appendicitis. I was denied being taken to a doctor for anything else besides if I had felt that I had covid. My mother lashed out years worth of horrible remarks and statements. She told me I ruined everything and I retaliated by outing her on Facebook. She involved my father and he lashed out worse than she did. He basically told me I was not allowed home, I was threatened for 3 hours straight until I had my boyfriend pick me up and take me to stay with him until I can get back onto my feet. they have threatened me for years and have often physically lashed out on me. I am 20 years old, I understand that I am living under their roof, and must abide by their rules, but they treat me like absolute shit. I was not allowed to wash clothes, or do small tasks without supervision or permission. My phone was constantly checked and they would check my phone bill to be nosy and invade my privacy. I often didn't tell them details about my life while away in college because they often threatened to make me stay home, or have me kicked out of school. The abuse has been going on for years and part of me is terrified and relieved to finally be away from them. I have so many screenshots of my father threatening me but since I have them saved on Twitter and my boyfriends phone I am unable to upload them at the current moment. Basically my father said very degrading things and how hates me. This could've all been avoided if somebody listened when I said felt sick and didn't drag me onto a trip for a scapegoat. Every family trip I have went on was horrible. I was degraded, humiliated and lashed out on. I have no other family members to contact, my only option was my boyfriend and his family since my lovely, parents manages to make everyone believe I am the problem. They never fail, they're just narcissistic. I felt as though I would never win for years, finally being kicked out has opened my eyes and made me realize so many negative behaviors and patterns. They tried to gaslight me into staying and apologizing for being sick. Which is something beyond my control, I don't understand why I have to apologize for a human function. My allergies have been at an all time high, and they refused to get my allergy medicines refilled or picked up from the pharmacy, my health always came last to them. Not to mention my mother was pretending to have breast cancer for sympathy and attention. Turns out she didn't/doesn't have it, she just was manipulating me into feeling bad for as she always does. I hate to say that I hate someone, but I truly hate both of my parents for all of the years of emotional, verbal, and physical abuse they have put me through. I just feel like I am at an all time low and wont ever recover from this until I'm fully away from them. I'm just filled with so much anger and rage currently but the matured side of me wants to let them find out when they come home from their family trip that I am gone. They have threatened to press charges on me, because they kicked me out then said if I were to leave they'll have the police come get me. Which is fucking stupid and pointless, they don't want me to stay but threaten to have me brought back. It's very controlling and manipulative to say that to their child. Legally, all they could do is a missing person report which would be utterly useless if I am in a safe and stable environment."

After this whole debacle I posted in TrueOffMyChest (before I learned about this subreddit): 

*“So this past Christmas literally all I wanted was a bigger aquarium for my pleco, a compass that can measure strike and dip (geology student here), and a lens filter kit for my telescope. The total price amount for these three items, the ONLY things I wanted or needed (my pleco needs a new and bigger tank because his is too small and the seams are starting to go. Also a lot that fits it like the lights and the filter are going so I felt it’s better to upgrade), comes to less than $300. Literally that’s all I wanted for Christmas that was considered expensive. The few things that I asked for that were cheaper was a new kickstand for my bike (ie. a wider one that won’t sink into mud easily), an iTunes card ($25-$50), and a few other items I can’t recall off the top of my head.*

*Now, please keep in mind that my mother has told me not to spend too much on myself, and save my money for tuition. Fair. I kept a budget of less than $250 for all the gifts I bought, and bought a lot of stuff on sale. She told me that she’d get me a lot of what I wanted. I also gave her my list in late August/early September.* 

*Come Christmas, the only thing on my list that I got was a $15 iTunes card. Instead I got a bunch of stuff I didn’t need. Eight pairs of socks (to go with the several I *already bought myself months earlier*), three sweaters (to go with the five perfectly fine ones I already have), a FitBit (I don’t need at ALL, and I’m not overweight!), a LEGO Aquarium (ugh!!) and several gift cards to stores I don’t even go to. I had to fake a smile even though inside I was crushed. I got nothing that I wanted.*

*And my sister? Oh my God, I know who’s the favourite now. She got the Apple AirPods Max, a new PC desktop computer (she didn’t need one, she had a perfectly working one! I was actually offered the old one so I took it because I actually did need to use a PC), a gaming chair, and a $200 ITunes card!*

*My brother, who doesn’t even *live* with us, got a $400 gift card to go towards a new phone, a gift card to his favourite sports store, and a new iPad.*

*I feel so broken from this. My sister and brother got all that expensive stuff they wanted… and I got nothing.*

*So, when my family went out today (they made reservations at a fancy restaurant and didn’t *tell me*. I only found out when I saw it on my sister’s social media feed), I went into my parents’ and sister’s desks and rooms, as well as my brother’s suitcase, and found all the receipts to the gifts they got me. I then spent the day either returning what I could and taking the cash, coming to the stores and managing to get cash from the gift cards (either through buying items and then returning them, or just getting the cash back), or just selling the gift cards to whoever wanted one because the stores wouldn’t let me get the cash from them. I managed to get about $400.00 from everything, the only things I did not return being two of the sweaters (they were cheap ones and my Mom would notice), the iTunes card, and the LEGO aquarium (because that would also be noticed). But my parents spent over $3000.00 on my sister (on items that they would’ve made me buy), and over $1000.00 on my brother.*

*I now have the money for the real aquarium, the compass, and a few other items. Most of which I’ve now ordered. I even bought myself some takeout for dinner since they’re still eating out at a fancy place.* 

*I don’t care about the money or the prices. Just that they didn’t buy what I asked for and what they *said they’d buy*, but instead for the same amount  it would’ve costed bought a ton of stuff I didn’t even need.*”

Something missing from above is that my gifts from my siblings were useless or painful joke gifts at my expense, while I gave them heartfelt gifts. I’m the middle sibling here, my brother not even living with us and just visiting. 

So, after getting all the money I needed and buying the gifts, then after posting, I ate my take out dinner and threw away the trash into the outside garbage so that they wouldn’t see it. 

It was painful, going to bed and laying there last night, listening as they came up to the door laughing and talking about what a great time they had. Shushing themselves so that they wouldn’t wake me…

This morning, when I got up after crying myself to sleep, I was the last up at 10am. 

I got downstairs and then slipped back upstairs when I saw that Mom made pancakes… but there were none left for me. No one even tried to wake me. They acted as though I didn’t even live there… 

When I did come down closer to 11am, they acted as though pancakes hadn’t been made at all. So I just had cold cereal. 

Then, my brother and sister suddenly went out, without asking if I wanted to come. I then got dragged out to help my Mom grocery shop. When we came back, I saw my brother and sister going over their shopping spree items… and I couldn’t take it and ran upstairs. I ended up skipping dinner today because I just couldn’t eat… and watched as my family didn’t even bother to check on me, instead going out again for hours. I still haven’t eaten. 

I had been scrolling through my sister’s posts on social media, wondering where they were going without me now… when I saw a post saying “Glad my sister didn’t come. She’s such a drag”

That stung. Badly… and it felt like I got stabbed when I saw that they went down to another city to look at the light displays that the city had set up. They didn’t even ask if I wanted to go. KNOWING how much I had wanted to go… 

I pretended to be asleep when they got  back, and overheard my parents talking quietly in the hallway. About how they wondered how much longer I would stay in university given my Autism. How they hoped that not giving me the gifts I wanted would teach me that my Autism wouldn’t hand me life on a silver platter. To expect disappointment. 

It stung. I’ve never been selfish like that. I’ve worked my butt off to pay and get good grades in university. My damn mother had always taught me that stuff!! 

I can’t understand it! I know better than to expect everything from life. I know I have to work hard! But I’ve never seen this side of my parents. I thought they loved me!! Understood me for me!! I don’t know what to do now!! And if it wasn’t for housing prices being so high I’d move out in a snap! 

I wish I could understand what made them think that giving me the worst Christmas ever while spoiling and giving my siblings the best would teach me. Because it’s taught me that being autistic either gets you coddled, treated like garbage, or treated like you need to fight harder for things. I haven’t tried to be a bad kid! I’ve saved up all my money for tuition! I didn’t buy anything I wanted because my mother, an accountant, told me not to. That she would handle it and that she’d get it for me for Christmas. 

She lied. My mother was the one person I trusted the most and she LIED. I’m crying now I don’t know what to do. I’m not as loved because of my stupid autism!!

Edit: I’m going to sleep now to try and rest. I’m going to confront my parents tomorrow about this. I know I haven’t gotten any comments. I get it. It’s a selfish thing to get rid of most of my presents for cash. That I should be thankful. Well, I’ve been that way my whole life and it’s now become clear how favorited my siblings are. It’s not right and I’m going to need the rest before I confront my parents. They’ve never acted like this before to my knowledge and I need to learn why."

I don't care about him but I feel like he thinks he's fooling me or something and for some reason I do care about that. 

Maybe this makes me crazier than him hahaha what am I doing here... 🤦‍♀️

I usually do a total of 10-12 hrs on the weekends but I’ve recently been putting in 4-5 hrs on random days during the week because my college is on Christmas break right now. 

Today, I accepted a delivery for a restaurant in a part of my city that is a little sketchy but I am very familiar with since my mom lives less than 10 min away. This happened in the early evening, so I could still see pretty well outside. My sister (17) was also with me.

I pulled into the restaurant’s parking lot and found a spot toward the back of the parking lot. This parking lot isn’t very big, maybe 4 rows. As I’m pulling in, I notice a car pulling in behind me. No big deal. The car parks right beside mine. Still no big deal. I try to look inside the car, but the windows are tinted and I can’t really see anything inside. I usually play games on my phone for a few minutes when I arrive at restaurants so that I’m not awkwardly standing inside while the food is still being cooked. Today was no different. I killed maybe 5 min just playing games on my phone but made sure to be cognizant of the car previously mentioned. I expected someone to get out during the time I was on my phone but nobody did.

I stopped playing the game on my phone and got out. I asked my sister if she wanted to go inside with me because I was getting an uneasy feeling about the car parked beside us and didn’t want her to be in the car alone. She said that she’d be fine in the car and that I was probably overreacting, so I told her to make sure all of the doors remained locked at the least. I shut the door and got a good look at the car parked beside me. I tried to make a mental note of the make and model and heard it rattling pretty hard. Before I walked away from my car, I tested my driver side door handle to make sure my door was locked. As I started walking toward the restaurant, I kept an eye on that car as best as I could.

Next thing I know, they peel out of the parking lot. This was in the span of maybe 5-10 second from me testing my door handle. When they peeled out, I turned around and tried to at least take a mental note of the plate number, but they had to be going at least 40 and jumped on a very busy road.

Is this not super sketchy?"

I just wish I had a couple more hours.

Your breath on the hickeys youd created was healing, though if it were up to me they'd exist indefinitely

And we'd be able to.


50 minutes left

There were these frantic steps. We tried to pack your life into my Dodge caliber faster than time itself in hopes of having 45 minutes left to relax. To breathe. To love and be loved. The necklace you made me burned in a way that I had never felt before. 

I knew soon you'd be states away, I feared you'd forget about the magic that was us being the friends that we were. My insecurities resurfacing as quickly as they dissipated... The first time that we stayed up late

We made forts. We told our stories. Or atleast the chapters that we'd endured enough to exchange

30 minutes left. 

We kissed again. Within these lips was a lifetime of euphoria. shrooms in the woods. ""What's your fetishes?"" Brie cheese and shitty wine. Movies and origami. 

You were better than I was at that, but I'd just make you laugh anyways. We walked to the school dining halls and nothing tastes good enough, but we ate enough to be full, then went to get ramen from the corner store to ease the growels we'd hear as we layed on eachothers laps. I experienced rest for once even in our shortest naps.

15 minutes

Our sighs are long, our shoulders droop, there's no other ways to say this. Our I miss yous began months ago. What I'd give to go back a month and lay explaining ADHD types while you responded bipolar classifications. We'd been so wronged by our parents, to find someone our age that could say ""I wish you'd had more"" felt like Vicks. The acetaminophen you'd take for your restless achy knees and the melatonin for your restless mind. I'd rub your stomach, and hope I could transfer good health to you, you'd pinch my hand and my migraines wouldn't fade, but I could feel you willing they would. 

5 minutes

There's tears.

We had gone a whole semester barely crying. Somehow though, we were a heap on your bed, begging god to give us the time to experience our hellos with the understanding that came with these goodbyes. Lipstick on foreheads, love in our embraces, how could we have been so foolish... To have fallen in Plato's depictions with another fool who lived on the other side of the world. 

You gave me a gift. You placed what you couldn't bring in my room. If I could have a bottle of a hug from you I imagine I'd be unstoppable if I could find 15 minutes in all strife to place myself in your arms. But God would be so cruel that he would place community just outside my fingertips, as he's done every year. 

And then we walked to the car. 

I drove you to the airport.

And you went home."

Hard to be happy sometimes when so many people I care about only exist in my mind and heart right now. If I focus more on the heart part and less on the mind, I'm far more likely to not get upset. Funny how that is.

Only 2 friends could come to my birthday party and over all it was very awkward and they couldn’t stay very long. 

       I do have a boyfriend that I get to hangout with frequently but he makes friends so easily it’s insane. He has so many genuinely good friends too that he can count on. I’m getting to the point where anytime he goes to hangout with friends or mentions them I get so so so jealous though I don’t express it because it would be wrong, I am of course happy for him.

There are two people I talk to. Really abusive upbringing and just a super weird background life story. Anyhow, consider that and remember I’ve been independent since a young young age. 

I often wonder how nice it’d be to have a parent. I’m 25 now. It sounds younger than it feels. For most of my life, I wondered what it’d be like to have parents that are there. What is it like to sit on their couch and talk about your life or career? Would the hugs feel different? Would they really help at times? 

Since I was a pre-teen, I’d read on Yahoo Answers questions soon-to-adopt parents would ask. “What’s it like to adopt a teenager?”

I’d read their responses and pray that if I’m lucky someone will want to take me. I emailed some people saying I had good grades and was a nice kid in a really bad situation at home. One responded. I was 12. I was really trying to think of any way to survive. Nothing came of it. That’s just an anecdote to share how curious and lonely I’ve been throughout the years. 

I survived. Sometimes I entertain that idea of having that. Some people get friends or chosen family to compensate. I read a story about a kid adopted by her best friend’s family. I’m happy for her.

But why not me? Frankly I don’t even know if I want that. How do I even act within that parent-child dynamic? Questions that don’t really need to be answered, I guess. 

I want to get off my chest that I am sad and sometimes I think it would be nice to have a parent or someone of that simulacrum. I don’t think I’m asking for much."

Even if my post is dumb, I thought this was a place you could go to be flawed. To feel and be human and irrational. Can people not just understand that sometimes, we think things that logically don’t make sense, because we feel strongly.

My area is currently enduring a cold snap and I've been working in freezing conditions this week. I enjoy my job and my co-workers are the best. Today though, just felt like we got our asses kicked.  

Me and my two co-workers were at an apartment complex that had all the drainage pipes on the first floor, above the open parkade, freeze. That means nothing is able to go down any of the drains in this particular building in its current state. The whole first floor was a mess because the floors above just kept using their plumbing even though they were asked not to. It basically turned the whole first floor into a septic tank. The people on the first floor apartments can't even stay in their homes now. It felt hopeless trying to fight against the weather to melt all the ice blocking the drains. Just a slow, painfully cold battle to fix the problem. A 10 hour day and we still have more to do there, not to mention the other buildings calling us with similar or worse problems.  

While I was working, I learned this has happened to this building multiple times in the past. The management just hasn't bothered to properly fix the, Electrical, Heating and Insulation problems. So it becomes a ""Plumbing"" problem. It's cheaper to pay a few thousand bucks when everything freezes than it is to just do the right thing and fix the building. So every other year or so, people that live in the lower income rentals on the bottom floor get completely fucked. Then the management restores the bare minimum of what they're legally required to and rent the places out again.  

Also, when I was home on my lunch break, my girlfriend accidentally dropped a jumbo metal water bottle on my phone and broke the screen. Just really unlucky. She felt so bad and kept apologizing and I was really angry too, but I assured her it wasn't her fault and that'll be okay. When I got home after work all she wanted to do was be close to me and apologize more and express how bad she felt about it still. So I continued to reassure her it's fine. It's just a thing, it can be fixed/replaced. It's just took what little I had left in me to not being a negative dick head and properly express myself. I don't want her to feel bad for an accident or because my day was hard. I just wanted to be alone and I really appreciate her understanding that cause it's hard to communicate that without hurting her feelings sometimes.  

Normally I'd vent to my brother who is away on vacation right now. I don't want to ruin his and his wife's last vacation together before they're first baby comes. But all I want to do is talk to him about my shitty day and the new Spider-Man movie... I already miss him being home and he left two days ago. I know once they have the baby, I also can't drop my bad days on him either cause he'll have so much on his plate...  
  
I'm just feeling solemn and angry about the world and how this stupid building is managed. I'm cold, I hate winter, I'm struggling to keep my headspace positive. I just wanted to put all my negative feelings somewhere that won't affect the people in my life. I know lots of people in this subreddit have way more serious things going on. I just truly wanted to get all this off my chest cause I feel like I'm in an emotional spiral and I just appreciate anyone who made it though all my rambling...

I still can't believe I'm already 25. Sure, I'm still young but mentally, I feel about 50. There just doesn't seem to be that much to look forward to anymore and it's been that way since my early 20s. All life is now is just work, play, work. What's next, make a few kids and have a big white house with a white picket fence? I don't think that would make me happy.

The only friend I had just wanted to play video games all day and drive around in his car. He got money from somewhere, so as far as he was concerned, he didn't need to give a shit about time wasting or life like I did, so I had to stop talking to him. Not only that, but everything was about him. I was always the one downloading shit games on my PC just to play games with him, yet, he'd never do me any favours. He asked me to play a game with him a few months ago and I said no because I was tired of it. Me and my family know he's a bit of a loose canon but I just accepted him for who he was. Hell, I'm not perfect either but he's like a Norman Bates without actually committing any crimes. The way he talks to his friends compared to how he talks to his mother is staggering. It's like he's two different people.

I just don't know how other people cope with the bullshit of life. It seems the only time people want to be in my life is because they're batshit insane or they're a single mother who just wants me to be a provider for her kids. I know not all single mothers are the same but the ones that talk to me are just really fucking obvious. I'm not fucking stupid and no, I'm not interesting in raising kids that aren't mine. It's nothing personal, I just don't want that drama in my life, especially since it's drama I didn't create. Is this all there is left, to be a sucker in life? There's only a few more things I actually want to do in my life, make a 3D game engine, visit Japan, etc, after I've done all that, I don't have much reason to be here.

It didn't feel that long ago since I graduated highschool but it's been years. My generation are getting old and it kinda sucks. It's not so much about the aging (I'm fine with that, really), it's the part where you lose your old friends because life finally hits everyone. Honestly, I died when I hit my early 20s.

Makes you realise just how much time is wasted on meaningless bullshit."

My brother has diagnosed schizophrenia and my grandfather did too before he died from alcohol poisoning. Likely, they both had PTSD.

I was the golden child, I carried the weight of hope but also was looked down on by rich relatives. No one believed in me, but I wanted a low key life void of drama. My only downfall was I always wished everyone was happy. 

Now I’m an adult, a professional working my ass off and living far away from my family for above reasons, I’m feeling happy for the first time. I realized recently that my family cannot be happy. So I can’t wait for them to be happy in order to be happy myself. 

My life is really great aside from my family. I chose a boyfriend that hates drugs, is very affectionate when I need him to be, and allows me to be independent so I don’t feel controlled like I was in my family. He is not rich and neither am I, we make enough to pay rent and travel home every few months. Despite all the expectations for me to marry someone who is rich, or for me to work a job that will make me rich, I finally realized none of it mattered. I have a very privileged life where no one can force me to be someone I don’t want to be and I realized I need to cherish that so I can be happy. No one is perfect. 

In this new year, I hope to be happy in ways I haven’t allowed myself to be before. Happy New Year everyone~"

basically the people i confided in kinda blew it off like it wasn't a big deal but the truth is it still really bothers me. it's not enough to take to the police but it's enough to do some emotional damage.

a year ago i got drunk with a co worker i had a fling with.. we already hung out a couples times so i was comfortable with him and could trust him. my mistake in all of this was drinking to the point of blacking out. 

i like to tell the full details of the story as it adds to my confusion even more.. but i ended vomiting and peeing my pants (not my proudest moment) so he took me back to his place to get me cleaned up and to sleep. 

at the time i remember going to his apartment, smoking on the balcony and then laying on the floor falling asleep while his cousin was watching tiktok. my clothes were being washed and he gave me a t shirt and his lavalava to wear (my underwears were also being washed)

i woke up in the middle of the night to him laying down next to me, (as i was scooting over to make room for him) and then i remember falling asleep cuddling.

the next time i remember waking up he was fingering me in my sleep. (mind you i didn't even shower i just changed clothes and cleaned up a bit) i was still in and out of sleep because i was that drunk.. i remember him on top of me trying to get it in, but luckily for me he had whisky d*ck and couldn't. i still remember feeling his half hard junk on me it's nauseating.

i remember telling him to stop and i got up and tried to go pee because i really had to but it wouldn't come out. that was the first sign that i have been messed with (ladies iykyk) 

from what i know he left me alone for the rest of the night and the next morning i had to get up and pretend like nothing happened and eat at his house (his mother wouldn't let me leave until i ate something) and when he walked me to my car i addressed the issue (as we are co workers who work shifts together and have to communicate) 

the next time i saw him at work was terrible. it was on valentine's day and it was busy (i was a bartender he was a cook) i can't even remember that day because my anxiety was that bad. and i had to work with him there was no choice. i told my manager what happened and all she could do was say she was sorry that happened. 

i don't talk about it very much cause in the grand scale of things i wasn't raped. but for someone i had feelings for to completely violate me and ruin my trust like that... it hurts. thanks for letting me vent"

It leads to me mentally exploring a lot of different kinks. I started in fifth grade, continued until now (actively trying to stop). I met my most recent girlfriend about two years ago and we both were eager to explore some stuff. She was incredibly gorgeous, I couldn’t believe my eyes and that she wanted me. Anyway, shamefully, we both participated in significantly sexualizing and objectifying her in many ways. She became my own pornstar if I wanted, anything I’d like. This lead to a lot of insecurity on my part (even though I initiated and usually was the one to suggest doing these kinds of things). We engaged in polyamory early on, causing significant issues. I ended up talking to girls on the side simply for sexting, she found that. Became much colder after, fair enough. Times got tough and we lived together, she wasn’t making any money. We were strained, stressed and undersexed. She started an OF. Pretty low key, but grew more and more, now she’s advertising on her public Instagram profile and whatnot. 
	Pornography has absolutely ruined my sexuality in every way and I transferred that onto her and have ruined her whole sense of self and worth as a woman, specifically regarding sexuality. She has to pay a bit over $13K in taxes because she spoiled me and herself instead of saving for taxes. Anyway, we stopped talking. Yes, it makes me jealous, I’m not bitter with her, though. As per her own words, I destroyed her. That’s the second time I’ve been told that by a long-term lover. I need help, I’m not denying that. I told her early, early into our relationship that I’d make her hate me one day. I wrote down every toxic behavior and red flag. They were all there. She saw them all. She ignored them. She did many awful things, too, but whatever. She can post about that in the ether on her own time. 
	I understand OF can be considered financially liberating and I’m not judging. By her own admission, OF and camming have caused her serious mental health issues and image and self-worth issues. It is destroying her, but she’s trapped until she makes enough money to pay off her taxes. She is of course ultimately accountable for her own actions, but those are my thoughts. Thank you."

this whole year im at rock bottom. no job, no one to interact with at all except for him, a guy twice my age... i watch my lil dream crushed and im at a total loss in life, desperate, on top of all that i lacked real world experiences... then i met him... thought we could be platonic friends despite the age gap... bc he understands me, we have so much in common... turns out he's after me only bc im a woman with vagina. by the time i had involuntary sex with him it was too late, i was frozen, in disbelief, combined with disgust, confusion, disillusion... i deserved it anyways, im worthless, no use to society.. and maybe we dont need to conform to society's norms that are merely constructed by fellow human beings. norms apply to the majority, individually we make desicions based on our own subjective experience according to different circumstances. whats wrong with being with a man of ur father's age? maybe we live in a simulation?

 i kept coming back to him. i came up with mutiple reasons and theories to justify what i was doing... was that ""stockholm syndrome""? or was i thinking too much ive gone mad? 

he often ignores my msgs, hes never emotionally available for me. he treats me like im so disposable.... its very clear hes not interested in my life and he uses me as his toy. but he was the only person who ""understands"" me and interacts with me irl.....

im such a fool lol. why is it that my life's so dramatic? i dont even have audience? whats wrong with me?

i blocked him a week ago... then memories rush in.. we watched tv on his ipad in a restaurant that we frequented.. we talked in some remote coffee shop with few customers... we explored lil villages and ate local pizza.. we had lil moments in the gardens... i can no longer experience these things. i can no longer see him, or text him, or share utube links and books........

rrt0ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rrt0ur/i_dont_like_spaces_designated_for_the_disabled/,"I don't like spaces designated for the disabled: parking spots, theater seats.",0,14,1640840282.0," I tried to post this on unpopular opinion, but the stupid bot thinks it's about obesity.

Handicap-accessible spaces are bullshit.  There are way too many of them, and they are rarely occupied.  Permits for handicap accessible spots are given liberally to people who don’t really need them.  The ADA defines a disability as “an impairment of a major life function.”  The definition is broad, and it grants people handicap-parking permits for petty reasons, including: 

* Bad eyesight
* Bad hearing 
* Skin conditions
* Neurological disorders, E.G., ADHD, Anxiety
* Diabetes
* General loss of mobility because of injury.  E.G., Broken finger
* Speech Impairments

There have been times in my life when I could have qualified for a permit, but I chose not to apply because I am blessed to be able to walk from the end of the parking lot.  I don’t mind walking a little more to make life easier for people who need help. However, It is frustrating to see unoccupied handicap- seats in the movie theater. And it is frustrating to see unoccupied handicap-parking spaces outside a business.  It’s a waste of space and money.   It also hurts small businesses the most. Making the mandated accommodations is expensive, and they are most vulnerable to litigation abuse.  Litigation abuse is common with the ADA.  Small companies get sued for petty reasons such as:  

* A ramp is too steep
* The tables are too high
* Handicap grab bars in the wrong position
* Wrong kind of door handle
* Writing too small

Advocates claim they are protecting the civil rights of disabled Americans, but they rarely help.  They result in vast unintended consequences such as actual discrimination, and the opportunity for abusive lawsuits. The Bus Boycott of 1955 fought racial discrimination against African Americans. Bus companies forced African Americans to relinquish their seat to White Americans and sit at the back of a bus.  When a business doesn’t make accommodations mandated by the ADA,  they aren’t preventing a disabled person from exercising their rights; their disability is. 

These lawsuits don’t benefit anybody, but the lawyers.

The resources are better spent on technology that helps disabled people adapt to their environment, not the other way around."

Stayed there for a few years and oh my God did I try to make friends and integrate with society but failed to do so on so many ends.  Almost every one I met barely knew where Canada was on the map, had no interest in knowing and was super uninterested in learning where I came from or my background.  I tried so hard not to internally criticize anyone (failing at many ends obviously) and to lift all my biases towards people but still, always felt like I was talking to a wall when meeting Americans (even immigrants there).

I just moved to a new country this year not even knowing the language, and knowing 1 friend coming here.  I've made more friends these past few months than all my years in the USA, and most importantly get along with all of them!  And thinking about it now, not ONCE did I get asked where Canada was, or any other country in the world for that matter.  I've gotten used to shutting up about my background because no one cared in the USA but even offering tidbits people here are curious.

The best part of it all is that I just realized while I'm not rich in any way, nor are the friends I make here rich, I haven't once heard the statement, ""I can't afford it till my next paycheck"" when I ask someone to watch a movie with me or something.

I also have made zero American friends here because every time I meet one here and try to talk to them I realize it's the same thing all over again - they love talking about themselves but don't even bother asking my name or background.

It's really weird to say but in a foreign country I have zero roots with, no family here nor is the language familiar to me, and friends I just met these past few months, I finally feel like I belong again."

I am a blind adult living with my mother and working an unpaid volunteer job at my local library. I've been trying to seek paid employement for quite a while with the help from a vocational rehabilitation counselor. Long story short, my previous counselor assigned me to a new one, whom I had monthly phone meetings. I liked the idea, because it kept me motivated to continue my job search. Our last meeting was this passed September, and I stopped my search and, for watever reason, never reached out to my new counselor to schedule our next meeting.

This morning, my previous counselor emailed me, saying she was closing my case this week. I have no one to blame but my self. Self-motivation has always been a struggle. For a while, I'll do very well, then suddenly come to a screeching halt. I'll ask myself, ""Do you really want to get a job, to eventually get paid and live on your own?"" One half of my brain says yes, but my actions clearly say otherwise. I know I can do better, I've proven this to myself countless times. For example, my volunteer job involves me listening to audiobooks and rating them on the amounts of profanity, violence, and sex they have. I usually complete a book per week and set my own hours, so I can commit to something and do my best to get it done. I even managed to get an interview two years prior.

I liken all this to laziness and anxiety. Plus, I feel I waisted my counselor's time and services. I know I'm the problem, I know I can do better, but when I put myself in a rut, it's hard to get out, so...do I really want to try again...and can I trust myself to actually stick to it this time? Honestly...I'm not sure.

The same applies to becoming more active. I have blotchy feet. For the first half of this year, I'd get up about every hour and walk around a bit. The blotchiness improved, but then...I just stopped, resulting in it getting worse."

I am not in a good relationship. I know I have settled for the bare minimum I could find because I didn't want to be alone and it's my only option. I am self aware about how much of a painfully shitty relationship this is, but I can't ever bring myself to do anything about it. 

He's been abusive since the start, just getting more severe over time. I have completely lost myself and become a person I hate who has practically no empathy and frequently struggles to look at my partner or even other people in a remotely positive light. I barely like physical intimacy anymore on almost any level, and we haven't had sex in what must be coming up for a year now because I literally feel no drive to. Things happen daily that I feel like just flat out shouldn't happen in a good relationship, but I've become too worn down to care, making me also retaliate in ways that I never would have in the past which disgusts me. There is all of this and so much more so why can't I just leave? It makes no sense, right? And it's frankly degrading that I still put up with this and it makes me feel disgusting beyond belief.

However, at the end of the day, I know there's nothing else out there for me. Now, I'm not saying I couldn't deal with being single for a while, that's fine, and would probably be healthy. The problem is I genuinely, wholeheartedly believe I would *never* find anyone else willing to be with someone like me. I would be permanently alone until I die and that thought is so depressing that I will likely never act on any of this. 

I understand people frequently say things like this, all the while they're still amazing, beautiful people with lots of plusses in their perceived negatives that outweigh them, and it's more of a self confidence issue. But I have spent a lot of time thinking about this as logically as I possibly can and I think I'm 100% correct in thinking these things. I just have too many issues, too many things weighing me down that no sane person would actually want to be with me.

I have a few mental health issues, and I have never been able to work as a result and probably won't for the foreseeable future. Socialising and going out is also incredibly hard, and I still live with my parents at almost 24 years of age. Even if I wanted to move out (and trust me, the toxicity coming from them is more than enough to make me want to) I will probably never have to opportunity to do so on my own. I sometimes get so depressed that I don't shower for a week, or my anxiety is too bad to even leave my bedroom. I have skin issues that flair up randomly to the point that I don't want to even be looked at, let alone touched, and I look like absolute shit most of the time. Some of these things might have been more acceptable the last time I was dating; I was a teenager, there weren't as many standards or expectations. But I am technically an adult now, as terrifying as that is, and these sorts of things can't simply be looked over any more. 

I keep asking myself, what about any of that is appealing in a partner? I understand that you're supposed to ""work on yourself"" first, but some of those things genuinely aren't going away so, what, I'm supposed to just miraculously find a guy who will support me in all of those ways? Even if I could somehow, I would feel like too much of a burden for that, let alone how pathetic they would view me as. They could have any number of normal, functioning people in the world and for some reason they'd still pick this? It's just not going to happen, is it. Realistically, what I'm in now is all I'm ever likely to get, and that isn't a self confidence issue, that's just fact.

I'm not even really sure why I'm writing this to be honest, but I guess the point of this is to just vent, right. It's been rough lately and it's only going to get rougher, so I guess I just needed somewhere to shout things out before I go crazy. Hell, it's just gone 4am but I'm doing this instead of sleeping because I don't want to be alone with my thoughts right now. This is me, this is my life, and I should probably just suck it up. God, this whole post is pathetic. If you've made it this far into these ramblings, I can only apologise."

I’m an extremely flawed person who I would consider to be fundamentally broken. Not at my core, but still broken. And I’ve loved and lost a lot of good people in my time… I just want to love someone but that hasn’t happened and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe I’m subconsciously running from something and it’s showing. It’s sad to admit, but I live vicariously through video games and books. The emotions, the jokes, the banter between characters, all of it I feel with them. It’s really nice to escape and watch people live the lives you wish you had. Having someone always being there, growing together, loving and pushing to be better. I guess what I’m getting at is I want my own person. I want someone to talk to whenever and joke with. I want someone in my life that I know I can fall in love with. I just haven’t had that happen to me, and it’s heartbreaking. 
At the end of the game the two main characters don’t even meet up or get together. The message is you can’t run from your problems so life sucks? Is that really all there is to it? What’s the point of going through chapters in your life and meeting new people if they’re not going to stay? You get what you want out of someone for a part of your life then move on? I don’t want my life to be like that. What’s the point of life if at the end of the day you have nothing to go home to? The truth about life is that nothing is ever going to live up to our expectations and now matter what, we are always going to be left disappointed. It feels like I’m so far behind everyone else. Not everyone gets the happy ending that’s right for them. And I’m terrified I’m one of those people. My best friend is getting married in a couple years, my sister is getting married in may. And I have nothing to show for myself. I never worked a real job, I’ve only ever done volunteer work. I struggle a lot, but I still consider myself a funny and very caring person who has a lot of love to give. I just don’t know why no one I’ve met wanted that. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why I feel so much emotion over little things like books movies and video games. I try so hard to be so happy and don’t have anything to show. I don’t know how I feel, just that I’m waiting for life to start and that I’m in what feels like a state of limbo. It’s so easy for me to think there’s no one out there for me, or that something is wrong with me and I’m going to go about my life continuing to watch others be happy. What’s the point of going through life if what you end up getting doesn’t meet your expectations? I just want to feel like everything is going to be okay. 
I clearly have a lot going on and just needed to get stuff off my plate, so if you’ve read this whole thing thanks a ton, because honestly I don’t know what I’m doing or where I’m going in my life. Or what the point of everything was. And that really sucks. Thanks again, and I hope you’re doing well. Peace"
rrrym0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rrrym0/sooo_im_about_to_get_kicked_out_of_college/,Sooo I'm about to get kicked out of college...,1,1,1640837020.0,"It all started when I graduated high school back in may 2020. Everything was perfectly lined up for my ""bright future"". I got accepted to GSU and was very happy about it because it was the school I was hoping to get into the most. Under one condition though: I had to take a success program to get in which required me to take classes during summer. I have never done anything school related in summers and this one was no different although I intended it to be different. My grandfather passed away during my time, I was looking for a job at the time and got into that stupid Vector Marketing aka CUTCO plan for work. It took up 2 weeks of the 7 weeks I had in my summer courses and the pay wasn't really worth it either. After I quit, I kept not doing the work I was supposed to and ended up with a 0.43 GPA. Yea I know, pretty f*cked up. Well next semester comes by and I thought I was gonna get kicked because my GPA is lower than a 2.00 then I had to fill out a form of ""Academic Improvement Plan"" to stay in the university. Then I failed some classes AGAIN. but my GPA did get higher and I had 2 more semesters to improve it even further. Well fastforward to now I AM ABOUT TO BE KICKED THE F*CK OUT. My parents don't even know about this and I know how hurt they will be when they find out. I don't even know what I did wrong this semester, Sure I skipped some classes here and there but this was the only semester where I did literally ALL my assignments for ALL my classes yet somehow I still managed to fail a class. I have caring parents who believe in me and think of me as this genius that I'm not. I have had a conversation with them telling them that I'm not doing good in college but never mentioned the possibility of getting kicked out. I am so scared, concerned, worried, and confused now that it's happening, feels like I literally gave up my life in the past 2 years. I don't know what I will do if I get kicked out. I had this near perfect life in high school but now I'm border-line committing suicide because of this😔. This feels so wrong, it feels like I don't have a purpose in anyones life. My poor parents left their reputation and jobs in Iran and moved here to provide me with the best opportunities and I have officially f*cked up every single opportunity I had. My mom was so happy when she found out that I'm going to GSU and she was so excited but now I completely messed it up and I feel like she would not be any more hurt than she would if she found out I committed suicide. I do not have a purpose other than hurting the people that believed in me not just my mom; my dad, my family in Iran, my friends, all of which think of me as someone who has it ""all figured out"" I constantly feel like I'm a let down to all those people. I still cannot understand how I turned my perfect life all the way upside down, full 180° turn into a shithole that it is today. I went from ""thank you god for everything🙏"" to ""please take me to hell right now! I need to pay for what I've done"" I lived and acted like nothing happened knowing that I'm lying to my parents' face and all they're trying to do is make sure I'm okay. I feel so bad for my parents. Why do they deserve to have such a f*cking disappointment as their child, they deserve a way better child than me. No-one deserves to be hurt so much because they decided to have a kid. I don't deserve my parents because of how horrible of a person I am and they don't deserve me because of how kind and caring they both are😪. If you are in school and doing well, thank the lord and never stop, don't make the same mistakes I did, I wanted to put this out there because it might be the last thing I will ever do in this world.
Sorry maman
Sorry baba

I failed this beautiful life you made for me💔"

Its a box that people put themselves in thats not really there and yet everyone else just goes alone and no one ever has a good reason why.  


I do not understand the offense people take to other peoples actions or lack of certain pnes in public.  

Thankfully ive learned over the years to avoid these instances myself and I follow the social script pretty well, but even when my behavior is perfect for a given situation I usually have no idea why I have to act a certain way.

Growing up, i was a favourite of everyone in the neighbourhood and even with relatives. 
Everybody still talks about how extraordinary of a child i was, but honestly i found it hard to comprehend this because my gut told me something different and i absolutely had no recollection of my childhood days whatsoever. I found it weird that i didnt remember much of that amazing childhood i had. My memories seem to begun from my mid-teens. 

Recently i started a self- healing and self-awareness journey and i just suddenly remembered counts of me being bullied. The thing is i started school earlier than others, 2 years to be precise. 
I was in doubt first but it became more clear that i wasnt imagining things. 

I remember how she twisted my fingers and how she ruined my homework because i was better than her in studies, i remember how i had my food taken, i remember how i was called names and i certainly do remember how that child had one hell of a bad breathe. 

I just dont know how to comprehend this. It stirred me up. Like i really was convinced by others i was the happiest and brightest child. I guess i never shared this with anyone before even as a child. This explains why bullying triggers me so much. 

And i cant help but feel like i have some other traumas that i subconciously chose to block so as to not hurt myself. I still dont remember much details from high school or middle school and am only 21.

Am scared as hell."

I can never get out and it feels like I can’t breath. I feel overwhelmed by almost everything that has bad emotions tied with it.

My younger sister calls me a horrible sister even though I try my best to make her happy even if I’m not happy myself. It all just hurts, and I’m already in so much pain. Even on my good days I feel like being alone and wanting to be in a corner alone. My parents didn’t realize for the longest time that I was in a lot of emotional pain but even when they did realize it only my mother excepted it. My father denies me having any emotional issues and says I make things up and I’m overly dramatic and start fight for no reason he’s told me hurtful things like “this is why you don’t have friends” and “your just a child you don’t know about things” he always tells me he loves me but he never try’s to ask me how I felt about things and he’s told me “why don’t you care about I felt?” I honestly feel like trash because it always feels like I’m not good enough. Both of my siblings are straight A-B students while I’m barely passing some classes. My mother tells me she feels like I can do better, and I try but I don’t have the energy to do so. I had a mental breakdown at a concert because someone accidentally took my instrument and a upperclassman told me I was being dramatic and I responded with not so kind words because it felt like the end of the world. most people don’t believe me when I tell them my grade hates me. I’m basically shunned for no reason besides rumors. I just can’t get away from everything and it’s tugging me down. I just feel like I’m at my limit with all of this.

How are people so clueless about their surroundings and touching other people? It's basic etiquette to leave space. Whenever I go out in public and get in a long line, I see people who consistently try to stand less than a foot behind others and it really grinds my gears."

A big part of this is due to his hoarding problem. But during the pandemic, he lived with / off of her as she didn’t kick him out as the financial burden would fall on us kids. A lot of things were collected in her house during their marriage & during the pandemic. 

Me and my siblings are still mourning the death of our dad. It’s really hard to go through his numerous possessions. Prior to his passing, we all were making several efforts to clean up my mom’s house. But post his death, it’s been incredibly difficult to go through his things. My mom has taken the liberty of going through his room & emptying it out, which is great & super helpful. But in the process, is destroying a lot of his favorite shirts and things. I think she takes a lot of joy in cleaning out his stuff.

I don’t blame her, bc she’s wanted a clean house for so long. But when I ask her to save an item for me or my sister, she asks me why we were so eager to clean before, and now we aren’t. 
I feel like the answer is fairly obvious - our dad just died so throwing out his possessions is incredibly difficult. But she doesn’t see it that way. When I try to make her see reason, she starts talking about her own death and tries to guilt trip us. 

I don’t know what is right in this situation, or what to do. I know me & my sister have to go through all his things eventually but it’s so hard…"

It's my life, it's not like anyone can hop on in my brain and unfuck things for me. But oh well, let's get on with the post. Also, two important things. 1. I do not live in the USA. 2. If you recognize my story, no you do not. I'm anonymous.

It started when I was about 17(F). Of course, it'd never relly been good but that's when shit really hit the fan, and I'm still trying to clean it off the wall. Anyways. I got hit with first an event that triggered an eating disorder (yeah that one) which already got me quite vulnerable and then a few months later a really, really traumatic event happened and I was essentially left alone and depressed. I can't really remember those month's but I remember feeling empty, crying a lot, etc. This was when I was just turned 18 so I didn't have any psychiatrist or anything because I hadn't gotten to meet a psychiatrist for adults yet.

So I did what I could do, the only thing. I endured. I focused on my graduation (june 2020, this period was spring 2019). I honestly didn't think I would graduate. It felt so surreal that I would be alive and that my grades would be good enough. But, uh, I did. And I was happy at first but then I realized I didn't have any plans from now on, except ambitions (dream job). Fucked around until fall2020, when I decided to apply for a course in said field, and I loved it. But that was only for half a year (spring term 21) and I remember thinking about a job but apparently it's really, really hard when you're autistic and socially dumb. It's embarrassing how awful I am in IRL socialization.

So... ever since june21 I've been sitting around at home, doing nothing. And I have a job coach (guy who's helping me applying for jobs) and he does his job amazingly, and gives me little lists on what to do. But apparently my brain is fried because I fucking can't! And it's awful how he gives me tasks to do and it's not even hard tasks but I can't even do them. So I just sit at home. I don't even sit atound, I lie in my fucking bed and doomscroll on my phone, or devote my time to video games (big passion of life aka oniy thing thats kept me going).

The worst part is my little sister (F19, with a DL and a job and studying) has been making little comments about how I'm ""just sitting at home all day"" which obviously is true but it hurts because I feel like she's looking down on me.

I can't actually be arse to write a TL;DR it's 03.25 and I'm kinda crying rn cheers ty for reading"

I don't know. But it's bugging me.
So, last year, when I was 19, I joined a groupchat about a specific fandom I was in. This groupchat included a girl around my age, and two 16-year-olds. We all bonded really quickly, and me and the other girl my age got a sort of older sibling relationship with the younger two.
However, the two younger ones would frequently say NSFW stuff about characters in the fandom they found attractive. This included sending fanfics and fanart that were NSFW. It made me uncomfortable because, well, I was 19 and these two were like little siblings to me so having them share that stuff with me didn't sit right.
But I didn't know what to say, and because the other girl didn't say anything I assumed maybe I was overreacting or just being a prude. So whenever they'd talk about NSFW stuff I'd just either ignore the chat, or try to change the subject/make a joke about it (how I cope with being uncomfortable.)
I guess I was scared that if I said the wrong thing I'd ruin things, since these were the first real friends I'd had in a while. 
The talk about NSFW stuff didn't last very long, the problem just sort of solved itself and they stopped doing it. But it still bothers me to this day. I'm still friends with one of them, and the other doesn't use social media anymore due to unrelated reasons that I won't go into for her privacy. I don't know if I should mention it or not to my friend. I feel like I need to apologize to him for not being open and saying I felt uncomfortable. Again, we have a strong familial bond, and I feel like I wasn't there for him like I should've been. But at the same time it hasn't happened in ages so maybe bringing it up would just cause problems.

I think another aspect that bugs me is just the fact that I tend to let so many things slide because I convince myself I'm ""overreacting."" But this made me realize I need to trust my gut. It was inappropriate and I should have spoken up, but I just stayed quiet, and I'm mad at myself for that. 

I'm sorry if this is all jumbled, by the way. I just needed to vent."

Thing is, i got these friends that i like a lot, they're great friends and i've had lots of fun with them. We'll call them A and B because i don't want to say any name.We're speaking a lot on discord, playing game etc. But A decided to start speaking to one of his old friends on his own discord server before that was okay, atleast for me. The thing is, he started leaving me and B behind and spoke a lot more often on his new friend (we'll call it C) and his friends, so me and B are feeling kind of left alone. Thing is, i tried speaking to them too, but first off, they're kind of toxic in a way, kinda elitist and judgmental, atleast that's how i feel about them. Second , literally everyone there love A, so me and B are feeling even more left alone because he speak a lot with them and have a lot of fun. Fun, we don't have anymore,

and lastly.

**I'm just f\*cking jealous**

&#x200B;

As someone traumatized by my past, seeing my friends getting appreciated by everyone while i'm trying my best to even engage in a discussion with someone is making me mad, why can't i be like him ? Why can't i make everyone laugh ? Why doesn't everyone there (C and his friends) appreciate me, i just don't understand and it's making me so fucking sad and lost for some reason.

So yeah, kinda selfish but that's something i had to get off my chest. Thanks for reading everything"

I'm deeply scarred by what you're about to read and haven't opened up to anyone about it.

As a young boy, I sometimes hung out with an older boy. We'd often go to places like old sheds and woodland. One time, I remember him randomly masturbating in front of me. I believe it happened more times but I can't remember well. He was older than me and fully developed. I remember feeling confused and not knowing how to act.

Fast forward to another time when we were hiding out in a den that we were making. I remember being led down and him 'coming on to me'. He took out my penis and went to put it in his mouth. I remember him asking if I wanted to, but I was unsure what to do or say. He proceeded before I told him that I had to go and suddenly rushed off. I can't remember my exact age, although I do remember it stinging while he was touching me, thus I was still sexually underdeveloped. At a guess, I would say I'd have been around 8 or so but maybe older. He must have been 14 or 15 at that time.

Fast forward again to a time that I was around 12 or 13, I can't remember exactly. One day while at home with the child of a family friend, a young boy of about 3 to 4 years old, I did something inconceivable. While he was in my room, I lowered his trousers and put his penis into my mouth. It must have only been for a few seconds while he stood there. I don't recall any attraction or even why I did it, I just remember that I simply went ahead and did it on an impulse, without thinking at all. Nothing else happened afterwards and I never did anything of that particular kind again, however to compound the depravity, around the same age I also experimented sexually with my pet dog. I tired a few bizarre things, not involving penetration, but extremely gross nonetheless. They did not hurt the dog. Again, there was no thought process, simply acting out. I do remember that I was highly sexual at this point, with strong urges.

Moving forward from these experiences, nothing of the like happened ever again. I grew up, became a popular and good looking guy with no attraction to anything other than the opposite sex. Not even for a fleeting moment. However the memories of these past experience have remained, often buried for large chunks of my life but sometimes resurfacing and completely bringing me my knees. I feel disgust, regret, remorse... As an adult I consider myself positive, empathetic, loving... people really like my company, I have meaningful relationships and I always want to be the best person I can, yet the dissonance I experience when these memories surface almost always lead to complete and utter despair. It's disgusting, how could I have done things like that? I mean what the actual fuck. I think about the way I would be ostracised and derided if everyone knew. It often leads to thoughts of suicide, but recently it's been ridiculous. I don't know how to move past it. Since then and until now, I've lived a relatively normal life, but after this current episode, I am wondering if I really deserve decent relationships. Who would want to be friends if they knew of my past. I've been thinking about these experiences a lot during lockdown and it's leading me to despair.

I've tried being a rational adult about it and all I can come up with is that somehow the things that happened to me as a child played a defining role, however I hesitate as I don't want to deflect responsibility. It is probably also relevant to mention that I was emotionally abused and bullied constantly by my stepfather growing up, up until around the age of 13 or 14 when I moved out to be with a relative (I couldn't take it anymore).

Anyway, I'm going on and on. I just really needed to get this off my chest. I just want to have a normal life without being disgusted by myself. I turned out quite well considering the absolute shit-show that my stepfather subjected me to; I developed a strong moral compass and sense of empathy. I've always gotten on well with people and am well liked. But damn, if they knew about these mistakes..."

On one hand I’m really glad that they don’t have to find a way to live without each other. They are best friends and my nightmare was wondering how my mum would cope without her soul mate.

On the other hand, I’m grieving for the loss of times that I know we will never have. My last trip shopping with my mum. The last time we chatted on the sofa. 

Today I sat with her in hospital for a few hours and she pushed me to go home and spend time with my boyfriend. I called him to come collect me. Then as I put my hoodie on to leave she says “I wish you didn’t have to go.” It killed me. 

I don’t know. I have no point to all this but to ramble. I’m in shock. I’m overwhelmed. I’m trying to make sense of it all. Just 6 months ago my mum was seemingly fit and well. And now we’re sorting funerals. It’s just all, so wrong."

This past summer he stayed at my house for the summer. We’ve always slept together since we were kids but this time around we cuddled, and we started making out and it got a bit sexual. Besides the sexual stuff (making out and stuff) we always had that romantic kind of thing going on (kisses, hugs, saying we love each other) and that was our day to day basics for the 2 weeks that he spend at my house. 

He left and he was really depressed and sad about leaving me, he felt as if he was in a relationship and went through a break up, i was sad but maybe not as affected at the time as he was, however, i cant help but miss him everyday i have to go to sleep, since im sleeping in “our” bed. 

For a couple of months i kept overthinking everything, i had this feeling that i maybe “ruined his life” or that made him do things he didn’t want to.  I asked him and he said that he was not forced to do anything, and everything that we did was w consent but that he was not very proud of what we did and that it was better to forget it and act like it never happened.

I sadly agreed, i cant force him, but i have this struggle where i go to sleep in out bed and cant help but to think about him…..

Recently, for the holiday’s he came to visit to my grandma’s small town and i was very very nervous, i didn’t know how to act and it was awkward at first, the first night he asked for me to sleep with him, when everyone was asleep we hugged, cuddled and history repeated herself…. 

This happened for 2 days, and i couldn’t help but to feel way to many emotions, now he left and i feel empty, i love him and i know that he loves me, at times i feel like he just wants me and sees me as someone who he can get it off with, since he just came out and wants to keep it DL but at the same time he really seems to love me but don’t want a relationship since we live far away and we are relatives. (ps. he’s my cousin’s son) 

I just feel a very strong connection to him, i feel empty and i don’t know what to do, is just too many emotions. What can i do?!?!"

I’m mentally ill and people KNOW, but as I’ve gotten into my 20’s I’ve fully learned to mask it. No one cared when I didnt. They see my suicide attempts and self harm as selfish. If I ever were to do it, it would be in a as convenient as possible way for others around me.

I would have been wrapped around and dead if I was a meter closer

The second one being shortly after when my dad and grandfather used his truck to pull my car out. My dad told me to stand at the top of the hill and warn people about the cars on the road to watch out for us moving my car. Someone came up when I was just about to stand at the top of the hill. He was going far too fast and hit the ditch to dodge me. And bounced right out. Yelled ""sorry buddy"" at me and drove away. 

Probably because his car did not have any legal stuff on it like insurance and registration. Didn't even stop to see if I was ok. He didn't want any cops. I would have been over top the car and dead if he hit me

Needless to say I am no longer taking that road. And taking the long way around. And to hell with that guy who almost killed me"

The thing is - I understand where these tantrums come from, but I don’t have the capacity to respond positively when it happens at least twice an hour. These meltdown are the “I’d expect cps to show up” kind of screaming and there’s no chance of reasoning with them.  It’s not like I’m just not good at responding to bad behavior, it’s that bad behavior is their only way of being.

Add on the sleepless nights even with a routine of two or three bedtime stories… before screaming at me for an hour. 

I’m 32 and people always say “it’s such a great thing you’re doing.” Honestly, I feel bad for these children, but this experience shows me I never want to have my own kids.  It’s been the worst experience and I don’t want to always be simmeringly furious but unable to express it because they’re goddamned kids. It’s not a worthwhile experience and I derive zero pleasure from knowing they’re better off."

Family life is shit and they're the ones that bring me joy, and lately I've been getting the runaround without follow up so I'm done chasing people.

I love my friends. They are literally what brings me joy and connection in the world, especially because I'm not close to my parents (who constantly fight and have their own mental health issues) and my one sibling that still lives at home (we are currently not speaking to each other). I often feel lonely at home, especially during COVID and now that I've graduated university and my friends are all over the city. 

Since I can remember, I've been the instigator of hangouts & phone calls. I take the onus to organize hangouts, conversations, sending gifts to far away friends etc because I don't want to wait around for things to happen if I want to connect with people. Even though I work a full time job and part time job!!! But I'm f*cking exhausted. It takes so much of my energy to ALWAYS be the one asking people to hang out, to ALWAYS initiate calls and conversations and follow-ups. I've reached the point where I feel like im chasing everyone for their time and I'm over it. I absolutely understand that people have separate lives apart from me, that people are burnt out and wanting to rest etc. I spend lots of time on my own finding things that bring me joy - but this has been a pattern for a while with some of my friends and I'm so over it. I've spent the last few days crying over how lonely I feel, feeling pathetic over doing so, getting angry at myself and them for acting this way. Obviously my love language is spending time with others, especially when I feel disconnected and isolated at home and for them to put in no effort when I've mentioned this before, hurts my feelings. I know I'm not the centre of anyone's lives, but I always try MY best to reach out to my friends and make them feel cared for, it would be nice to get the same in return.

After having 4 friends give me the run around about hanging out this week, I'm literally done and will not initiate convo with anyone. And before anyone says oh it's COVID, things are different - it's been like this even when cases were low and they were seeing everyone else."
rrpbci,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rrpbci/i_hate_when_people_touch_my_food_and_me/,I hate when people touch my food and me,2,0,1640829362.0,"My Grandma is staying with me and my Dad because of some plumbing stuff getting done at her place. I love my Grandma to death but sometimes she drives me insane. And it's because she wants me to hug her and to a lesser degree because she touched food that was mine. 

I dislike being touched by most people. I only ever really let my Dad hug me and I held hands and hugged my ex girlfriend, but besides that? Being touched is something that makes my skin crawl. Grandma knows that. But she just always insists on giving me hugs and putting her hand on my leg. I dislike it immensely. I don't know why. It just makes me uncomfortable. As soon as I was old enough to realize I didn't have to hug people to greet them or tell them goodbye I stopped doing so. I can tolerate some touch, but hugs are just too much for me. I hate them. Yet my Grandma acts like that means I hate her. I don't hate her. I love my Nana, it's just the hugs and kisses she always wants make my skin crawl.

Grandma is also eating some of my leftovers right now and it's so stupid but I absolutely despise when people touch my food. It's gross. I don't wanna put something in my mouth that other people have touched with their hands. It makes me fucking furious because it just makes me not want to eat, and I feel bad being so mad because my Grandma is an old lady but GOD I just hate when people touch my food. I don't mind like giving people food off my plate and sharing? But like I have to hand the food off. Otherwise I literally can't eat what is on my plate. As far as I am concerned the food is now hers and I'm not eating it because I just can't do it.

I feel like an asshole for complaining or being mad at things like this, but I can't help it. It's not just my Grandma by the way it's anyone who does it. I just feel like an overdramatic loser who needs to toughen up. I've always been this way though. If I'm out with friends and someone touches my food? I literally just give them the plate. I don't eat. If someone hugs me or forces me to hug them out of social obligation? I'm tense and uncomfortable the whole night. I hate touch. I hate people touching my food. It makes me feel gross and sick. I just get like a little burst of being mad for a couple seconds, and then I have to stop myself from like letting it show. Then I just feel grossed out for a while thinking about other people's hands. It's honestly enough to make me not wanna eat for a day or two sometimes. And the hug stuff just makes me tense an uncomfortable around people.

I just feel gross but also like I'm mean and ungrateful and I just wish I could be a normal fucking person who isn't physically repulsed by stupid things."

I want to wear pretty/cute/hot tops too, and not have to wonder how in the world my chest is going to fit in them. I’m not big framed at all, but my chest makes buying clothes impossible and people stare, even though I wish they wouldn’t, I’m not doing anything even remotely sexual and I become sexualized.

I can’t even find my bra size at most places (36I) so I have to wear ill-fitting bras half the time.

Whenever I tell people I want a reduction of at least three cups sizes, they act like I just said I killed someone and try to talk me out of it since I am so ‘blessed’, and shouldn’t complain that I have big boobs since so many people want that. 

My back hurts, nothing fits properly, I can’t shop at most clothing places, most places don’t carry my bra size, I get sexualized for wearing a normal top, and I’m supposed to be happy with it.

That gift just really made me feel bad, even though it wasn’t my moms intention at all (she has a similar problem, but has gotten a reduction.)

Someone would tell me it's in my head and someone out there probably finds me beautiful. Not even my own parents or family or closest friends have ever even told me I'm pretty, let alone beautiful.

Then I see guys praising their women and saying that they're the most beautiful people on the planet. I wish my boyfriend thought that way of me. I get a few ""prettys"" from him every now and then, but I know he just doesn't want to hurt me. He fell for my personality (we met online) and he loves me, so he doesn't want to hurt me.

As of late it seems that everything in my life keeps me from being happy and this lack of happiness is mainly from a sense of loneliness. It mainly started at the beginning of the pandemic where I lost the privilege of seeing my friends everyday and once school started back up it felt like I realized how I wasn’t that important to a lot of my friends lives. For the whole time we were in lockdown a lot of people never texted me or kept up with me. It got way worse when I realized that for some of these people I was the only person they cut out or stop talking to. And then this year when I was already at my low the school unknowingly screwed me over even more. I had no classes with my last few friends so if I got to see them it was based purely on wether or not I walked passed them in the hall before or after class. And in my home room I shared that class with my best friend for two years and when we showed up the teacher there who clearly knew we were friends didn’t sit us next to each other so it basically meant for five minutes a day I could talk to my friend. And after all that happened I decided to drop out. I was already unhappy with my classes and what they were forcing me to learn and now they remove my social life there was nothing dragging me from leaving my bed in the morning.  And now I get to watch people I would talk too and spend hours at a time with have these amazing lives with there friends where I barely get the chance to see one of my friends in person.

A few years ago, I worked part-time at a crappy big box retail store.  I wasted my measly bi-weekly pay on trying to improve my wardrobe (utterly failed).  Any who, this one day I was returning a pair of jeans right after I bought them (lol).  I was in line and noticed this peculiar young woman.  She was pretty and well dressed, but one thing struck me as odd.  They had this very big smile on her face.  At first, I thought that she had to be stoned.  I kept seeing this woman walk back and forth between the back office and service desk.  That is when my small brain took a step back to think: Maybe she was trying to get a job, stoned?  Maybe she an employee trying to comfort customers with a friendly face whilst stoned?  I didn't care enough to stay on it, so I went back to minding my business. 

A couple minutes later, the back office door opened for the last time and I saw the weird lady walk out with the same dumb ass smile on her face.  I was expecting her to just walk by me but ffs, she decided to stop and looked at me for a entire minute before leaving.  It was kind of intense.  I felt like she was trying to get my attention or maybe she was thinking, ""Dang you a ugly mf...."" Oh well."

Her and I are in a relationship for something like 3 years, now. Her and J started dating 1,5 year ago. J and I are good friends.

Her and I are living together, but J comes from time to time. 

I love her to death. I do anything to make her happy, and I know she does the same for me. But lately, it’s been quite difficult for me to handle J’s presence. He’s being here a lot more since a few months, and I feel like I’m just becoming a third wheel.

It’s normal that he’s coming often. He’s currently preparing himself to enter the army, thus, he wants to spend the most time he could with her. I’m feeling left out because of that, but I’m working on these feelings because I know that it’s just jealousy. GF loves him dearly, and I’m afraid I might start resent them both for their bond. I think she loves me, of cours, but I doubt it a lot, since J has something that I don’t have.

I’m a sex-repulsed asexual. He is not.  

Thus, it’s normal for them to spend intimate times together, and I don’t mind that at all. But I’m sometimes really uncomfortable when I hang out with them, because their PDA make me think that they’ll start to want some privacy, and that I should just go, which I do, as I don’t want to bother them. There are also times when I feel like I’m not supposed to be there. I don’t really know why, I just feel like I shouldn’t stay with them, as I’m not where I should be.

Since the beginning of their relationship, I couldn’t stop me from thinking that they fell in love and became a couple just because I wasn’t enough for her, and this thought still bothers me today. I try not to think about it most of the time, but when I’m alone in my room, as they share the same one when they’re together, I can’t help thinking about it. GF and I talked about that a lot, but seeing how sad and upset it makes her, I prefer not to do it now. I don’t want her to feel bad because of me, and neither do I want to make J feel bad because of my stupidity.

It might also have to do with the fact that GF doesn’t really show her love physically, (even though I see how hard she’s trying to make progress with that), and that when J is here, they always make physical contact. I know it’s because he initiates it, but I feel left out, because I don’t want to pressure her into giving me physical affection. I hug her at least a few times a day, but we don’t kiss often. And they are always hugging and kissing. 

My feeling might also have to do with a few stupids anecdotes, like the time when they were supposed to wait for me before taking a walk we were supposed to take together, and I found out they were in a middle of sexy session when I came back (which lasted really late, delaying our program), or when I hugged them both after leaving home for a week and J licked GF neck during the hug.

I just feel like I’m not enough, and that I’m bothering them. That they would be perfectly happy without me, and I’m just some kind of burden they carry around because it won’t leave them. I feel awful writing that down, I’m afraid I might subconsciously depict them as the monsters they aren’t, but maybe if I vent this, I might feel better and forget all about that."

I'm tired of questioning my gender and wishing i was a girl because I lost all of my confidence as a man.

I'm tired of wishing I was a woman so I can feel good enough for other women. 

I'm tired of not believing people when they say they're attracted to men, or me. Because I see so many people body shame men to the point where the idea of people even liking men is an imaginary concept to me, even though I'm bisexual myself. 

I'm tired of fearing of being in relationships with people  because I'm scared they'll start talking so high about women yet so low about men, and me. 

I'm tired of fucking crying about my horrific insecurities. 

I'm tired of this constant gender envy I get from women. I'm literally jealous of them. I'm so fucking jealous of women. 

I'm tired of trying to find a therapist because it seems like such a dumb issue but it affects me so much. 

I'm tired of looking into a mirror and almost crying because I don't have the ""soft skin and lips and hourglass figure"" a woman has

I miss appreciating a women's beauty. Every time I look at a beautiful girl, I used to appreciate how beautiful she is. But now, I feel nothing but depression and jealousy. 

I miss being confident around women, thinking atleast one will find me attractive as a man. But how can I be confident anymore when so many people basically view men as trolls and pigs and women as goddesses? 

Whenever I see a beautiful woman I want to talk to my mind now goes ""she's probably gonna be disgusted by me, as a hairy man. I don't have soft skin and huge tits, or this or that"" 

Everytime some says ""women do *whatever* better"" I get so fucking mad it drives me crazy""

God like 30 minutes ago I cried so fucking hard and I still have a headache. I had to cover my mouth not to make noise.

Look, I know not all bisexual people are like this, but god fucking damn, I see this so much. I literally see misandry in the community more than anything else. The only joke besides the bicycle joke in the community is the guilt of being attracted to men. And it's always ""it's just a joke"" they think they're so fucking hilarious 

My mind is so fucked right now.
I wish I felt good enough again. I wish I felt confident again. I just wish someone would love me and be attracted to me without comparing me to anyone else. 

Please don't take this as an attack towards bisexual women and bisexuals in general. I'm just venting to try to make myself feel better."

I've always been an anxious person but I felt it was over normal things to worry or stress about. Like deadlines at work, weirdos on the bus, or the car breaking down. But now...I can't help but feel that my anxiety is getting out of hand and everybody around me has had enough of me. They all think it's in my head.

Toward the end of July, I got a panic attack after feeling off and my temp being high. I panicked thinking it was COVID and started crying. The way my boyfriend and parent's handled it made it worse and I felt that at that point I never controlled my life. After two days of throwing up and a high resting heart rate, I went to the ER. Everything came back ok. My TSH came back a bit higher than my usual levels. My WBC count was also a bit low. I was told I was ok and it was just dehydration and anxiety. After this ER trip, I whole week of insomnia. I slept nothing and kept feeling horrible symptoms. From a racing heart, to feeling jolts of adrenaline across my face/chest, to a tingly sensation on my scalp, to feeling nauseous...I felt like I was going crazy and dying. After drinking some valerian root tee i was able to sleep after 7 days. 

Got a new PCP in August and she ran the usual blood work and everything came out fine. Went to a cardiologist, got a EKG, heart echo, and wore a 24 heart monitor. Both doctors said I was ok. Even though my heart rate fluctuates so much when I lay down, sit, and stand up. But just anxiety, unfit, and dehydration. Even the GI doctor said the same thing. 

I eventually saw a new gyno in November. I told her how irregular my periods were growing up and that all my doctors/gynos said that was totally fine. I also mentioned a new freckle that appeared on my labia. My new gyno ordered me to get some hormones checked and an ultrasound. Blood work came out ok. I just had my ultrasound and my biggest fears and my years long suspicion has been confirmed, I most likely have PCOS. 

In November, I also got an eye exam with a local optometrist. I mentioned getting double vision and blurriness when I space out. After some testing, I was told I have diplopia and that I have very wavy blood vessels in my retinas. She said to check my blood pressure butt that's always fine. I asked for a referral for an opthalmologist but that's not till March...

Now...for the last four months my anxiety has been crazy. From normal anxiety to health anxiety...it's getting out of hand. My parent and boyfriend are completely burned out by me. I honestly don't feel like this is me. I feel something is wrong with me. I was perfectly fine before the panic attack back in July. I hate that everybody is telling me I'm different and not the same person. That I keep letting my anxiety rule my life. I know I've gotten obsessed with my health...but if I had never brought up PCOS to my new gyno I would have never gotten my hormones checked and gotten my ultrasound that showed signs of it! 

I feel my anxiety isn't as a result of my obsession but rather something hormonal or something inside me not working well. One thing was already proven. But i still feel so invalidated and made to feel crazy! 

Now I am worried about losing my fertility. My bf thinks it's too much to go seek answers now. I think its best to figure out what hormones are out of tune and get them fixed now...rather than later. If my anxiety is hormonal...I feel like I'd have a hard time controlling that! Maybe get ting help will make me feel normal again. 

I'm tired...I've been very sad lately and don't feel like myself because I can't tell anyone about my fears without getting told to stop feeling that way. I just want to be heard and comforted... 😢"

As a child, you think of your parents as gods. They are “perfect people” whom you base being a good person on, and they are also the ones whom you seek love and validation from.

Since I finished med school and am staying at home now, I’m spending more time with my family than I did in the past nine years of my life (since moving out for college). Spending time with them just confirmed one thing: I’d have a better relationship with them if we lived apart.

My father is verbally abusive and narcissistic, refusing to acknowledge any other opinion outside his own as “right” and always seeking out drama. He is also incredibly irresponsible and living with him is stressful to say the least.

My mother, while there might not seem anything outwardly wrong with her, is not much better. Maybe my other siblings would have a different opinion, but I find her love to be very conditional. I think out of all my siblings, I’ve always felt she loved me least and that I always had to excel in something or give her something so I could be favored. I remember as a kid, I wrote about her favoritism in my diary. Immediately regretting it, I threw it in the trash and she found it and read it. Instead of reflecting on herself, she got angry with me and scolded me. I was nine. Looking back at it now, that was a terrible parenting move. Your child was feeling unloved and instead of approaching them to talk about it, you blame them for it and think it’s their fault? It even takes me back to the time when I was much younger and my mom went back from a shopping trip and brought home gifts for my older sister and younger sister (my 2 youngest siblings weren’t born yet), but none for me. My dad pointed out that she should’ve brought one for me too because I would be upset, and she fought back saying I wasn’t and even “confirmed” it with me, saying “You’re not upset, right?” to which I could only nod even though I was upset. I was more scared to get in trouble than I was to deny my emotions. After those events, I remember actively trying to suppress all negative emotions I had and deny them. It made for a very dysfunctional emotional processing mechanism, and I spent many years of my adult life ashamed of my negative emotions, when a lot of the time, what I felt in those moments were very much valid.

Even to this day, my mom’s favoritism is obvious (she favors my three younger siblings and talks shit about me and my older sister). I’ve kinda accepted it already but it doesn’t mean it still doesn’t bother me. 

Anyway, I’m planning to move out soon (abroad) to start my own life. What stresses me out now is her plan to move in with me once I settle down in another country. Initially, I thought it would be a good idea. I wanted to welcome my family, especially if I know that they’ll have a better life. But thinking about it now, I’m having second thoughts. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life being a breadwinner? I don’t mind sending money or allowance to my family members especially if I have some to spare, but to live with them, provide for them, and to meet all their needs is a different story. Also, wouldn’t this just be a repeat of how my mom treated my older sister when she had money? At the time, my sister always treated my family, and my mom’s actions towards her significantly improved. My older sister even said it herself. Wouldn’t the same happen to me? And wouldn’t it just further prove to me that her love is, as I’ve suspected, conditional? Do I really want to add salt into my own wounds?

Oh, I wonder how it feels to not have to feel like you have to earn your place at the table. I remember when I first told my mom about my plans to move abroad and to take them there with me (I was only half joking, but she took it literally). One of her first replies were, “You can’t marry anymore then,” as if to imply that I was going to be the one that was going to work hard to provide for their life there, and that I couldn’t live my own life. I honestly don’t even care to have a husband or even children, but hearing that comment just made me angry. It just confirmed that she would only love me if she gained something from me, and that made me angry, but moreso just hurt a lot. 

I don’t think my mom knows I even feel like this. But it’s not like anything will change if I bring it up. If anything, the same event that happened when I was nine will just repeat itself. My feelings will be denied, remain invalidated, and will just anger her and cause her to blame me. 

But what can I do, right? It is what it is. My parents are not the gods I thought of as a child. They are human, just like me, with many flaws and shortcomings. I can be angry, I can say that I’m disappointed that they didn’t turn out to be the people I expected them to be, and I can even cry and pity myself for it. But in the end, the truth remains. They are human and have their limitations. And I can only extend understanding and forgiveness towards their limitations and hope that other people will extend the same understanding and forgiveness for my own."

&#x200B;

I am 38M, my spouse (or ex) is 37F and we have two beautiful children together, a boy (5) and girl (3). 

&#x200B;

I'll try and make this free flowing and chronologically as accurate as I can. We've had been having marriage issues long before the seperation, and both had given our best efforts with counselling but it was her who decided one day we are done, and she wanted time apart. So I packed up my things and moved in with my parents that same day. Thankfully both sets are closeby and we don't have any issues there, although trying to explain to my parents when I rocked up on the doorstep was a bit tough. So I lived there up until around 4 months ago when I finally found my own place. I couldn't afford it initially as I was paying the mortgage and majority of the bills of my home (whilst not living in it) as my ex is in the first years of her new business and not making much. 

&#x200B;

She tells me around 3 months ago she has been seeing someone and is happy, which hurt, but I was happy that she was happy. I too had been on dates but nothing came from them. 

&#x200B;

It looks recently that things are starting to get serious with this new guy - both my kids have now met him and today they are on a day trip together with his kids, almost like a family day trip :( 

&#x200B;

I'm sitting here pretty heartbroken and lonely. But it's my own fault, ever since the seperation and probably before then, I've been on a path of self destruction, and don't know why. Abusing my ADHD meds, drinking, gambling and eating like garbage. I haven't been to the gym in over a month. What the f\*ck am I doing?? 

&#x200B;

I dont want sympathy or anything like that, I'm more writing this to as the sub states, to get it off my chest, but also to see if anyone has been in a similar situation. I feel like my ex:

&#x200B;

(a) Checked out of our marriage long before we even started counselling 

(b) Gets to live in a beautiful home, our home while I am stuck in this dingy 2 bedder apartment because its all I could afford

(c) Has found a nice guy and the kids like him and my family is being taken away from me

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant, but yeah. Life is getting me down at the moment :("

I dont know why i get it because i have two loving parents who let me express myself and grow , but i’ve been like this for 15 years!!

Ever since I can remember whenever I got into a new tv show i liked, or a fashion trend I’d like to follow, just little things I was always really embarrassed to ask or talk about it?


For an example I remember when I got into the band Fleetwood mac two years ago. I felt like I needed permission to actually listen to them and felt weird talking about it, I felt like I had to have approval to have interests?
Whenever I listened to one of their songs I got this cringey feeling like I was doing something bad or wrong?


Its now like  this with most stuff, like books I want to read.
I went to the bookstore with my parents yesterday and really wanted a certain book, but I was embarrassed to ask for it ? Like if I had said ‘hey, I’ve been thinking of reading this, it looks so good!’ Nobody would have cared in the end, but for me it’s like as if they’ll judge me forever ?? My finger was just right on the edge of the book and my whole life flashed before my eyes and I couldn’t bring myself to ask 🧐 


I can’t even choose a movie on netflix for myself without this feeling. I feel like I have to have somebody else choose it for me or give me permission. Tbh I only get let myself listen to bands I like if I can somehow manipulate another person into recommending it to me (does that make sense??)


I think it stems from my social anxiety but it’s just a reaally specific thing, I haven’t heard of anybody else having it."

I should probably go back to when this started, and how this all began. I originally discovered porn when I was 11 or so, and I mostly started off with pictures of nude models. I then went to normal porn, and stayed there. I discovered hentai, and this is what really itches at me. From when I was 12 to about 15 or 16, I watched a crap ton of hentai. I even watched some loli and shota material, but I never really thought of them as kids because they didn't really look like kids to me and it never really occured to me. When I was almost 17, I was on tiktok and someone made a video about how hentai was child porn, and this sent me on a massive spiral. At first, I confessed to my younger sister, who was a little grossed out and said I should see a therapist about it. It then turned into a whole thing where I couldn't see children because they made me nauseous, and I had to stay at least twenty feet away. I also have major fears that I may have watched csam in the past, and that I have forgotten. I feel like the fbi is going to bust down my door, and I want to go to a therapist about this but I am afraid I might be reported. I have never groomed anyone, never touched a child inappropriately, nor have I ever found any csam in my files, or have I ever searched it up. I know I have never watched any child porn because I don't know how to find any or know any videos or categories. Conversely, I do know how to find some loli or shota material. I feel like I am going insane, and that maybe I have harmed a child or watched csam and forgotten. I get triggered whenever someone says the word pedophile, or whenever someone mentions one getting arrested in the news. I don't feel like I should be around children, or that I should ever have any. I have done a crap ton of research on sex offenders recently, and I am so afraid that if I havent harmed a child or watched csam now, that I might abuse my power and harm a child or watch csam in the future. I have considered suicide for a while now, but I just can't do it. My siblings,(at least the two I have told), have said that I am not a predator nor will I be one in the future. Sometimes I wonder if I am lying to myself, and that it isn't OCD but really is just my true self. My worries about csam didn't even emerge until I read that article by Luke Malone about that kid Adam, and it mentioned a scenario in a csam video. For these last few months there have been a lot of highs and lows, for sometimes I feel rational and know I have never harmed any real children, and other times where I am worried that I will lose everything I have. I would report myself if I had real evidence that I have watched, or distributed csam in the past but there is no proof, and I have no way to make 100% sure that my delusions aren't real.

I asked their boyfriend and they said my friend was fine (we're not in contact anymore because of unrelated falling out). 

I know most people would say that's creepy. If so how do I properly take accountability and be a better person?

I'm not making excuses for my behavior at all. I just want to give the context that I was groomed at 17 by a 21-22 year old. I'm glad that this person is saying that they're fine but I just still feel bad and I don't want to hurt someone like I was hurt. I'm not sure if that whole situation warped my view of relationships?"

Also, this isn't some puritanical rant. I've paid creators on OnlyFans before when they were doing something interesting. But some dudes have me confused and angry. I'm so tired of seeing thin white gays get successful for making that kind of content. Especially when they're completely average. 

I saw a TikTok last night of a thin white gay saying he made enough on OnlyFans to pay his mortgage and I couldn't understand it because of how painfully average this guy was. I don't even know him but I truly hate him.

You'd see him on the street, maybe think ""oh he looks good"" but then go about your day and quickly forget him. What is he doing to make this much money?  I was enraged over it for the rest of the night. Do people really just think ""oh he's white and not fat so I'll pay to see his dick""?

I'm just so angry and sad about it because, to a lonely fat guy with money problems, it just looks like another thing that they get and I don't.

Edit: The nice thing about getting something off your chest is the mental clarity that comes after. I wrote this out of frustration and depression. The feeling is still there but I can't be mad at the guys finding success like this. It's not their fault. I don't really hate TikTok dude."

For example she owns her own house and pays the bills but she has no control over her thermostat. Her boyfriend thinks it’s more efficient to have the heat off and my mom is forced to sleep in her own house without heat during the winter. And in the summer she can’t use the AC because “it’s too expensive” and her boyfriend doesn’t want to pay that bill. 

He also doesn’t have a job. His job is buying NFTs but I don’t think it’s working out. He stays at home and smokes dab all day and gets upset if my mom tells him to do something because it “interferes with his set schedule”.

When she gets home from a long day of work she has to cater to him and do what he wants to do or else she is being rude. He calls her an idiot while they fight, constantly talks about how she needs to lose weight, and gets angry at her when something doesn’t go his way. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve told my mom to leave him multiple times throughout my life. They’ve been together for 10+ years but he’s tearing her apart.  

Yesterday when I went out with her to get dinner she told me that she said “he’s so mean to me”. But then she says “I guess I’ll just stick with him”. I told her there is someone better for her out there but I think she took that with a grain of salt.

We were together just over a year and I ended the relationship because I couldn’t deal with her rapidly worsening mental capacity. Her obit says she died last summer from assisted suicide after battling a rare form of dementia.

S and I were both in our 40s and divorced. She was an amazing person and honestly maybe the nicest soul I’ve ever met. We got along great and in another circumstance could see us together still.

My previous marriage was defined by my ex’s BPD and after I “escaped” I wanted to live the life I never could because of the drama and sickness.

When S started displaying much worsening signs of dementia/altzeimers, I got scared and didn’t want to become a caretaker so I ended things so I could live a better life. She understood but wanted distance so We never talked again.

I *am* living a better life. I have a wonderful fiance now and a healthy relationship where I am “living the dream”.

But S didn’t deserve any of this. I wish she could somehow be here with me. I miss her and regret how none of this is fair. I love what I have, but hate how I got here."

- no cutting and burning my skin
- no punching walls 
- no purging 

These are all habits I have developed for some time now to cope with my depression. Nowadays these are the only things I look forward to in life but deep down I know I’m gonna sink lower and lower if I don’t stop now. It’s gonna be difficult but I believe in myself. I almost gave in with punching a wall this afternoon after feeling intense anger and purging after binging a lot of food in the evening but in both cases, even though it was really difficult, I stopped and reminded myself that this didn’t really help me much in the past and sure as hell won’t be helpful now. In fact, it’s gonna make me want to do it even more because it’s so fucking addicting. Anyways, I’m gonna go to bed and can’t wait for days 2,3,4,5…etc to be a success as well."

I hope this point doesn't sound bad: but even someone worse off in life from me arguably has experienced more than I have, which to me is what life is about. I just sit around all day and don't really experience anything.

The amount of times I've tried to actually get up and do something and it's fallen by the wayside is staggering, but I'm just not living."

She graduated this year and is now doing adult tings. And honestly idk if I’m in love with her or not. It’s weird. Like I’m ok with being friends, I actually don’t mind. I wouldn’t make a move on her first just because I know the shit she’s been thru. But sometimes I feel like I really do like her. Like all I want for her is to succeed in life and to be happy. I care for her well-being just as much as mine. Im happy when I’m with her or just texting her and all the sappy stupid stuff. Now It’s weird not being in her life and it’s kind of lonely that she’s gone.

On a side note, I don’t have that many friends in college. A lot of people actually know me but I don’t have a really close friend group. I kinda fucked myself over cuz my first real friend group split up cuz of some complicated shit which left me in the middle :/ I didn’t try to make any new friends after that and just became that 5’5 buff asian that people saw at the school gym. Now I feel like I don’t have anyone that I can really talk to at school and it kinda sucks. 

Anyways, now I’m not really sure what to do. Idk if my feelings r actually because I love her or because I’m feeling lonely now that I’m kind of alone or because it’s the holidays. Idk how to put my feelings into words that well but I feel like I’m pretty self aware. Also sometimes I feel like I’m just being a needy friend. Pretty sure all of that did not make any sense but I hope someone responds, just want help sorting out my feelings or something idk."

I have friends that I talk to but I don't have any deep relationships. Just casual, friendly ones. I value them as friends but we're not very close. I have one or two best friends that I hang out with regularly, known them since I was a kid, but when they're busy with work or their significant others I'm at a loss.

Sometimes I get extremely upset that I'm not closer to any of my other friends. I value my best friends that I talk to pretty much every day but I wish I was able to get closer to other people, too. It's really out of my comfort zone to ask people to hang out, and even then I don't fully enjoy my time because I'm too anxious of being boring or too quiet or not sure what activity I could do with them. If I very rarely hang out with a real-life friend, I get incredibly anxious to the point of IBS and shaking before I meet up with them. There's this other person I know that tries to talk to me 24/7, and that backfires by making me incredibly annoyed because it takes away some of my alone time. I like talking to people but not 24/7 all the time every day!

I don't want to be annoying to anyone, so if I send them a message but they're too busy to reply I don't say anything else to bug them.

Basically I just wish I was more social and more confident. Realistically I'm not lonely, I'm very lucky to have some good friends, but sometimes I feel lonely. And sometimes I want to be alone. Most of the time I want to be alone because I'm scared of putting myself out there and being a bore or wasting my time.

tldr; I wish I was a social butterfly that had tons of super close friends to always hang out with confidently if I wanted to but I am just an extreme introvert that very rarely gets out of my comfort zone. Causes me some frustration. I'm also kind of hypocritical (if that's the right word to use)."

The porn industry is incredibly damaging to women.

It is common for actresses to be raped on-set. Often actresses will have their scenes changed once they are already penetrated:

It is common for an actress to not agree to anal, only to be anally raped on camera anyway. If she complains or fights back in any way, her career is ended and her reputation is destroyed from working in porn.

In the porn movie ""deep throat"" the actress was being raped at gunpoint. The gun is off-camera.

In most modern porn today, women are abused, degraded, slapped, choked, and spit on. They are violently anally degraded and hurt. 

Often the level of violence in porn scenes is the cause for actresses to have to ""retire"" in their 30s. Due to sexual organ prolapse. 

I will never understand how men can masturbate to the pain and discomfort of women who are being hurt and abused while they fake-moan in porn.  It's clear to me that for a man to consume porn he must see women as subhuman objects to fuck, dominate, and discard. 

Yet when men see this opinion, they lose their minds. They desperately try to defend masturbating to women being raped, abused and hurt. 

Even worse is the multitude of porn subs *devoted* to ""dead eyes,"" *devoted* to sadistic torture of women.

Even in normal, ""vanilla"" porn, It's awful. The woman fake-moans as she is flipped around like a living sex doll. The entire point of the porn is that she is a worthless object for him to use, dominate, and cum in / all over to further degrade her. 

And yet men argue this is normal. It's normal to watch hours of sexually using and torturing women.

It's not normal. It's deep hatred for women."

Not only that but one time at a hotel and playing by a pool (I can't swim and I was I think 8) I accidentally slipped on water and fell into the pool and I started drowning. I was gasping for air and I just heard my mother yelling and my brother pulled me out, I was coughing and trying to catch my breath. I legitamately thought I was going to die then. 

Ever since then what's also been stopping me from learning to swim is my Aquaphobia, I have a huge fear of being in open, deep waters where my feet don't touch the ground and part of that is from my drowning experience as a kid. Even pools that are 5ft deep, shallow and even hot tubs I'm just too scared to put my body in it. That's why I will never go to beaches or be near oceans and seas, I mean seeing pictures of them online when I'm safe at home with my feet on the solid floor it's fine bc I can admire their natural beauty on the internet but to see them in person and the thought of having to swim in them invokes major fear in me. I honestly don't even want to learn how to swim or get near big waters, pools, oceans etc. It's too scary..

But I actually do want to learn how to ride a bike someday but the issue is I have no one to teach me, I am alone and also with my SA (social anxiety) it might be useless because I'd feel too self conscious riding it outside in public."

But today I went on a trip with three of my classmates (2 dudes, 2 girls) and my good friend who is really well aware of my unrequitted love to her  started to touch her legs and they are now laying on each other. He never said he has also feelings for her. I understand that it is hard to say it to your friend.

So there it is, me in best friend zone, seeing them all lovey-dovey. I know its practically non of my business, but it hurts. It hurts so much. And I'm stuck there, I can't go anywhere to escape them. Just endure the pain. 

I needed to went all this here. Because no one will listen to me rn.

At the age of 20 I met this guy. We were the same age and met through a university sports club on a training weekend. I fell absolutely and completely head over heels for him - and we dated on and off for about a year. It was among the most intense experiences of my life. When it didn't work out I was beyond devastated - he ended it because he wanted to go travelling. And off he went without so much as a backwards glance. 

Long story short, in hindsight, I'm so very glad it didn't work out with this person. In hindsight he wasn't the nicest guy. He was very pushy when it came to sex. He was also very selfish in bed. He also wasn't the most intelligent - in fact he was a bit dim. He lacked the capacity to think about the feelings of others. ""Well that's a major red flag"", I hear you say. Yes indeed - you would be right - but I was too young, insecure and infatuated at the time to really notice.

I've since developed some boundaries and self respect.

He actually texted me a few months ago asking to meet up, saying he missed the times we used to have together. I said no thanks. Today I saw him on a dating app and swiped no. I'm never tolerating disrespect again.

Feeling very pleased about this little personal win. People will treat you how you let them - and I'm never giving him the time of day again."

Someone who just saw me a month ago made this comment underneath: “You lost a lot of weight 👏🏻👏🏻”

The funniest part (or tragic depending on one’s point of view) is that I’m not even anything like what i looked like in that photo. I had very long blonde hair then, now I have a pixie cut. My face obviously, and inevitably, changed a lot since my adolescent years. But this person who looked at that picture didn’t even bother to notice that the ‘woman’ she saw a month ago can’t possibly be that girl in that picture. Instead she directly looked at how my weight changed and decided to compliment me on that aspect which turned out to be an insult since it’s obviously the other way around. And of course this well-meant remark added to the list of body-shamings I’ve been subjected to since I gained a bunch of weight this past year.

The bottom line is that even when a compliment is the intended outcome it’s not a good idea to comment on people’s weight or any other physical features. Because you never know when you might unintentionally hurt feelings. Also it’s not our job to put a label to what others look like. It’s just presumptuous…"

i can't hang around my brothers friends as i dont like smoking weed. i don't want him to feel like his younger sister has to have her hand held and intrude in his friend group bc she's incapable of making friends of her own, he also doesn't want me along and i respect that.

i want to make friends so bad, in real life friends, but i have no idea how to. i adore the friends that i have, theyre always just 1 dm away and i can spend hours just calling w them and playing games so i don't mean to sound ungrateful i just.. wish i had someone to invite over i guess, no idea how to begin and as the years go by and my 20th birthday is only 4 months away i remember that i have noone to invite and that makes me sad"

I’ve always had a weird relationship with sex. I unfortunately grew up in the age of Kik and Omegle, and some of my first sexual experiences (particularly with myself or watching other people) started there. I used to show myself off on Omegle (yes, around 15 years old, or even before then, and it’s so fucked up now that i look back at it) and even learned how to masturbate from Omegle. I started to watch porn early on, and one of the biggest things i’m ashamed of is looking up beastiality videos. I don’t remember actually getting off to them, and for my mental sake I hope i didn’t, but it sickens me that I ever even considered looking that up. I feel like an awful human being. I struggle with OCD, and getting those thoughts out of my head seems impossible. I just wish I could erase those memories or redo my childhood and never have done those terrible things. I know that I was young and stupid and I never was that type of person and definitely am not now, but I can’t seem to move on from my past mistakes.

Her boyfriend / baby daddy and his friends have turned her into such an awful fucking human being. I’ve been considering just dropping them all together. I want to go and be a good friend and support her during the birth but they’re such shitty people. 

I had a boyfriend who they would constantly shit on him and make him feel like shit intentionally for their entertainment. 

They said he was the reason they stopped asking me to hang out bc when I was dating him I’d rather hang out with him and my other friends. Am I wrong tho? He hated hanging out with those friends because they were so mean to him and I’m too scared to stand up for myself and him. They said they were joking but tbh they treat everyone outside the friend group like shit. They just make fun of you and basically say shit like “kys don’t you wish you were dead why do you do xyz” and I used to think it was funny when I was like 17 whatever edgy humor but it’s really immature and horrible to treat people like that. 

Now they do it to me they make fun of me for dating my ex, they make fun of me for being willing to date anyone etc. now she ignores me for 5 days and finally messages me back saying her bf won’t stay with her while she’s having the baby so she wants me to be there now …….

Her and her bf and his friends, they said yea let’s hang out and I said ok when you guys are online playing games let me know and I’ll come join, they said ok, 5 days of them mbeing online and playing games they don’t ask me… however playing with other friend groups is much more enjoyable than being around people who’s only entertainment is shitting on people for fun. 

Am I in the wrong to ghost her and just not show up or should I bite the bullet and go and then ghost her? Like they’re such shitty people they just stress me the fuck out"

I harassed my mom into buying me 1000s of dollars worth of computer hardware. I was playing videos games all day long. I stopped attending school. I was an absolute brat. I used to eat out every day. I used to splurge on electronics.   


Somehow I graduated high school, got a shitty rank in the national engineering entrance exam.  My friend who was from an economically disadvantaged family said something along the lines of ""I could have gotten into an IIT if I had the same financial resources as you.""   


I did pick up a little bit of programming during that period. I went to a shitty college for undergraduate studies. Then I came to the US and got a master's degree.

Someone gave me a half gram of coke, so I decided to do it and clean my kitchen to get rid of the ants we've got for some fucking reason. I took everything out of the room and took my roommate's plants off the window sill so I could properly clean the window.

Well, my cat took that as permission to go up there and got stuck with the pull cord for the blinds around her torso while I was in the bathroom. By the time I got back, she was panicking and struggling to get out, so I grabbed her to try and help. 

One of the other cats seemed to decide that I was hurting her and attacked me, complete with cat screams. My cat got out of the strings and he tried to go at her as she ran past him, so I gave him a kick (this is *not* something I'd normally do, but I was legit being attacked - and it was *not* a hard kick). His brother was all puffy and didn't know what was going on and tried to get out of the room, so Meowth started screaming at and attacking *him*. I pushed him away with my foot, grabbed Jeff, and threw Jeff in my roommate's bedroom. 

Meowth went and hid somewhere and continued growling, so I gave him a few minutes and then put out a couple bowls with some wet food in them and scattered treats around to lure him out. It took a couple hours, but I finally convinced him everything was fine and I wasn't mad at him. He's now back to normal. 

I, on the other hand, am a fucking mess. 

My ass hurts where the main bite is.

The week before Christmas, I baked a bunch of stuff for my family and mailed them packages. My hands give me issues anyway, but after all the mixing and whatnot, my hands kept going all pins and needles and they hurt. 

Well, I woke up Christmas day to both hands in excruciating pain. Not only were they tingly, but they felt like someone was repeatedly stabbing my fingers. I paced around the apartment hissing in pain for about an hour till it let up. Now I'm concerned that I have a slipped disc or pinched nerve in my neck because both hands keep going pins and needles, and it's started going down my entire right arm.

To add to that, it feels like something is *definitely* wrong with my lumbar spine as I'm in more pain than usual and my pain meds are doing nothing whatsoever. 

Yesterday, my roommate decided we should run our dishwasher (we haven't in the six years we've lived here) and it drained under the sink and into the kitchen. Thankfully, I still hadn't been able to get things back in the kitchen, so it was relatively easy to clean up.

Even worse, my intestines are fucked up and making my back hurt worse. 

I'm on disability and don't have a vehicle, so getting to the doctor is difficult to begin with, but I'm trying to get them to order an MRI for both my cervical and lumbar spine. I get transportation through my insurance, but I have to schedule it three days ahead of time and sometimes they don't bother showing up. I've got appointments scheduled for 11 days in January already.

And my fucking mother is flying in next week and is supposed to be staying on my couch. I can't *wait* for her to complain about the cleanliness of my apartment!"

I (14 M) is a freshman in high school and like any other kid is going to have a crush on other people that they think suit them. I am not the smartest or the most athletic and I just do what I need to do to pass. Im just a normal high school freshman. 

Now I have a crush that’s in my Spanish (p.4) and English (p.1). She I GORGEOUS to me and whenever I’m in class she is all I can think about. She has nice long dark hair, nice bright brown eyes, and had a beautiful soft voice. 

I kinda expected this because of how damn beautiful she was but she has a boyfriend. Her boyfriend is also in Spanish class with me and my crush. Though they don’t sit next to each other they always text each other in class. And I can tell because I am the lucky one who got to sit next to her. 

And I’m not going to go out on her express how I feel and then go slander her boyfriend saying “THAT SHOULD BE ME IM WAY BETTER THAN HIM” because he’s really cool. He’s on the football team he’s funny and smart. 

I should probably state that I have extreme social anxiety and is a huge introvert so I don’t even talk to my crush at all. The most I’ve ever talked to her was when the class was glueing in notes in our notebook and I forgot my glue at home and asked her if I can borrow hers. 

The main problem that I am having is I can’t seem to get rid of my feelings that I have for her. I constantly beat myself up for it thinking “You need to stop liking her she has a boyfriend stop it.” Another thing is is that I also get a lustful feeling when I’m around her sometimes and I FUCKING HATE IT. I feel like I’m being such an ass whenever that happens. 

But that’s all I really have to say. It’s nothing special I just wanted to really type down what I’m feeling."

Then my mom on the other hand everytime I tell her I have no motivation to do anything I just feel stuck she always says she hopes I'm not pregnant.  She dont think I'm ready for kids but she always told me that everytime I go to talk to her she hopes I'm not pregnant.

&#x200B;

It is an issue with games, movies and series.  
I dont even really know how to describe it. I just cant get anything done.

I have so many games i wanna play, so many series i wanna watch ... that i just ... dont do anything at all. It doesnt make any sense. Like i can play games and watch Netflix for months with the things i wanna do, but i just cant. I cannot get anything done. I play the same 2-3 games for months now and i just cannot start anything new. I want to - but i cant. What the hell is wrong with me?

&#x200B;

There is so much choice - yet i decide to just do nothing. My best guess is, because i dont know where to start i just dont start at all. IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN SOMEHOW relate to this??

&#x200B;

How do i fix this crap? Of course - you think - uuhh just play a game? Just start one of the series?  
But i cant really get myself to do that.

I really have no clue what to do.

TL;DR: I have so much plans, that i just dont do anything at all."

We were all put in the same class each other each year and separated from the other kids most of the day and put in a corner to self-study more advanced topics. One of the students, who we will call Samir, emerged as my rival. We were both considered very talented, but he appeared to be a bit ahead of me. 

When the California state test scores came out every year, when I'd get a perfect score in math, he'd get a perfect score in both math and English and get a ceremony for it. He beat me in all the spelling bees, and there is even a picture of him and I holding honor roll certificates where he got ""Superintendent's honor roll"" and I only got ""principal's honor roll"". His close friends would rub in my face that he was smarter than me, and even began to bully me. 

Teachers would always talk about how great he was, and in fifth grade a reporter even came to our school to interview a fifth grader because ""Are you smarter than a 5th grader"" was super popular at the time. I remember the reporter walked into the classroom, the teacher said to choose me or Samir, and the reporter looked at me with disgust and motioned for Samir to come over.

In sixth grade, we were all being promoted to middle school and it was announced that Imran would be going to a school in a town a few miles north to have more academic opportunities. One of my friends from the gifted program had already gone to a magnet school across town and would later go to a hyper competitive high school in the hills west of our town. My other two friends in the gifted program also went to middle schools with more resources in other towns, leaving me to be the only one to attend the local junior high school. I went through a period of getting lower grades in junior high, but in high school I really kicked into gear, got into and went to Berkeley. I learned French and Mandarin to professional fluency as well, and later went to Johns Hopkins for grad school.

Everyone lost contact with Samir over the years, and the kids that bullied me with him apologized to me over the years and became good friends. Samir had no social media and nobody knew what happened to him. Out of nowhere earlier this year, he made a LinkedIn and viewed my profile. When I viewed his I found out that he had gone to UC San Diego after two years of CC and majored in one of the things I majored in and was now working as an office assistant in his sister's medical practice. I recognize that there is no shame in CC and that there are tons of reasons someone might go to one college over another, but it made me really happy that after all those years of bullying and being told Samir was smarter and more talented than me, I went to UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins and he went to UC San Diego."
rrfyit,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rrfyit/i_just_need_someone_else_to_hear_my_story_ive/,I just need someone else to hear my story. I’ve been holding this in for so long.,3,2,1640805043.0,"Hi, I’ve been thinking of a way to start telling this story for months and a way to justify my sharing it. Then I realized I don’t need a reason to share this story because it’s mine, and I’ve decided to take back my life. I was 15, #metoo.
   I met my rapist when I was 11 years old, at church. He was a friend of an older girl in the youth group that I really admired, so I immediately wanted to be his friend. Immediately upon him meeting the members of our church and youth group he was welcomed and loved. He was charming and charismatic, everyone liked him. 
  I was 12 when my father abandoned me. I was 12 when I was looking for anyone and everyone to just want me. I was 12 when I was at church and I was convinced that I didn’t need my father because God was there. I was 12 when an older boy saw someone he could begin to manipulate and groom into what he wanted. 
  All through out middle school if I was having a bad day or I needed support I could text an older boy and have him pay attention to me and support me. He told me I was beautiful, smart and important. He told me I didn’t need friends in school because I had friends at the church. He told me I had him. 
   I was 14 when I went on a mission trip with the church, and most importantly the older boy. He was 20. We spent a week together. We spent a week in front of other adults, leaders in a church, flirting, pretending to be “married”. I was 14 when I fell in love with the man who had been grooming been since I was 12. 
   I was 15 when members of my youth group helped set us up for an opportunity to be alone, and have our first “date”. I was 15 when I was alone in the woods with a 20 year old man alone laying in a hammock and he kissed me. I was 15 when a 20 year old told me he loved me and wanted me to be his girlfriend. I said yes, and no one did anything. I had successfully been manipulated into the relationship he had been grooming me into. We dated very publicly in a church and no one did anything. He was a member of the worship team. Everyone liked him. He was a “leader” in the church and youth group. 
   I was trying to find a nice way to say this but there isn’t one. I was 15 when a 20 year old man picked me up, took me to his college apartment and raped me while my mom was at work. He told me we were in love. He told me I couldn’t tell anyone, about what we had done because he could get in a lot of trouble and I loved him so I shouldn’t want anything to ever happen to him. He was 20 years old, he knew exactly what he was doing. I was 15, I wasn’t old enough to consent, even if I thought I was. He was 20 and he knew what he was doing was wrong. He was an adult, and I was a child.
   We dated on and off for almost 3 years, in a church, publicly, in front of kids my age that knew I was having sex with a legal adult. They didn’t say anything, I was convinced they were my friends. My youth pastor and pastor knew we were dating and they never said or did anything. He was charismatic and charming and he could do no wrong. 
   I was 18 when I began to realize that the man who had me under his spell for so many years was no longer someone I recognized. I was gaslighted constantly, made to feel dependent on him for everything. He told me multiple times if we broke up it would ruin our friend group within the church and that it would make things awkward. I tried to communicate what I needed out of a relationship and was told that I was selfish and needy. I was told we were in love and we were going to be together forever. I tried to break up with him once when I was 18 and was immediately shunned by the church and it’s members. I was made to feel unwelcome. It didn’t matter that I had been at the church since childhood. It didn’t matter that I loved Jesus. I was just the Ex-girlfriend who hurt him. I never felt welcomed back until I started dating him again to try and regain the only normal I had known since I was 14. All of my friends were in the church, I had nothing besides that and he knew it. 
  I was 18 when I cheated on him because I knew the only way I could keep my friends was by dating him. He spent so much time ignoring me he didn’t notice for months. When he found out I was called the meanest and nastiest things by him and members of the church, people I thought loved me. I was immediately the bad guy, no one wanted to hear my side because I was the cheater. I was kicked out of groupchats, and shunned during church events.
  For a long time I really believed I was the bad guy. I believed everything that happened was my fault. I believed that I hurt him and he had never done anything wrong to me. I lost everything because of him. I lost all of my friends, I lost my church, I lost my mentors, I lost years of my life living with severe depression brought on after this played out. 
   So here I am to say, yeah - I was the cheater, but he was my rapist. I was 15, it was rape and it took me 6 years to realize it. I was 15 and he was 20 and he knew what he was doing was illegal. I was 15 and no one in the church ever tried to help me. I was 15 when I was raped. 
   I’m 22 and my rapist will never be in jail. I’m 22 and my rapist just got married to the girl of his dreams. I’m 22 and I’m watching people I used to consider family celebrating my rapist. I’m 22 and when the occasional picture of him somehow shows up on any of my social media accounts I have a panic attack. I’m 22 and I’m still the crazy ex girlfriend that made up stories + cheated but he’s still leading worship at church. If the god they believed in was real in the first place, he never would’ve let that shit happen.
   All of this is to say - believe women always. I was 15, #metoo."

I think this was pushed back due to circumstances of the world but the state of Maine started the “ no plastic bags” thing on July 31st of this year. So to shop at a store, you need either your reusable bags or you pay 5 cents per crappy paper bag. 

So, here is what annoys the hell out of me. This is all about helping the environment? Okay cool, I’m 100% for that but why the fuck could supermarkets, Walmarts etc give out all those plastic bags FOR FREE!?!

I’m certainly not a scientist but my basic thought process is we are paying for bags that can probably decompose a hell  of a lot faster than these plastic bags. Then we are paying for the production and delivery of said paper bags but never did for plastic bags (unless I have always missed a surcharge but self checkout never asked me how many plastic bags I used)

So my gripe/ question and TDLR all in one; 
Why the fuck did we not have to pay for plastic bags that are more harmful to the environment but we gotta pay 5cents for a paper bag?"

I’m just so incredibly tired and beat down. I want it all to be over but too many people depend on me and would be heartbroken if I took the easy way out. 

My wife is completely disabled. It happened a few years ago, and there’s no hope for recovery. She needs me to do everything for her, and I do and I don’t mind that at all, I would do anything for her. But work makes it so hard. I could handle it if not for work. My job is incredibly demanding and unlike before when we both had good jobs now we’re just barely squeaking by and I’m seized with this constant terrifying anxiety that if anything happens to my horrible job that’s slowly killing me then the whole family is screwed. Her disability is next to nothing and her medical expenses are breaking us despite the outrageous amount I pay for health insurance. 

The kids and pets depend on me too, for everything. She can’t drive anymore so that means every errand is on me, but at the same time my job is blowing up my phone 24/7 demanding things. If I go get groceries or clean the house, I miss things at work and get screamed at. If I focus on work then the house falls apart. 

My elderly mother disowned me because she fell down the Q cult rabbit hole and they convinced her to cut ties with everyone who wasn’t a member. But I promised my dad on his deathbed I’d take care of her so despite the fact that she won’t speak to me or see me I still support her financially because I’d feel like I failed him if I didn’t, and a part of me hopes some day she wakes up and returns to being the mom I remember. I need her right now. I need somebody. 

I’m only 40 and I feel like I’m 100. Everything hurts but I can’t afford to go to the doctor and even if I could I don’t have time. Someone needs me for something every second of every day. 

I can’t kill myself, it’s too selfish. They all depend on me too much. But every single time I get behind the wheel of my car I pray someone runs a red light and just ends it all for me. Just about the only decent benefit my job provides is a lot of life insurance on me; at least if someone else was at fault for my death my family would have enough money to live on. And I’d finally get to rest and be left alone. No more pressure, no more responsibilities, no more disappointments or anxieties. Just quiet. I wish for it every day. I know that’s selfish, but I’m just so god damn tired. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this. It feels so pointless. I don’t know what I expect anyone to say about it. I’m just having a particularly rough day and there’s no one else I can tell."

So I’m sure someone has posted something like this before but wanted to share my thoughts. I recently downloaded Hinge. I was out with my two friends “Kate” and “Hannah” getting lunch after this last month me and my girlfriend broke up. It wasn’t a long relationship so it hurts but I think it was for the best. My two friends basically told me they’d make the account they’d help me meet someone else who is more on the same page with where they’re at in life. And I’ve used it a tad but I feel bad. I don’t know if anyone else has experienced this but when someone says something or likes something and I don’t want to match with them I just feel like a jerk. I get these are made to be simple like who you like and don’t like who you don’t. But I still feel like sometimes I’ll get liked by girls and my thought is while yes it’s easy to just like someone’s page they’re still putting themselves out there. To have a phone with no notifications or no matches hurts. And I don’t want to match just to match like those girls should be with someone who really is interested but I still feel bad. And I think the same is true for guys like yeah it’s easy for me to just like pictures but it’s hard when it seems like the people you like don’t match. Again not anything crazy but still kind of a bummer. Thought I’d share and I’d love to hear your experiences with dating apps.

At first I was very passionate about my work and was always looking to help/get more involved. I thought I wanted to work there forever. Over time I have burned out from exhaustion and my opinion of my job has changed - I feel the org is not managed very well, poor communication, unrealistic expectations, and overall that the employees are taken advantage of. I've lost my passion for it, and on top of some other things going on in my life, the last couple of months have been rough. I have tried to untangle my professional life and my personal life (previously all my friends were through work) and make myself less available for my own well being, but I think that has hurt my reputation of always being available and enthusiastic to help. (Which was unsustainable anyway.)

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm overreacting - my boss has not criticized my performance or asked for anything I can't provide. He knows I'm looking elsewhere and has overall been supportive and encouraged me to make connections and made a couple of introductions. But he just asked for a meeting out of nowhere about my role. And I don't want to tell anyone at work so as not to tip them off before I'm ready. But there are a few small things that make me think this isn't just a normal meeting or performance review. And I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I can tell I'm not using my best judgment right now because I've had poor sleep, had some family health issues, and other issues outside my control (and haven't been eating well). 

&#x200B;

I'm just worried because I have a degree in a really specific field that I no longer want to work in. I'm scared I can't find another job (or that it will take me a really long time to do so). I wanted a little bit more time. I also wanted the last word in a job that has gaslit, exploited, and underpaid me (but not in a way that would compromise my reference - just for my own self respect I wanted to quit rather than be fired. I almost quit after a really bad day a couple of weeks ago. 

&#x200B;

A friend told me that considering it took an entire year for my boss to fire an employee that was openly rude to almost everyone with multiple documented incidents, it's unlikely that I would be fired after a couple of lackluster months. Which I think is a good point. A competitor in our field is coming to our area pretty soon though, and I think he knows (and I know) that the org no longer has that kind of time to screw around with bad performance.

&#x200B;

Overall I don't regret the decision to pull back on my emotional investment in my job. I think it was the right thing to do. I just wish I had been paid appropriately and had more realistic expectations in the first place so maybe I wouldn't feel so bitter about all of this."

We are exactly alike in everything we do, but she is better at it, and we are always mistaken for twins but her looks far exceed mine. I am literally a failed version of her. But I love her. We are inseparable. I just wish I looked normal like her. I wish I was happy with my appearance and personality. I wish I was someone else.

They bought a house together before the housing market got out of control. They have a huge yard and a nice kitchen. They both have college educations and make decent money. They have an open relationship and she is seeing multiple guys and has multiple partnered friends in our friend group interested in her and has men at work willing to risk their closed marriage to have a fling with her. The husband is also dating people too. I really feel my friend is the head of their household because she directs the chores for her husband which he does, I would feel bossed around if I was in his situation, but the husband is happy for because then he doesn't have to think about what he needs to do... and he DOES IT!!!

I know she has difficulties in her life and home ownership is no pick-nick, but I've been single for YEARS and renting in a shitty apartment and finding and marrying a supportive partner and owning a home are my dreams. People don't really show interest in me. I've used dating apps and sites before and I've had really bad luck on them. I don't know what's wrong with me!!!! I always thought I was kind of attractive, but these last few years have really made me think I'm not!!! I'm afraid I'm going to be alone renting forever!!! She's told me I'm a supportive friend, but I'm jealous of my best friend and it fucking sucks to feel like this!!!"
