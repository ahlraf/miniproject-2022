And the worst part is that you are forced to participate, celebrate and be happy too. Why do I have to be the weird one if I dont celebrate because I'm not in the mood? What if I had a rough day? I will be like shit but everyone is happy and celebrating. And then people will say to you crap like 'Hey why the long face, today is a special day!' or 'dont be sad, you will ruin the mood' like oh yeah thank you I'm not sad anymore. Being forced to be happy is what annoys me the most. Just leave me alone. I'm the only one that thinks this way?
Now, I'm not saying that festivities shouldn't exist. This was just a little childish rant of mine. And sorry for my english."

Flash player wasn‚Äôt a big part of my childhood, but it provided me with great games like Warfare 1917, Warfare 1944, and the Crush the Castle games. These games provided me entertainment whenever I was on my mom‚Äôs computer. Warfare 1917 was fun, what with trying to defeat the Germans in their trenches and using such things like the British heavy tanks against the A7Vs when they popped up. Warfare 1944 was fun with the opening level being D-Day, and trying to counter the Germans‚Äô heavy tanks with bazookas and the M4 Sherman. The Crush the Castle games were fun due to the cleverness that was needed to bring down each different castle. With saying all this, it feels like a part of me is going away with Flash player ending today. That is all."

For me it's neither been here nor there. On one hand I lost my person, the only person I could expose the deepest parts of myself to. Via a text. A long winded hurtful text. It was a heartwrenching experience. On the other hand I stopped smoking after 6 years of not trying.  I just woke up one day and the smoke just couldn't find a place in my lungs anymore. Didnt taste right. Didn't feel right. That was when the world became clearer. After years of hazy vision, the flowers smiled brighter and the moon couldn't shine any beautiful(er). I am neither happy nor sad but what I am is one with reality which is  a gift I wouldn't trade for any other. Happy new year people."

I was installing new insulation around my front door when I heard my neighbor laboriously scraping the ice off their walkway.

‚ÄúShould‚Äôve done that yesterday when it was snow and not ice.‚Äù I thought to myself.

I looked out my door to the right to catch a glimpse of this genus at work, only to see empty space.

I look to my left and there I saw it: my *ninety -four year old* neighbor scraping ice off her walkway two tablespoons at a time.

I said, ‚ÄúAre you kidding me?‚Äù

That was when the little Captain America inside me gave me this look: . . . ü¶Ö üá∫üá∏ ü§® üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö 

‚ÄúAlright, goddamnit, I‚Äôll help her!‚Äù

So I went outside and finished her walkway and put salt down. Took me five minutes.

She said ‚ÄúGod bless you! God bless you!‚Äù

Yeah, yeah. I‚Äôm going back inside to be a cynical bastard again.

I had this math teacher that was an absolute jerk, the guy would call out people in class for unrelated stuff, call people dumb, shit like that.  He was tenured though so all the reports went nowhere.  




For 2 reasons this was extremely difficult for me.  Number one, I had just been home schooled for the last 4 years.  I had very little to no social interaction just because I'm not great at making friends.  So when an adult was calling me out for not paying attention when I was, it's was hard.  Number two, I have really bad anxiety in the first place.  So my interactions with him were always high stress and the poor anxiety ridden me didn't have a clue how to handle it 





It came to a head one day when the teacher asked me a question, I got it wrong, and he started laughing at me.  I can't quite remember what the whole reason was, but I stuck it out like a ""man"" and when I got home, I cried.  



Of course my mom finds out because that's just what she does, and she comes to talk to me.  We talked about the situation and how it made me feel and all that and at the end she said something along the lines of ""In life, you are going to come across people that are hurting.  Most of the time you won't know why, but these people just require a little extra grace.  I call them EGRs, extra grace required""



I don't know why, it's just one of those things that stuck with me.  It's hard to dictate what it means to me, essentially I take it as ""you have your problems, they have theirs.  Take a break from yours for difficult people (EGRs) and try to remember that other people have problems to."".  Of course, some people are just jerks.  But to be able to have the grace to walk away from a situation that is over your head instead of lashing out or getting emotional.... I think that's kind of important.  It's always helped me, now having been in customer service for 15 years.  



Thanks, Mom :)"

I know I don‚Äôt need to name them bc we are well aware. But since today is the last day of the year I wanted to reflect on the year personally and I just can‚Äôt believe how much happened, good or bad, despite the terrible events. 

First of all, my parents divorced last Christmas and living at home as an adult going through that was not the best. I had the be the one there for my mom who was having the hardest time with it. On top of learning how to have a relationship with each parent and not them both collectively. Throughout the year I learned and I am happy that they are both the happiest I‚Äôve seen them this year. 

In May, I finished the hardest schooling of my life. I finished Nursing School! Despite my clinicals being cancelled last minute in March bc there wasn‚Äôt enough PPE to let students go, my school worked so hard to meet the board of nursing‚Äôs demands through online schooling so we could graduate ON TIME! Not only that, but they managed a drive through graduation ceremony to celebrate the higher standards the program holds its students to compared to the rest of the school. It was the most anxiety ridden I have ever been, I had the most mental breakdowns in my life, and I‚Äôm still managing my body‚Äôs reactions to the stress of it all but ITS OVER! 

In August I passed my board exams and became a Registered Nurse after studying for a whole 4 months straight like it was my job because we were in lockdown all spring and most of summer.
In October I got a job at my dream hospital where I used to volunteer. 
In November I had a socially distanced wedding and managed to take a honeymoon in the mountains near me. 
As of today, I managed to get through orientation, a month of working on my own, and save enough to buy a house next year. 

All in all. I am EXTREMELY proud of what I accomplished this year. I couldn‚Äôt have done it alone at all but I am just in such awe that soooo much has happened because it doesn‚Äôt feel like the same year. It feels like I‚Äôve recapped the last 5 years. Idk if this makes 2020 a good year all together but personally it‚Äôs been a good year despite all the garbage that‚Äôs happened. 

Has anyone else had good things they want to reflect on for the year?"

It really opens up the dialogue if I don't quite know what to talk about, and sometimes I do this by myself if I'm having a day with just a lot of thoughts. My therapist is on vacation this week, so I'm gonna just post my GBI here:

Good: I finished my college semester with all A's, so I made the Dean's List for my fall semester! My GPA is now 3.75 and I only have one more class to go until  I get my Associate's. I've been doing school and work full time, so I'm really proud of myself. Also I can now do a wheel pose in yoga, and it was really empowering to be able to achieve a pose that I wouldn't even dream of attempting a month ago. It made me feel really empowered.

Bad: I'm worried about my job. They gave us a lot of days off and cut our hours back a bit, and since it's our busy season I'm grateful for the break but this isn't like our company to give us a lot of time off like this so I'm really worried that COVID is starting to hurt our business. Also one of our best coworkers is moving on to a new position soon. I'm really excited and happy and honestly proud of him, but he's a great worker and I'm actually gonna miss him. I've been at my job for five years and it's always bittersweet to watch the people you spend so much time with move on. I know it'll all be fine but those first weeks with out him are gonna be a bummer.

Interesting: I started reading The Fountainhead by Any Rand. I really like her philosophy and this is the 3rd book I've read by her. I haven't had the time or energy to read longer books, so I'm excited for the challenge and the interesting perspective this book is providing. 

Thank you for listening! I hope everyone has a great New Year and I truly hope 2021 isn't as grueling for you as this last year was. Take care üíú"

No one thinks its going to change. We know everything will be the same tomorrow. 

Last year we were hopeful at this time, excited for the new decade to begin. Looking forward to better ourselves or for a new start. And then the new year quickly descended into chaos and confusion.

But this time, we are prepared. We know what awaits us. It won't dissappear, but we know what it is. We have a chance to fix it. 

My outlook has completely changed. I understand why someone would say ""I can't wait for the year to be over"" because it was a crazy year we weren't prepared for. But now we are a bit more prepared so anything the new year throws at us, we might be a little more able to deal with it.

Below that, share your favourite moment of this year. Could be something mundane, or something really insignificant, or something huge. What was your favourite moment of this year? This year sucked for most, so let‚Äôs chat about its good sides :)

2020 was a fantastic day to see the kids and the boys choirs in the choir room for a while.

I‚Äôd never seen mountains before this summer, and the first time I saw the Rockys my heart stopped in my chest. I‚Äôd heard the whole ‚Äúpurple mountains majesty‚Äù lark since I was a little girl in grade school, and I colored them as such in drawings but I never imagined that‚Äôd they‚Äôd truly be purple. 

But when I tell you, the first time I saw those peaks towering in the horizon? As you get closer, and the purple stabs the bright blue sky? The grass so green it looks like you‚Äôre dreaming. I still remember pulling off to the side and getting out, and looking across the valley and the air just felt different. It was surreal. 

I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll die before I experience that again. I waited so long and now it feels like I‚Äôm never gonna have the chance. I‚Äôve never seen the ocean, never seen the sun disappear on the horizon. I‚Äôve never stood where the water meets the land. Like how crazy is that? That water might have touched the beaches of Japan or Australia or Ireland or the Ivory Coast I don‚Äôt know. 

Logically I know I‚Äôll have the chance but this whole thing has me up at night, constantly worried. 

I‚Äôve never even really seen the night sky. Maybe a dozen or so stars here and there. But never truly, the way you hear about it. 

I‚Äôm trying to be safe and responsible, so I won‚Äôt be traveling. I just very deeply am feeling something? I dunno if it‚Äôs fear or regret.

I'm Jewish so I've always had a ""meh"" approach to Christmas movies but I really love film in general so I figured it's high time I watched it since it's considered a classic.

We've been stuck inside and his sister has been staying with us with her 2 year old son. I love them and I'm happy to have them but our normal routine had been disrupted and we've had no alone time to speak of. So we planned a nice day alone together on friday-going to the zoo together for the day. His sister invites us to dinner that night and even though we were trying to have an us day we thought it would be fun. 

He tells me last night his sister said something about coming with us to the zoo and that he told her we both kinda wanted to have some alone time and he hopes she understood. 

This means a lot to me because, while I don't mind his sister coming at all, the alone time was the point of the zoo and I was really looking forward to it. It speaks volumes to me that he actually felt the same way and also respected my wishes without making me look like the bad guy to his sister. I've had experiences with an ex who would invite his loathsome best friend to everything and it really upset me, so everything about this made me feel so understood and appreciated. (Again, not that I didn't want his sister to be with us or any of that, I adore her. We just had planned it for the two of us and he not only respected that but shared the feeling)

My family and I moved to a remote island off the coast of Rhode Island only accessible by ferry. 

I‚Äôve never complimented another guy out of fear that someone would know I was gay. Any time I get the idea, I immediately picture myself getting attacked by someone who overhears, or is offended. But now that I moved, now that I can be myself, I‚Äôm gonna do it. 

There‚Äôs this guy who works on the ferry. We‚Äôve made small talk every time we run into each other. He wears these stark white boots that cut off right below the knees, and they hug his legs tight. He‚Äôs got a deep voice and a nice beard (from what I can see with his mask on). He‚Äôs around my age and he‚Äôs really cute.

It‚Äôs still a compliment and I still mean it, regardless as to whether or not that compliment goes anywhere beyond kind words. 

I just wanted to share this with someone. It may be casual for others, but for me, I‚Äôm proving to myself that I‚Äôm not going to allow myself to be scared anymore. Here‚Äôs to being fearless!

If I stay home I will feel some kind of guilt because I feel alone and I should work more on my social skills, if I go out, well, theres covid and being around too much people I don't know gives me anxiety.

This is just an example, this problem can go from dumb things like where do I want to eat, to important life decisions such as keep my job or go somewhere else.

So I have a question for you, how does your decision process work, do you have any advice? Or do you struggle with the same issue?"

I loved my job and I've been very sad to not be back yet or potentially never going back. I miss my colleagues and I miss my clients. 

One client always gifted me something for Christmas/the holidays. It was never expected and always sweet to receive it. Obviously, since I haven't worked since March, I haven't been in contact with any of my clients, etc. The thought of receiving anything didn't even occur to me. 

Today I received a package. I was confused cause I hadn't ordered anything. So, I opened it and inside there was a very pretty succulent, a field notes type book that said ""New beginnings"" on the cover and a very thoughtful note wishing me all the best in 2021. It was from my client. 

It wasn't even a redirected package(like sent to my company and then forwarded to me). It was sent directly too me. They must have reached out to my (ex?) company for my contact information so they could still send me my holiday gift. 

I cried like a baby all morning over a plant and a notebook. Im sure it wasn't much of an effort on their part. But they took a moment in this shitshow we are now living in to think of me and send me something. And it just wrecked me. It was so touching. 

And hopefully my ugly crying tears won't end up killing it."

It's easy to organise and be happy but hard to make someone happy for others.

I'm really happy for all my friends who are dating or in relationships, but it just gets really depressing sometimes. I want someone to be happy with too. I want someone I can be intimate with again. I see all these couples on the holidays taking pictures together, spending time with each other's families, and just being together, and I just really miss having that.

I haven't been successful with dating at all, in fact I've never even been on a date. I've had troubles with both online dating and talking to people in real life. And there's this aching thought that used to be in the back of my head that's become much more central now, and that's the question: ""what if I never find someone? What if I'm one of those people who just never finds anyone?"". 

I know for some people that's okay and I respect that, but it's just not a life for me. I see myself as a social creature, and as such is want some to spend my life with: the ups, the downs, the joys, the anti-joys? 

Someone I can see every morning and every night. Someone to travel the world with or just cuddle up with.

It's boring, toxic, a lot of people insulting, attacking and throwing dumb phrases. My theory is that Facebook motivates people to identify themselves. Profile picture, name, job, friends, so people defends their ideas because they see their worth in them.

And Reddit is almost anonymous. You choose when you share something about yourself. Your age, face, nationality, none of that matters, and it's not a problem to have an account with any personal information.

Earlier this morning, my grandma and I had a heart to heart conversation and she told me she can't imagine how she/we could have survived this year without me. It's really heartwarming knowing that they appreciate every hardwork and effort you're doing.. so I wish that this 2021 will be the year to get back on our feet.

So what's the best thing that happened to you this year?

Have a nice day everyone. Happy new year!"

I am patiently waiting for when I will pass out and my 3rd eye to grow in. Hopefully that 3rd eye will see in 20/20 so I don't have to wear glasses anymore. ü§û

I am experiencing an extreme swelling in my mid section, hair has been falling out and the color in what hair remains on my head and in my facial hair has started changing color. None of that has anything to do with the vaccine, I'm just fat, balding and my hair is turning gray.

But, none of this matters because, as I first said...I'm currently dead.

Of course I am just joking. My arm is a little sore like any vaccine and I am showing no other ill effects. My second shot is 28 days from today. I willingly volunteered to receive the vaccine. My hope and thought process is that if my family gets vaccinated, my wife may be able to get home to New Zealand to see her family. She's postponed her trip for almost a year so far. She would be able to go but would have to quarantine for the entire trip and not be able to see her father who is not I'm the best health. I hope NZ opens up unrestricted travel to vaccinated visitors."

Though I've kinda just went along with things since I wasn't sure of what I actually wanted. Anyways the story behind it is that one of my parents was gonna have a sibling though that person didn't make it past birth. So my birth name is sorta in honor of this person. Then the past 3 years happened. Got familiar with the lgbtq+ community. Came out the closet for one thing and proceeded to live like normal. Then my pronouns start to feel not quite right. After digging deeper and learning more about non binary I notice that it seems like there's a match. So with the help of a friend I pick a more neutral name. And while my use of this new name has been minimal so far I like it way more. Anyways after get the confidence I decided to step out the closet again. And apparently it's selfish for me to want to change my birth name. Just on a nickname basis. I wasn't expecting to have it legally changed- I wanted to cover this myself when I'm 18.

So am I selfish?"

kni4zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/kni4zz/why_do_people_feel_the_need_to_argue_in_an_angry/,"Why do people feel the need to argue in an angry and emotional kind of way, when a calm discussion on almost any subject would (most of the time) be more constructive?",14,51,1609386330.0,"Fair warning, the text is a bit longer than I originally intended to, TLDR at the end of paragraph

A bit of context for this question. I am generally a very introvert person, so I don't get easily excited for what most people get excited about. Even for the things I am passionate, I have a calm demeanor (for instance, I like sports but I rarely yell to cheer for my time, except when I am at the stadium or in cheering crowds, obviously before the pandemic). So in general I try to remain calm as a philosophy (Seneca and Epicurus were my philosophical point of reference since high school and I try to follow the same approach).

If I need to get angry I would, although I don't like it and it is a very rare event. I am asking this question as over and over in the last months I witnessed several people (family, friends, acquaintances) get excessively mad over really dumb things. Not with me necessarily (in fact, very rarely) but more in general with other people. I always thought these were overreactions, but it seems that if you get into an argument you are supposed to be yelling, insulting or cursing or whatever. I am seriously starting to wonder whether maybe then my approach is wrong, and I am writing here for a casual conversation regarding how you see it.

Mostly, I feel that several problems can be calmly discussed and solved, but I witnessed several situations where one of the party just loses before anything constructive can be achieved. Also, to get to a similar level of anger, even if worth it sometimes, really requires a level of mental energy that I fell could be put to better use. Of course, there are cases where people cannot reason and this is different. I feel this should be easy common sense, but apparently either there is a lack of common sense, or my approach could be sending the message that I don't care about stuff (which is not true). But again, this is a more general situation, not something I am directly involved with, it involves family and friends often arguing with other people.

Maybe in the US is different? I live in the US but I am from Italy. In my city, going to the university with the subway, on the way from the subway to school I often witnessed some light car crashes, because the roads are a mess. In that neighborhood every time that happened (3-4 times in 3-4 years) the person who could get hurt jumped off the car and more often than not just started directly beating the crap out of the other person while insulting him (always boys were involved in these situations). This is an extreme example, but wouldn't make it sense in almost all situations to resolve the situation with a more calm approach? Sorry for the wall of the text, looking forward to hearing your opinions.

**TL, DR**: Why people generally take an aggressive approach while arguing, even in situations where this is not the most effective way to resolve the issue? Is keeping a more calm approach to solving disputes an indicator of the fact that the person taking this approach does not care enough?"

Ever since entering my mid-20‚Äôs, I‚Äôve noticed so many changes in my body, and not for the better. And how my digestive system reacts to various foods has been one of those noticeable changes. I mean, if I were even 5 years younger, this food in my belly right now would‚Äôve been digested and done with already. But now it sits there in my stomach like a brick, slowly working its way through my GI tract. I‚Äôve also noticed that I can‚Äôt eat the way I used to. I mean, I was never a particularly unhealthy eater (actually, I had pretty good dietary habits), but even my reasonably healthy past eating habits don‚Äôt seem to sit well with my maturing body.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I go to a good university (one of the top 20 in US), where I major in a relatively difficult STEM subject. Cheating took place obviously when classes were in person.

I'd say I am one of the hardest working students I know, and I feel quite confident about the fact that I am a hard working student. (I should be more humble, but I really pride myself on the fact that I study very hard). I spend more hours than anyone I know preparing for the exam - I take notes diligently during class, I re-write and re-read those notes, I go to office hours, I review with friends, I find extra questions online or in libraries to make sure I get them, etc. And the thing is, I know I am quite capable because I also happen to be one of the go-to people when it comes to explaining difficult concepts. And most of the time, I am able to explain a concept or teach another student about the course material with relative ease.

But when I sit in the class room to take a test (and of course I'm friends with high-achieving friends), I always realize that I am either approaching the question in the wrong way (using a wrong formula) or I have made a mistake (math or otherwise) and etc because my eyes always somehow land on other peoples' exams. I then use the information and the knowledge I have and make sure I get those questions right. I wasn‚Äôt always like this, not in high school at least. 

I'd say without cheating, I would get around 80-90 percent on an exam quite easily. But with cheating, I get a grade in the A-/A range. 

I always work hard on projects and essays, and I always do great on them. I never cheat on those because I can just devote more time, read more, think more, go to professors and ask for help, etc‚Ä¶ But for some reason, I simply cannot stop myself from cheating when I have the chance to do so. If I‚Äôm even a slightly doubtful about a question, I immediately catch myself looking at other people‚Äôs answers to make sure I am on the right track.

I am writing this because I kept telling my friends/parents that I feel nervous because I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve the grade. I feel like the As that I get aren‚Äôt me. My friends tell me I have imposter syndrome, but I‚Äôm not so sure that it is imposter syndrome because I am kind of an imposter. But also, I work insanely hard, and I also to an extent deserve a good grade.

What do you think?"

This has bothered me since last year when I was at a wedding. I went to the bathroom at one point & was brushing my hair with my own hairbrush that I brought in my handbag when a relative (woman in 30s, same as me) walked in & saw me brushing my hair & started acting like I was washing my hair in the sink or having a shower. 

She acted like she was horrified but also amused saying things like ‚ÄúOmg this girl! What are you like!‚Äù & it went on & on for a long time embarrassing (& confusing) me in front of other people there. I was completely dumbfounded as to me brushing your hair in the bathroom is a totally normal thing to do? My hair gets a bit dishevelled through the day, maybe some people‚Äôs don‚Äôt & they can go all day without having to worry about their hair, but my hair needs a brush atleast once on a long day, especially when it‚Äôs an event I want to look nice at. We also have windy weather in the U.K. often do your hair can get messed up before you even get to an event. 

To me it‚Äôs just like touching up your powder/lipstick in the bathroom. I have never ever heard of or seen anyone react like this about brushing hair in a public bathroom before & it‚Äôs bothered & baffled me ever since.

The Shining is my favorite Steven King book, and I adored the movie.  So naturally I did some research into the King vs. Kubrick thing out of curiosity growing up... eventually learned to stop bringing it up at parties.  The fact that they used this for the second key absolutely blew my mind.

I had a Beetlejuice doll with a spinning head as a kid (freaked my friends out), he made a brief cameo, but you never see him in anything anymore.

The Holy Hand Grenade was a nod to Monty Python, and I think I could recite the entire Holy Grail movie in middle school.  Yes, I was one of those kids.

I made a woman (who I do not get along with) ha take my money to go bail M out of jail. The two exes helped me locate M once he was out.  We were at some old ladies house that had like at least 100 kittens.  I was doing her laundry and M walked into my old upstairs apartment next to old woman‚Äôs house, to knock out someone who hasn‚Äôt been around in over 10 years. then we hid in the old ladies house from the cops.  the old lady said the cops described M as a tall, gay, Hispanic . which made me laugh. but the old lady told the cops no homospanic was there. so I ran M and I a shower. he told me to ask the lady for cat nip cuz it helps dudes get boners (??). he told me I was the girl of his dreams. then I woke up. 
-for some reason i‚Äôm always looking for M In my dreams.  we were at some castle full of pennies. everything was old. The castle, the pennies, all had moss, grass, and spiders on them. once I found M, he asked me to come go through pennies with him, and to throw some with him too? woke up.

I had blood in my eyes, and couldn‚Äôt see anything, but was still trying to find M to make sure he was okay.

This post is just to maybe get some thoughts about what I could do to fix my situation as it is deteriorating my mental state day by day.

I am lonely. I have had a lot of trouble acknowledging this fact. Over the last few weeks as my country has gone back into lockdown, I feel my mental state declining day by day as I have little social contact. Of course this is understandable with the current situation in the world, but also my online connections have completely stopped in the last few months.

To clarify, I do have some social contacts. Some friends, my parents and some random people which I rarely play some games with online. One big thing is lacking in all of these contacts though, the possibility to actually express my feelings, emotions and what's on my mind with someone to the fullest.

It might not necessarily be the case that I am lonely, rather it might be the case I have no one that I hold really close to my heart. I have always thought that a relationship would be the magical fix to this problem, but it has turned out that that is not the case.

I really have no clue at this point how to improve my situation. It is hard to meet new people at this time and as my mental state is declining by the day, it has become harder and harder for me to connect with people online to maybe find an outlet that way.

I am starting to feel my loneliness is starting to turn into a form of depression as it becomes harder by the day to do stuff. I am less enthousiastic about things I used to be super passionate about. It is really hurting me, as I spend most of my days just staring at my desktop and my Discord friend list filled with a few people I have no interest talking to.

I don't really know what I want at this point. Maybe a way to find people who I can express my real feelings and emotions with. Just anything really."

I'll go to my boyfriend's house for New Years, he lives with his dad and dad's girlfriend, but they lead very independent lives. They often eat at different times and just do their own thing...let's say there's not a strong ""family vibe"".

Me and bf had a whole plan, we decided what we wanted to cook for dinner and I was really excited because it was something that both of us wanted to try to make for a long time and I like to cook with him. The plan was eating and then go to his room and stay there, drinking and playing board games. But his dad and dad's gf insisted that we need to eat together and they want to cook something that I don't like that much (and they know I don't) and that they cook like almost every Saturday, so it's not something special or new. 

Maybe I'm just being petty, I know it's their house and it's logical to ask for us to join them, but it's very unlike them since we almost never eat together. And I really was looking forward the dinner me and bf wanted to make :(

It's not that much of  problem in the end, just needed to get my disappointment out! I should already be grateful that I can visit my bf actually."

It‚Äôs that time of year again where I start to feel ridiculously productive and want to improve my life in various ways. The problem is that I have SO many things I want to do. 

1. I want to exercise and get fit
2. I want to clean and organize the entire house and throw out all of our unnecessary things
3. I want to broaden my wardrobe
4. I want to keep my skin clear 
5. I want to repair my hair and find ways to make it look effortlessly beautiful
6. I want to decorate our home with a cohesive theme
7. I want to keep up with self care habits like doing my nails and eating healthy

I‚Äôm at a loss for where to start and I go through this same thing multiple times a year. I‚Äôm overwhelmed with what I want to do and disappointed that I can‚Äôt afford to do all of these things immediately. And then I lose motivation/steam and end up not doing any of it properly. Even if I can afford it, I still lose motivation more often than not because there‚Äôs so much I want to do. 

I don‚Äôt want to spend another period like this upset that I can‚Äôt do what I want and not do any of these things. I want to build up habits and feel proud and right now, I definitely have the motivation so I‚Äôd like to keep that going! 

I have this image of this person I want to be and this life I want to live but I can never do just that because it requires a ton of time or money. Does anyone else struggle with this? And does anyone have any advice on habit forming or getting through times where you can‚Äôt quite afford what you want or lose motivation?"

Sounds a bit silly I suppose but lately, it has been absurdly difficult to sneak peek on different businesses without having to sign up for a Facebook account. 

Then I did. 

And I got scared.

Holy Mackerel. 

I deleted my Facebook 2 years ago since April because my mental health was at the bottom of the undiscovered ocean level. It was just that bad. THAT bad. So I had to do something to make me feel better which was to delete Facebook. Since then, I have definitely become better and started to appreciate more things in life. Less screen consumption and more fun with my small family. 

Anyway, it was also easier back then to just sneak peek businesses without having a Facebook account to see  if they have good reviews or not. But that doesn't work anymore. Hmmm.

So I signed up again, got bombarded by many unknown 'you may know people', ads, weird posts, etc. It became too much so I deleted it again. It is scheduled for permanent deletion on the 28th of January.

Until then, I will steer clear of its path.

And on that planet there is animal (which I‚Äôll name as X) that looks like a pig, in fact X look almost similar to what pigs look like on Earth. But it‚Äôs a new creature that humans have I never seen. 

My question is: 

In a lot of religions they‚Äôre not allow to eat pork. But are they allow to eat that new animal that was found on a different planet ? 

Remember X is not a pig, but carries those similar traits of a pig. 

I had this conversation with a friend. I say yes those people are allowed to eat X since its not pork. My thought process is that pork is an Earth product and the Bible makes no mention of not eating animals from different worlds."

However one thing that I noticed. The dresses all had big pockets! Like you could put a shear in them kind of big. And some had pocket watch pockets. I absolutely fell in love with this idea.

I am a massive fan of pocket watches. It's a pretty sure fire way to get me hopping with excitement to show me a collection of the stuff. But my biggest frustration: dresses don't have pockets let alone pocket watch pockets. I really wish the trend of pockets on femme clothing would make a resurgence again.

I currently work a restaurant - half the time I bartend, and half the time I am the alcohol manager (meaning I buy all the alcohol for the place and run events, etc). It's a perfectly fun job, I like my bosses and coworkers, and it's a great job while I'm still young and in school. But I think I have a ""dream job."" 

I'm in undergrad for English with concentrations in linguistics and writing. When people ask what I want to do with my degree, I say I'd like to teach ESL (English as a second language) either in the states or abroad. See I've gone abroad before and I LOVE it. I'm very much a traveler and I love learning new cultures, meeting new people, working in new environments, etc. But I can't tell if I really do want to teach, or if I just romanticize the traveling and/or ""helping people"" aspect of the job. 

I also have a pretty long relationship going with someone who, frankly, I could see myself marrying. We live together, he is genuinely amazing, treats me like a queen and is lots of fun. But he is not really a traveler. I'm torn between my love for adventure/language and my desire to stay with him and stay near friends and have a family. 

I obviously have some time to think about it while the world is still in lockdown, but I feel like every time I think about my future, even vaguely, my mind just runs in circles. Like I can't figure out a single thing that I want, one way or another. I want to just let things play out and see where it takes me, but I also want to be bold and take control of my life, and I am just constantly torn between everything. Has anyone ever experienced this? Is there anyone with some wisdom to share on this subject? (I apologize for how poorly this is written - I know it's a little all over the place.)"

This year I saw a number of videos of kids being surprised by their new PS5 or Xbox X.  I was lucky enough to have had a Sega Genesis Xmas and a Playstation 1 Xmas, both on release years.  At the time those were not ""cheap"" consoles and with inflation they are on par with the $500-600 price tag on today's next gen consoles.

Seeing the videos online made me happy for the children getting the gifts, but it also made me sad for the kids who didn't get the new console for Christmas.

There were lean years during my childhood, and my parents made the best of it.  But I never had to wake up on Christmas day, or the day after, and see on social media all the other kids who got the gifts I didn't.  And I was privileged enough.   How tough it must be for kids growing up in less financially stable homes who have to spend their holiday break watching Snaps, tictoks, Instas, tweets, and Facebook posts from their classmates playing with the toys they didn't get.  

Add the pandemic to this equation and it made me as thankful for my family, my lot in life, and my access to technology before the days of social media, as it made me sad for the families that aren't as lucky as my own and for the young people who have their inequality thrust in their faces on social media these days.   It has happened since gift giving became a thing, but only over the last decade has social media made it an issue glaring in the faces of modern kids every time they look at the phone (something plenty of kids out there don't have either).

Imagining seeing a friend or two on Instagram playing thru Cyberpunk 2077 while I sit a home without, and I can't even go over to their homes to play with them, due to Covid, makes me kinda sad.

It ended up being appendicitis. I got my appendix removed and was sent home before Christmas Eve, and was able to spend the time with my family at home. But not before receiving x-rays and and a CT scan. 

Today my during a follow up call with my doctor, he asked the question ""so how did you break your break you back""?. I was a little dumb struck. 

Apperently, at his best guess, over 10 years ago I broke the ""tabs"" for lack of better words, off 3 of my lower 5 vertebrae  on the left side. It has caused no pain, and there is nothing recommend I do. They're simply free floating in my muscle tissue, and the bones are 100 percent healed. 

My best guess is a snowboard accident about 13 years ago caused it, where I ate it hard. I dropped maybe 20 feet onto the ice right onto my back. My best friend who I was riding with that day, is still my closest friend now. I called and talked to him. His recollection is that I barely crawled off the ice, went to the truck and preceded to drink beer to numb the pain (I was 22 at the time). Then partied that night, and rode all day the next day. I remember hurting and waiting in the truck, but I didn't think it was ""broken back worthy"". 

I will be seeing my doc for a 2 week follow up from the surgery, and I'll get to actually see the x-rays then. I'm rather excited to see them."

I had heard about reddit for a very long time before deciding to explore it.  I was bored and looking for entertainment that was low key.  

I did not create a user until I found r/snackexchange.  Then it was all I could think about!  Baseline hypnotic draw.  I had to create enough points to be able to participate in an amazing snack exchange with someone.  I HAD TO! 

I spent so much time exploring subs for spaces that I wanted to passionately comment or post, to contribute in an authentic way but still quickly earn what I needed for a SNACK EXCHANGE.  And boy, I sure did it, I did it, friends. (I think it was 600) 

Ha, what a dork.  I became so genuinely enthused about so many other subs, that I no longer cared about completing a snack exchange.  Of course, I found reddit secret santa and that totally took my heart and is one of the most joyful of reddit experiences with which to engage.  

But the snack exchange became an echo of a dream. Secretly, I kinda hope that I do complete a snack exchange, at some point in the future.  I am just grateful that it got me here."

Well, normally I keep two, one for rinsing my mouth and one to fill with salt water if I have a sore throat or something. 

Just before Christmas (or maybe the 24th, I don‚Äôt remember the exact date) my (what I call) toothpaste cup was gone. But since my mom was doing some cleaning and it was getting a little nasty looking, I figured she took it to clean it. So since it was late and I wasn‚Äôt bothered enough to go downstairs and get a new cup, I just rinsed out my salt water cup and used that. I forgot about it until tonight really. 

So it‚Äôs about 11:30pm (now 12am) and I go to brush my teeth before bed like a responsible person who doesn‚Äôt want their teeth to fall out. I open my cupboard and alas- my cup isn‚Äôt there again! And, to add to the oddness- most stuff I had in there (including a large quantity of pads) are also gone. Immediate panic. It‚Äôs too late at night to ask my mom, but I‚Äôm finding comfort in the fact that she was cleaning today and I probably just forgot where she told me she moved all this stuff. But I‚Äôm extremely freaked out and for some reason, my immediate thought was that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs someone living in our house in the walls!‚Äù But our walls aren‚Äôt thick and out house isn‚Äôt huge. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do if my mom has no clue where all the stuff has gone. I was convinced that a ghost was gonna suddenly appear behind me in the mirror or something. 

Another possibility is that my parents think it‚Äôll be a funny joke to drive me insane (which would be cruel because I have memory problems) but that‚Äôs unlikely. Oh well, gonna have to wait until tomorrow to solve the mystery. Any comforting words before I go to sleep?"

A few years ago, I started to get into meditation, as I was desperate to find something that would help me deal with stress. I tried out some videos you can find on YouTube about guided meditations and it kind of worked, but it wasn‚Äôt anything special.

One night, however, I was having trouble sleeping, so I decided to try to stay awake for the longest time I could with my eyes closed, like trying to meditate and just focus on my closed eyelids and the darkness you can see.

That night, something interesting happened. I managed to keep my eyes shut for a long time (can‚Äôt tell exactly how long, but probably between 30 minutes and an hour). At some point, the dark color you normally see when your eyes are closed started turning into a kind of purple, which has a personal meaning to me, and random spot patterns of this color formed in my sight.

The next day I did some research on what could have been that I experienced, and the only satisfying explanation I could find was about these microorganisms that live in our eyes that are photosensitive and that are responsible for the ‚Äúcolors‚Äù we sometimes see when closing our eyes. That was a good enough explanation for me, so I dismissed it as something not so extraordinary.

Despite that, I continued with this habit for a while, realizing that most of my dreams became more lucid whenever I did this. I had the fantasy that through this I could achieve something mystical, but never got any results beyond lucid dreaming. I eventually dropped meditation and kind of forgot about it.

Earlier this year, I got a present that will become important later. It was a plushie and it came to me in a moment where I really needed the comfort of company, so it quickly became something special and dear to me. I treat this plushie as if it were conscious and try to make it feel comfortable (nothing special, just taking proper care of it), and while I know it‚Äôs no more than just a plushie that helps me cope with certain aspects of my life, I still feel the desire to play along.

Anyways, the interesting part took place just two days ago, when I was again having trouble sleeping and without really thinking too much about it, I closed my eyes and tried to stay awake for as long as I could (out of boredom I guess). Once again, I eventually reached the point where I would start seeing purple, which didn‚Äôt surprised me as it was something I was expecting to occur. 

However, this time something odd happened. Some time after I started seeing the purple spots, I started hearing some tapping on my bed‚Äôs headboard (it is made out of wood, so it was very clear to me that the sound originated from there). The tapping had a very peculiar rhythm, reminiscent of droplets of water falling.

Now, at that point, I start feeling a bit scared, but at the same time excited, as it seemed as if I had achieved something by ‚Äúmeditating‚Äù. I wanted to keep my eyes closed to see what would happen, but the thrill from the tapping was too much and I finally opened my eyes. The sound stopped, and when I turned my head to look at the headboard, the ONLY odd thing I noticed was a small dent and that just a little bit of the paint was peeled off. I don‚Äôt really pay attention to the state of my headboard, so I didn‚Äôt think too much about it and tried going for a round two.

This time it was more difficult trying to stay awake, as I was getting tired and getting into that state of mind where you start dreaming without really falling completely asleep. Suddenly, the tapping returns, and I regain consciousness without opening my eyes, and something wonderful happened: my vision went from black to something that is hard to accurately describe, but it was like a blurry and foggy vision of a gray resembling color. A moving silhouette started forming and it was similar to a fictional character I know and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel euphoric. This vision started fading until it was back to the usual dark color.

The tapping doesn‚Äôt stop, so I decide to open my eyes and turn around almost immediately, but of course there was nothing there and the sound couldn‚Äôt be heard anymore. It was late and I was getting tired so at this point I decide it is best to try to actually sleep.

The next day I kept thinking about what had happened and the only reasonable explanation that I could come up with was that I somehow managed to induce myself into an auditory hallucination. You see, I have no cats or any other pet that could be responsible for a tapping sound on the HEADBOARD of my bead, so it‚Äôs pretty safe to assume it was not an animal. Also, the sound seemed to stop whenever I opened my eyes, so whatever was causing the sound seemed to be related to my sight. And I should also mention there are no clocks on my room, or my house for that matter, so again, the rhythm is something that needed to be explained as well.

I‚Äôm not someone who relies on the metaphysical, I usually try to think logically and find a reasonable explanation before jumping into crazy conclusions, and that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm telling this here, to try to reach a satisfying conclusion. But this experience is the closest (even though almost insignificant) I had ever gotten to a mystical experience. One of my biggest fantasies is to be able to travel to different realities and to experience the worlds of fiction I know on a whole knew level. Of course that‚Äôs impossible, but what happened that night showed me that it might not be completely true, so of course I had to try the same thing the following night.

And so I did, same procedure as always. I wasn‚Äôt waiting for anything specific, just any sort of sign that what I had experienced could be somehow consistent and therefore, not a complete illusion. I started seeing the purple spots as usual, and to my pleasant surprise, the tapping eventually returned. I was having some trouble this time, as I was more tired than what I was the previous night, so I just opened my eyes, and the only unusual thing I noticed at that moment was that the tapping stopped. 

I closed my eyes again and without realizing it I started falling asleep, but I was once again awaken by the noise and this time I could see amongst the usual color of my eyelids tiny dark spots that seem to be moving rapidly against me, as if I were traveling at a high speed towards them. As part of my fantasy narrative, I imagined this were the many realities I could travel to, but nothing I tried to imagined seem to work.

I gave up and opened my eyes and saw something odd. Remember the plushie I mentioned earlier? Well, my bed has enough space for two people to sleep on it, so
I always sleep with the plushie by my side, facing towards the ceiling. The odd thing I noticed when I opened my eyes was that I apparently had moved my bed sheet in such a way that the plushie was facing me (not impossible, but still odd). This was enough to disturb me and I decided that maybe I should sleep already.

I wouldn‚Äôt be telling this if it weren‚Äôt for what comes next. In the morning after taking a look at my headboard I noticed something that tells me what I had been experiencing is more than just a coincidence. Remember how the first night I noticed a dent and missing paint? Well, now a lot more of the headboard paint seemed to have been scratched, not enough for it to seem ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù, but enough for it to be way too noticeable, and I‚Äôm almost a 100% sure that it was not like that before that night. I even took a photo of it which I‚Äôm willing to share if anyone‚Äôs interested.

This was last night, and of course I‚Äôm going to try again this one, but I really needed to get this off my chest somewhere, and even then I‚Äôm afraid that by sharing this I‚Äôm in a way ‚Äúbreaking the magic‚Äù of it, making it no longer possible to replicate. Either way, if something interesting happens I will update this post if I see people are interested.

Any thoughts?"

Every game console I've ever gotten, I had to buy myself. My parents would never buy me one. Not for birthday, not for Christmas, anything. They would get me other things of course, other toys, bikes, ect. But I never got to have that super exciting Christmas day surprise of a game console. 

Like I said, it's a dumb thing to be upset about. But growing up, we weren't poor, we didn't ever have to go without something because of money troubles. We were middle class. I know my parents could have afforded it. Many of my friends who were less wealthy got them all the time. My dad always had a computer, and we always had good internet. I had to go to friends houses to play n64. My good friend had a PS2 and we played Tony Hawk all the time. But I never had them for myself. 

My first new console I bought, by myself, was a gamecube. It had been out for a bit already, and it came with an extra controller and metroid for about $100. I eventually bought a PS2 used off eBay so I could play guitar hero. My cousin had one and it was so cool and I wanted it so bad. 

I had friends with gameboys and I would always try and watch them play on their tiny screen. They would bring them to group gatherings. On boy scout trips, but I didn't have one. At one time, there was a special edition green Gameboy advanced SP with DK country at target. My dad bought 5-10 of them, to sell online. I had to buy my own, and I got a regular silver one at best buy, because I could get a warranty on it if I dropped it and broke it.

 I never had pokemon games when I was younger. When the DS came out, I didn't get one untill there was the DS lite, and I bought it together with my brother to share. We got our first pokemon game, Diamond, and I loved it. I eventually bought my own DS to play by myself a year or so later. 

All my friends were super into Halo (as most kids were) but we never got an Xbox. I usually just watched people play because I didn't have it, so was never good at it. My first xbox was a 360, without the wifi ability, that I bought used to play Skyrim. At this point I had already moved out of the house. 

Since then I've bought a used PS3, which I used until the audio started glitching. An xbox one s, a switch, and a few 3DS. 

I've always been into games, but only casually, as I never got the newest games or systems to play with other people, so I've mostly stuck to single player, or just casually played other ones. 

It's a dumb thing to be upset about. And it's not like I can't afford a new system. I could go buy one and several games right now if I wanted to. I'm not begging for one, and I'm not trying to get one. I've just always been a bit bothered when I see all these people that are surprised with a new console. The spoiled kids. The poor kids. The good kids. The bad kids. All of them always got what they wanted. And my family, even though I know they could have, never did. 

It's not like I'm ungrateful for the things my family DID get me. They have definitely gotten me some great things before, and they were always good parents. 

Anyway, that's the end of my little rant."

So, my dad has an addiction to orange Fanta, he drinks several cans every single day. He doesn't like the Fanta to be diluted, but he likes it very cold, so he freezes glasses with Fanta to use them as the ice, so when they melt he doesn't have water mixed with the Fanta, if that makes sense. 

Tonight we ran out of Fanta, usually when we run out of Fanta he gets very angry and anxious, but this time he seemed pretty calmed. I've been gone from home for the last 3 months so I figured he just didn't drink as much Fanta anymore.

After dinner, I entered the kitchen because of a disgusting smell, thinking that my sister had left the bins opened. What I found was much different. My dad was standing next to the microwave waiting for one of his frozen Fantas to melt, so he could drink it. I cannot even describe how gross the smell of microwaved Fanta is. When I asked him if he was really gonna drink that or if he was just trying to see if it worked, he confessed that he had done it a lot of times, not because it tasted good, but because he REALLY NEEDED to have some Fanta. Because I'm not at home anymore he can't buy cans as often, so he does this on a weekly basis. I really shouldn't have left."

Edit: Offering a little more detail. He was on 15L of O2 for the first week, with blood oxygen saturation levels between 75% and 85%. Currently, when resting, he is in the low to mid 90s. When he gets up go to the bathroom it dips to about 80%. He is at 4L of home oxygen.

And thank you for the silver, kind internet stranger. Also, the wholesome, other kind internet stranger!... I did not expect this kind of response. Thank you all times 1000!

Edit 2: and the hugz and other silver and all the positive, supportive comments. What a wonderful community! Not to get all sappy, but I am sincerely grateful for all the kind words. And for all the people going through this, too, I'll be keeping you close in my heart. Community is a powerful weapon against isolation and sadness. I'll probably share this with my dad tomorrow even though I don't think he really understands Reddit.

Last edit: I've seen several comments about people being frustrated with other people for only advocating for things like staying in, social distancing, and wearing masks *after* we've been effected (if you think that's me, I ask that you do some scrolling and read some of my comments). I understand that frustration. Yes, you've been advocating for these protective measures all along, if everyone approached this the way you've been this entire time, we wouldn't be where we are today. But I would argue that people whose views have shifted are going to be just as, if not more, effective in convincing those that remain to be convinced that this is a dangerous thing that needs to be taken more seriously. Some people are mad at me, fine, be mad (also... read my comments). But maybe consider that just because some people's journey and arrival at the truth isn't your ideal, doesn't mean that they can't be fellow harbingers of that truth. Did people get mad at Christopher Reeve for only raising money for spinal cord injury research *after* he was paralyzed? I realize the potential for contracting this virus is far greater than everyone in the world becoming a paraplegic, but hopefully the purpose of my metaphor isn't lost.

Ok, I lied... maybe this is the last edit: Thank you everyone for you well wishes, I'm sending you all some, too. I've tried to keep up with all the comments, and if I missed you, I'm sorry! If you scroll down and read more of the threads, you'll find that I've made a lot of mistakes. Some of which I'm still finding out about. You might find things that make you think less of me, and that's ok. My main objective in posting this last night was to hopefully reach people like me, who also need to change. Yes, it sucks that it's taken this long, and I feel like a fool; but I'd rather be thought of as a fool and take this seriously now, than go on with the mindset I had before."

I am asking because I would like to build a platform where people would engage with it because it ll be an informative app and more of a suggestion box like what restaurants to dine or what movies to watch and also will have an informative section such as interesting facts or news that are actually true. Would love your advice if you would actually use an app of that sort? Any comments will be highly appreciated. 

Instead of seeing people you know or getting views, you‚Äôll be on it to see what‚Äôs new or what‚Äôs happening and something interesting to read somewhat like Reddit but in the form of TikTok like the ai will provide you with content you‚Äôd like from people or businesses such as media companies?"

My parents immigrated here and worked hard to get where they are.

Very very torn between these two belief systems:

1. The world doesn't hand anything to you on a silver platter. You have to work for things. In my instance, I have tons of privilege and access to resources, and should utilize these things to learn and excel beyond what I am doing now, aiming for constant growth
   1. Example Sentiment: I should excel and push myself to go above an beyond at work, even though it feels straining and not all that fun sometimes. This way I can continue to climb and achieve and build a name for myself.
   2. Example Sentiment: Work should be something you focus a lot of your life on, and something you are passionate about
2. I didn't choose to be born. I have already solved the issues I need to solve--I have money to pay for things, I contribute to society, and I am healthy. Why should I strive and suffer for achievements? Why not continue the chill and just smoke weed everyday?
   1. Example Sentiment: I will do only what is required at work, no more no less. Work involves a transaction where I deliver services and time for money, and nothing more.
   2. Example Sentiment: Work is a means to an end

I feel like the answer might be a mix of the two...

The ones that I used to call friends, now are meeting without me at my back, and that makes me feel so deceived. I think people are getting bored of me, I am a good person, I don't like much the social media, so I don't use it, and I love learning in the school, drawing, writing and listening to english/american music, not the popular one in my country. I don't ever hang out with friends before an exam or during the week, and that seems pretty normal. I prefer having one real friend than a lot of false ones. I can't even go out alone yet.

I basically feel so strange, and I've been hurt by people that I trusted. Things are changing so fast, I'm trying to find real friends, but that seems imposible. I'm not like the other ""teenagers"", and that is leaving me alone. I guess this is pretty normal but I just wanted to tell someone, I feel a little down today. 

Sorry if there's something wrong written or with flaws, english isn't my first language and I sometimes can't express myself well. Thank you for reading, I appreciate any advice."
kmg8v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/kmg8v5/one_of_those_awkward_days/,One of those awkward days,1,0,1609255003.0,"I joined a new company remotely two weeks ago and today was my first day in the actual office (opened on rotation). Anyway, things started with an online team meeting and I was on mute when it came to introductions, then I accidentally left the call (lol) instead of muting myself after. Made a comment that was just me trying to be funny but yeah, I think I left an overall very awkward impression. 

I wasn't asked to join the rest of people at my level (for example, assistant managers) when they went out for lunch, although this might just be because I was set up in an entirely different wing of the office with my boss. After, things just kept being awkward and now I have a stress headache and my anxiety is making me rethink every single thing I said and did/didn't do. 

If you've joined a new team remotely, how has the experience been for you? What does WFH mean for team building? And how do people with social anxiety cope? Do you ever have one of those days where you feel like you've lost all ability to 'people'?"

I've found that a lot of elderly members of the family like telling stories about their youth but have to be prompted to do so because they'd rather ask how you are. I'm trying to help people capture their family stories as much as possible so i've tried creating some resources, but i'd like to know from the r/CasualConversation community, what would make it easier for you?

I've created an android app to create profiles for your family members in a bit of a family tree, then record the mini interviews with them or upload any recordings you already have. It's called [ParleSound](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parlesound) and it's free without ads, unless you find it really helpful and want to upgrade beyond a few family members profiles.

I've also created Question Packs to help give you prompts of what you could ask, there's 2 i've made so far (one around a standard set of questions about their youth etc, and the other around their experiences of 2020) - [they're here](http://parlesound.com/packs).

What else could help you start capturing those stories with your grandparents or parents?"
kmfqdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/kmfqdf/i_havent_earned_a_single_human_relationship_in_my/,I haven't earned a single human relationship in my life. And that is kinda depressing.,12,6,1609253194.0,"My mom stays with me and I pay for her rent and expenses. I was having a random conversation with her about what would happen if I became sick with an expensive illness/accident. She has a house that is rented out to pay for loans my dad took. I told her she should just sell the house  which is in her name and she can afford treating me. She told me that she wouldnt do it because if you sell the house in an emergency then the value of the property goes down!

For context, I work in one of the highest paid professions in my country with pretty difficult exams for entering. I am currently trying to have my own practice/exploring options instead of working in my profession full time. I told her it makes 100% economic sense to sell the house and get me treatment at the best hospital in the country since I can easily repay the expenses by working a full time career.

I asked her what would she do if I die, what would she do with the house then. She said she can sell it at a good price and pay for her basic living expenses since she is 55.

I dont have medical insurance since I am not really sure how it works because there is no guarantee that all diseases/operations will be covered. I always thought that if I do fall sick with a rare, expensive condition my mom can sell the house and pay for the expenses, so insurance doesnt make sense and is just a waste of money.

I guess I was wrong, I was surprised I had to argue with her to convince her.


I dont have any real friends even though I feel I am pretty fun to be around, because I dont really hang out too much and I prefer to spend my free time playing games. I mean we hang out, but I dont really know how much we would do for each other.

I am 27, and this feels really sad that I dont have a single human relationship that I have earned in my life."

I started working out and eating a lot and around August I felt like I was stuck at around 53 kg, I couldn‚Äôt go any higher and nor did I go any lower for like a month. Turns out diet was really an important thing, like in biology class I learned that it took a lot of carbohydrates to turn into fat and aminoacids, so my first logical leap was that if I took in more fat, I would gain weight faster, which I quickly realised was wrong like it did no difference at all. Then I decided to bump up the carbohydrates and eat more meals per day and it did help me gain at least a couple of kilograms. I decided to weigh myself less, it did bum me a little bit that I gained weight so slowly. I looked today and what do I see, I‚Äôm just at the line of underweight to normal weight in the BMI.

kmdwyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/kmdwyp/i_feel_incredibly_supported/,I feel incredibly supported,1,0,1609246616.0,"  My family is very cold, rigid, and outdated. They are quite close-minded towards the thought of anything other than what they view as best. We're one of those Ivy League families that looks down on everyone else for not being born with prestige. I've always hated this idea, but they felt that I would outgrow it.

  Like all the men in my family, I was expected to go to law school and carry on the family tradition. I didn't. My entire life, I've wanted to be a dental hygienist. I'm not sure why, but it's always felt exceptionally enjoyable. I started my dental hygiene program last fall, to my family's dismay -- not only was I not going to be a lawyer, but I was going to be doing a ""woman's job,"" as they put it. They made a point to let me know that this is a job for normal people, not us.

  Fortunately, I've loved every moment of it. I adore the things I learn about and I can't wait for this next semester to begin. I'll begin actually seeing patients in the next few weeks, which has me over the moon. At my school, the students need to find their own patients, so I took to Facebook to try and drum up interest among my friends.

  My family didn't care much, naturally, but my girlfriend immediately began sharing with her friends and speaking with people that she thought might be interested in helping me. It was such an incredible feeling, knowing that someone is pushing me to succeed. She is incredibly curious in the things that I do, she asks me about what I'm studying, and she talks to me about what I love. I've never had this level of support from anyone before.

  I'm unspeakably grateful for what she is doing for me -- I feel rejuvenated at the thought of having someone backing me up and actually wanting me to do well. She gives so freely and is so generous with her support. I never could have imagined how wonderfully refreshing it feels to have someone who wants you to do well, and I can only hope that I can return the favor."

He had been fishing all his life. Operated a lobster boat for a time and he was my childhood hero. I wanted to be just like him when I grew up. This was a year before he died. Out in the middle of the bay casting out lines, trying to catch some mackerel for lunch. The last time we spent alone together. 

He had already caught three mackerel while I had yet to catch one. I was feeling a gauntlet of emotions at the time. Flustered, angry, embarrassed. My grandpa told me to calm down and kept trying to teach me the proper way to wave my line, jig it, reel it in. Telling stories of when he was a boy.

I asked, ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I be as good at this than you? I want to catch something big to show you that I can be as good a fisherman as you are!‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that what you think being equals means? Being able to do all the things I can do?‚Äù My grandfather had a sly grin on his face. A look I saw often. A monologue was incoming. 

‚ÄúK‚Äî-, ‚ÄúEquality doesn‚Äôt mean that someone can do all the things you can do. No one is capable of doing everything. Equality is having the grace to let others do the things you can‚Äôt do. When our skills cover each other‚Äôs lack of skill, that‚Äôs the most equal we could possibly be.‚Äù

My 10 year old brain had trouble processing this. I was equal with my grandad because of the things he couldn‚Äôt do? That didn‚Äôt make sense. Another thing I didn‚Äôt notice at the time was that my grandfather altered his teaching style. He would always start with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not very good at this, so let‚Äôs see how you are.‚Äù Or some variant of that. Trying to get me to see that I had potential to be better than him at something. To make us as equal as we could possibly be. 

Happy New Year."

It was amazing, I loved it immensely. I spent around a hour trying to find it for free (since your girl is BROKE and can't afford disney+ lol) and I am SO glad I did since it was so worth it. It really got me thinking about my life and my purpose in life, as well as everyone's purpose in life. 

In the movie, it talked about finding your 'spark' or finding your purpose, but what if we don't really have a ""real"" purpose? What if our actual purpose is just to exist?  Just to live life, and live in the moment instead of working for a purpose? Of course, every person still has a 'spark"", I just think your spark is your individuality and your passions and everything that makes you unique. It doesn't necessarily have to connect or be a purpsose in any sort, just something that makes you stand out from the rest. I don't know about you, but I think that brings some comfort to me. Recently I've been questioning a lot, my past, my sexuality, my future. Will my career be something I enjoy, and will it be part of my purpose on this earth? Do I even have a purpose? If so, what is it?  All these questions bubble inside my head and usually emerge at night right before I head to bed, and so tonight, after watching Soul (albiet 3in the morning), I think I'll have more reflections rather than questions. 

Soul really helped me remember to try and enjoy the little moments that occur in your day-to-day life, as opposed to focsuing on trying to fufill your 'purpose'. Obviously, it's easier said than done and its hard to realize when you lose yourself and what I think your spark is until it's too late and your a 'lost soul' as the movie described, but at least tonight I'll be thinking about what I enjoyed from today (like the shitty coffee I had but laughed it off with my friend, looking at the pretty sky after sunset, the mini dance party I had with myself, the new card game I learned etc) rather than my questions. 

 This post was very random and a bit cheesy and quite nonsensincal, but to be fair its 3 am so who fucking cares if I make no sense or not. This was also a lot more philosophical than I intended it be, but fuck it I'm a stupid teenager. This may got lost in the sea in posts, and honestly, I don't really care if it does. It just felt really nice to formulate my thoughts and questions and reflections and realizations and broadcast it to the world, even if no one is listening. So thank you reddit and goodnight:))

I'm from Philippines, in mid 20's, grew up from a poor family and a breadwinner.

Lost loved ones during this pandemic, my grandma is sick and is getting weaker so I came up to this realization.

This coming 2021, I'll do my very best, work hard as much as I can to save up even a small capital to start a small business. Why? Because I want to give my family and grandma a good life and treat her with what she deserve.

I'd like to get and hear tips from successful business owners who were also once like me. Struggling but never gave up and succeeded in life.

Will truly appreciate every tips/suggestions/stories. Thank you so much and have a good day!"

In the world of today, we live in an era of abundance and/or excess, with an advancement that is so fast-paced that the rate keeps on skyrocketing by the second.

In the world of today, things are much more accessible, available and more possible than ever:

* Things can be accessed, stored and transferred in the blink of an eye and the world of today is literally swimming in an ocean of information (which is why it is called the information era)
* With the technology and the level of understanding of many things today, things can be made in a short period of time ‚Äì machines making thousands or even millions of products and pumping them out and great quantities
* And with the level of globalisation that we are in today, there are simultaneously many things and places around the world that are simultaneously expanding, advancing, producing, and doing and reacting in any way, place and form

This, of course, gives us a lot more room for variety and many things are of various degrees in quality, taste and so on.

&#x200B;

But then you will realise something.

You go to a video game store like Steam or go on Netflix, or a library, and you see all of these options.

&#x200B;

And to add to that, these lists often change as the algorithms are often updated, whether it is because of ongoing trends or things that fit in your recent activity or what you saw yesterday or better yet, what you did a Google search on yesterday or what you said on your smartphone microphone.

And to even add another thing to this, multiple¬†things are often constantly being updated and/or advance as well ‚Äì new TV episodes, sequels and prequels of stories, books, video games, or the current ongoing trends and discussions of every single fandom or news are constantly being updated like a Reddit thread that gets longer each time you refresh the page ‚Äì then add that to multiple threads being extended ‚Ä¶ and to add another layer to this, sometimes the home page even changes so may not always get the same list of contents twice on the main page.

&#x200B;

According to my understanding of human attention and memory, a human being can only do so much ‚Äì we have a limited attention span, our minds (while very capable and versatile) is limited in their brainpower, and to switch and shift from one subject to another is not really an easy thing to do (imagine switching subjects in a school in a short amount of time), let alone having to go deeper within each subject and hoping that the level inside your brain, whether it is knowledge or mental skill or attention or understanding, increases as well which also takes time, effort and a lot of mental and physical attention.

It is as though we are¬†given a lot of stuff that we can choose from like being in a candy store where there are also other kinds of candy stores and even other fancy stores around, where each one is filled to the prime with all kinds of delicacies and treats ‚Ä¶ but we can only buy or consume so much at a given rate, especially when we are told that these things may either get sold out or expire or die out because of changing trends.

It is like a bottleneck effect where we want to get all of the things and these things have a limited lifespan before their quality are deemed as good or relevant.

&#x200B;

Now, you might say that this is all a thing in the mind and maybe so.

Perhaps this is all done via unconscious social means because of peer pressure and you are anxious to consume these things like everyone else is so that you do not miss out on the fun but you miss out on other things or not be as immersed because you are doing it because you are pressured to do so and not because you want to.

Or it could be a psychological issue because you have lots of interests and hobbies and needs but can only do so much at any given rate similar to having an 8-hour shift where the lists of tasks are either increasing or updating and so on. Let alone that we currently live in an era that we constantly bombarded with stimulation and/or the need for stimulation and information over and over and over again with that constant feed and need of dopamine without rest or pause.

&#x200B;

**TLDR - I think that this is a real issue in the world of today, whether it is video games, TV, film, art, books, education, news, etc because many of us have lots of interests, whether it is in multiple subjects like you could be an artist and a banker; and/or interests in multiple creative entities in a particular thing like you can be a fan of multiple franchises and fandoms.**

**And I think that this is not only unhealthy for all of us but also something that is not talked about a lot or not discussed thoroughly on how to tackle this as the world keeps on advancing and producing and so on**"

And the same day she gave me the code to the building.  The same day I found out two of my co-workers were from Loas, and one Is from Kosovo and speaks Albanian. To which I replied in shock ‚ÄúShqiptar??‚Äù And he responded ‚Äúye-wait how the fuck do you know that?.‚Äù

This place is just heaven for me and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve every actually looked forward to going into a job every day.

Is there is heaven on earth this is it.

Agreement or disagreements?

Edit: one thing I realize I forgot to add is that long before I worked here, we had several tornadoes hit the area. And this restaurant literally made MASSIVE batches of stir fry and drove around the entire area in one of my co-workers vans distributing food to people who had been affected.

I just wanted to share a story about a cute barista who made me a latte :)

It was during my 2nd year of university and I had an hour break in between two lectures. I heard there was a piano in one of the common rooms on campus, so I decided to check it out and play for a bit.

There were quite a few people studying, so I was a little nervous and a bit worried of disturbing the other students, but no one seemed to mind. I didn‚Äôt notice at first that the common room was connected to a coffee shop, so while I was playing, a barista came up to me and left a latte on top of the piano and thanked me for the music. He made a cute heart design and ahhhhh, it felt like something out of a Wattpad fanfic or an anime lol. 

After finishing the drink, I returned the cup and thanked him. I really wanted to initiate conversation, but I was way too nervous and had to get to my next class. I think I came back a month later to play on the piano again (and potentially see him) and he made me another latte and thanked me for coming back! I really wanted to make a move, but it didn‚Äôt seem appropriate and honestly, I don‚Äôt think he was interested in me in that way. It seemed like he just really appreciated the music.

Well anyways, nothing really came out of it and that‚Äôs perfectly fine, but I still think about it every now and then lol. I really appreciated the gesture and it has encouraged me to approach guys first! 

I‚Äôm rambling now and this is getting long haha. If you made it this far, thank you for reading and hope you‚Äôre all enjoying the holidays!"

I‚Äôd write the script for about one volume/year, generally all in the same month, and then take 11 months off. I‚Äôd take a few weeks off work and write when my parents left on their annual trip, I‚Äôd spend the time at their house since they asked me to watch our family dog. This would take place in January. 

This year, thanks to covid, I decided to use the first few months of quarantine to bang out a few more volumes, and quicken the timeline a little bit. Scripting a volume per year really adds up the time count. I was pretty proud of myself that I was able to write 3 volumes in about 5 months, but I was also mentally exhausted from it and looked forward to putting my work away for months to come. 

We‚Äôre approaching January. Covid is still here, my parents will not be going on their vacation, my dog has passed, and I do not think I have the energy (or comfortable space) to write a volume this year. While it has me feeling bummy, I know all of that is okay in the grand scheme of things. I‚Äôm halfway through the series, and by my own estimate, I‚Äôm about 5 years away from finishing the scripts alone. 

With 5 volumes done, I‚Äôm currently looking at about 550 pages. I thought since I have so much of the script down, now may be a good time to look into the next step. 

This is where Reddit comes in, partly to give myself a virtual pat on the back, but also to look for direction. I can‚Äôt draw for my life, so my work still lacks character design, set design, and most importantly, an illustrator. I could always commission an artist, which looks likely, but even at a set rate per page, the price for that would be astronomical. Ideally I‚Äôd like to trade half the IP for the work, but even typing that sounds like a scam with no payoff, so I can‚Äôt imagine it sounds appealing to any artists. I‚Äôll likely be self publishing when the time comes because, well, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm spending all this time working on it just to keep it to myself.

For those who are still reading, I sincerely thank you, this went on longer than I thought it would. 

TL;DR: This post serves two purposes, one that is both venting and self-congratulatory, and one that seeks to answer questions. Questions such as, how should I go about bringing my idea to life when I can‚Äôt draw?"

It's not like that yet though
Neither of us have said anything of the sort
Besides her casually saying that get love life was bad
And that she never had a bf
I kinda just ignored that

She's just an amazing person, she's beautiful, kind, and has good grades which I find it hard to make friends with people who don't have good grades. She also just makes me happy.

Like people who had a creepy encounter in a dimly lit car park do you think they spend two paragraphs explaining why they found themselves in that car park, what the weather was like, and every other bit of context you never knew you needed because it‚Äôs a made up story? Or maybe they‚Äôve just been telling this story so much over the years it‚Äôs morphed into a novel?"
km7d8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/km7d8u/i_feel_like_it_use_to_be_a_lot_easier_to_make/,I feel like it use to be a lot easier to make friends online,3,0,1609217284.0,"I'm currently 27, but back when I was in my early 20's I had some health problems and so I spent a lot of time at home. I feel like i met these people through a lot of diferent ways. One way was simply video games. I played video games, and over time got involved with clans and stuff especially minecraft. The other way was through reddit or other various websites. For example there was one called ""experince project"" where people would share experiences and I got to know several people through that site. 

Faster forward a few years and I got over my health problems and I didn't spend a bunch of time at home anymore so I didn't really keep making friends through the internet. Fast forward some more and its BAM covid. Everything is on lockdown and so I figured ""this would be a good time to get to know people online again"".

It seems like its a LOT more dificult now. Maybe its because I'm a little older (ive noticed there are very few people in their late 20's to be met online). Ive noticed that people are a lot more defense right out the gate. There seems to be a pretty significant dip in maturity level (but that could just be because Ive gotten older myself). 

All in all, its become more difficult to make friends online. So how about you guys? do you think its become easier or more difficult."

Like, I feel something that I can identify as emotional pain, but have no clue why I'm feeling it, even if I rake my brain to try and figure out the reason from the environmental context.

I'm apparently so emotionally stunted, I think about some of the stuff for months afterward but just can't figure out the reason why.

Case in point: I beat a guy in a hand of poker by leading him to believe that I was, badly, trying to distract him with being charming, while in fact  I was doing the opposite: being nice and making compliments, while worrying that he had the lesser hand.

I felt pain through the whole hand, because I just knew that it would work. And it did.

I thought about it several times afterward. How that hand played, and the hurt I felt. Like not gut-wrenching pain, but quite acute, and the memory just hurt for a while afterward on the occasions I thought about it. I don't feel pain now, but am still puzzled by it.

I just have absolutely no idea why.

Contextual clue, it was an old guy I didn't have an interest in beyond being friendly that I met while being hospitalized a while ago. He was kinda flirty, in a half serious I guess, awkward way. And we were playing cards to pass the time. He kinda made overtures and I declined politely. He was good company during a moment I felt pretty distressed, but was also a bit bothersome with his ouvertures which remained polite. We are not in contact, and I don't think about the person, just that memory of feeling hurt, and puzzle about it.

Why did I feel hurt in that moment?

I'm sorry if I'm oblivious to some obvious explanation because that's basically the point."

I'm kinda starting to regret that decision honestly. This place just feels empty without all the people who made it worth living here. Most of my friends have either went away for college or are too busy for anyone atm. Today, I saw one of my best friends from HS at the grocery store (he was back in town for the moment cause he's off college rn) and it was, well it was bittersweet. He felt distant, almost like a stranger. 

&#x200B;

Then there's the lingering thoughts about girls I always wanted to try to talk to in HS but didn't have the courage to. Some of them are still around according to one of my best friends I have kept in contact with but...what's the point now? Nothing will come of it if I try to get in contact with any, we barely talked then and it'd just be wasting both their time and mine to try now. I'm finally starting to accept that really, there's nothing left for me here. Everyone else has either moved on or will be moving on soon, so I suppose it's time for me to as well. I can finally be free of this small town, and can finally hopefully find my place. Despite all my fond memories, I never really felt like I belonged here."

She wasn't at the vet's for probably a year. We were wearing masks but as soon as we entered the vet's office, the vet asked if that is ""the white, angry cat"". I've never seen that vet before (a lot of people work there) but my brother laughed and said ""Yeah, it's her"". 

Turns out that was the vet that treated Kira when my brother took her to the vet's a few years ago. Kira was not having it, she was hissing the enitre time. The vet had to call 2-3 men to hold Kira so the vet could treat her, but Kira wouldn't be still even when forced. They left her for a few minutes with my brother to calm down and she was purring and enjoying herself until the vet came back and Kira started hissing again.

I don't know what it is with Kira and her hatred for vets. We had to take her to the vet a lot when she was a kitten but I have no idea when she started to hate them with such a passion. She was relatively calm back then and nothing happened that I could thing off that could've triggered her behaviour. I was with her every time except that one time my brother took her when she got stung by a bee.

This time she was hissing again but the vet managed to take a look at her. As soon as the vet was done, Kira went into her carrier and laid down with a grumpy face. When we got home, she was the loving cat she usually is."

Hey everyone!

So, I'm never really one to do this, but, I have nothing to lose at this rate, and I thought what better place to reach people than Reddit:/ ahaha.

So, as the title suggests I am looking for womxn who have been victims of FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) to be a part of my photo project, which will be published Summer 2021, hopefully. I know it's not an easy thing to discuss (I am someone who's a victim themselves), but it's a huge reason why this project means so much to me! I know the difficulties associated with openly discussing such sensitive matters, which is why I'm using my voice to break that silence. I've battled against cultural stigmas my whole life, but I've now reached an age (22), where I don't want young girls to feel like they can't speak about it. I'm reclaiming my voice, and my altered body, and I want others who have been through it too, to do the same. I've never met anyone who has been through it too, and I feel like my project will at least open a safe space and dialogue.

Now, I know it's heavy, so, if you want to discuss it further, let's have a social distanced walk? Ahaha, or a coffee? Or a zoom? Whichever you prefer. Everything said will be treated with the utmost discretion, and the pictures taken won't include faces, just the things that resemble you, the parts of your personality that emulate power!

If you're interested, or you have more questions, please reach out!

I didn't know what forum to put this on as well so I really don't want anyone attacking please ahaha, I don't have it in me to deal lool

Month and a half of trying.

All of these 4 dudes, were pretty decent and somewhat nice to me. 

I was fishing by myself. I was doing some self chatting with myself, to practice with my voice, to get used to talking on a public chat which is something I have been doing for quite a while on Sea of thieves public solo servers. For weeks and weeks.

And it paid off I guess.

While I was fishing some fish on my small boat, I saw this huge galleon heading towards me on my 3.

For some reason, I didn't even think about muting my mic. I knew I had it on...but, I just couldn't turn it off. I just stared at the galleon, 

Told myself that I just had to do it TODAY. I had to FIGHT IT, TODAY. This was THE TIME.

Then suddenly, I just began... talking, babbling away quietly to myself as the ship was already close to my sloop. 

Then these 4 guys who hopped around their ship like little toads, one guy got on the very front of the ship and spoke aloud and asked me if I wanted to come with them on a mission, while two others guys talked in the back.

.....My voice couldn't come out for a split second. I was hesitant. I wanted to turn my mic off. 

But then, 

I just opened my mouth and finally spoke! 

I sounded awkward, which was expected. Quiet, as well. 

And these guys weren't judgmental, rude right off the bat. They were all pretty nice guys. 

And they all called me a girl. Which surprised me. Because, I always thought I had an ugly boyish voice...hence, the never using my mic. 

I declined kindly. Told them I was gonna continue doing my own mission, fishing. 

They were chill with it, they were chill with ME, they treated me like another human being. They chatted some more with me, about miscellaneous stuff. They almost wanted to take my boat, but let me have it in the end. They stole my cat unfortunately. They cannon balled my cat while they were at it.

After their small harmless ,calm, chill visit-

I just saw them sail away.....

.....Then I was hit with the most happiest feeling inside me. Like I accomplished something. I felt like crying a little bit. 

So,

Today, 

I made PROGRESS. 

I am CHANGING and IMPROVING. 

You can do it, me. 

You can do it.

I used to sell curated playlists to restaurants and bars, back in the day when streaming was not an option, kinda like a mercenary DJ. You need music warm enough to feel content, but not overly energetic to distract yourself from the chat, the meal, the people around you.

Its music for backround, but not just a lo-fi playlist that bores you after 30 minutes. You're not doing homework, its not about concentration, you dont want contemplative music and not quite a party.

I wanted to hear more about it from her, so I pulled up the app I have to use to talk to her. I tried to write a new message but after selecting her name it told me ‚ÄúThis prisoner is not available for contact, they have been released.‚Äù


I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I immediately saved my screen and sent it to everyone. Anyone that I had told her story to was elated and so was I.


She got me into gaming, her SO at the time and her got me an original xbox. It came with Fable and I still remember ‚ÄúChicken Chaser‚Äù


I remember one time I wanted to rent a game, so she took me. I took my precious time as a child, she was and still remains to be extremely patient. I pick out a game, she pays, we get home, I play the game for 20 minutes and then IMMEDIATELY beg her to take me to get a new one. (I know I was spoiled) Being the big softy she is, she took me back two different times. And the last time I just got the same game as the first trip, GTA: San Andreas.


But yeah, it‚Äôs the thing my dad has been fighting for for the past ten years. He finally gets his daughter back and it makes me so just HAPPY that his work finally paid off. He‚Äôs been trying nonstop for 10 years to get anyone in power to just read the case and see that she shouldn‚Äôt have needed to be in prison for life without parole. 


The only downside is that I can‚Äôt be there to see her get out since I had to relocate to Florida :(


Thanks for reading!

My neighbor in the building next door is a nice older woman (lovely lady who just sits on her stoop all day) - We grew up in the same area so we get along pretty well/chat when we see each other. She‚Äôs also an avid gardener and will sometimes pay some of the homeless people in the neighborhood to help her with her garden. They‚Äôre all really great guys and I run into them often when I‚Äôm heading to/from work. 

The story:
I work late sometimes, but my usual evenings consist of getting home, maybe hopping on the internet for a bit, and then having a drink and listening to music. Anyways, cut to a random night last summer -

I had a tough week and was leaning out of my living room window smoking a cigarette (this would have been around 1 AM). As I looked out I saw that one of the dudes that helps my neighbor out was standing on her stoop with a bag of groceries. Dudes about 60/65 years old with a leather jacket and long hair - looked like a classic rocker. As I was smoking, I noticed him taking lunch meat and bread out of his bag. He started making a sandwich on the stoop, and, as an observation, he just seemed generally stoked for the sandwich to come. As I watched him put it together with excitement I thought ‚ÄúI should play some tunes for this dude‚Äù 

So I did. I knew my downstairs neighbor wasn‚Äôt in town (so the sound wouldn‚Äôt bother them) and I know you can hear my music on the sidewalk (where he was), so I tossed some Bad Company on... and He. Fucking. Loved It. 

When it started I was leaning out my window (maybe about 10 or 15 feet above him), and Dude didn‚Äôt even bother to look around. He just paused for a moment, perked his ears, and the second he recognized the song he started dancing (while he continued to make his sandwich). 

I was kind of surprised he didn‚Äôt look up to see where the sound was coming from, but as it played and I saw him grooving and enjoying and I thought, ‚ÄúI mean, I gotta keep the tunes going‚Äù 

This dude and I (well, without him being aware that I was there), Jammed out to classic rock for like 2 hours. He was dancing by himself as he ate his sandwich, and once he was finished he started rocking some air guitar. After every song ended (as I was picking the next one) he would just pause and wait until he recognized the new melody/lyrics. Once he did he would smile and go right back into the air guitar/ singing. Dude knew the lyrics to every single song I played!

After the 2 hours it was about 3 in the morning and I was ready for bed, so I finally yelled down to get his attention. I just said ‚Äúhey dude‚Äù and he looked up at me for the first time all night - I asked ‚Äúsolid tunes, right?‚Äù And he responded ‚ÄúHell yea, rock on brother‚Äù . Then I tossed him a couple smokes, he said thanks and thanks again for the tunes, gave me an nod, and headed on his way. 

I know that‚Äôs not the most climactic ending, but for some reason I think about that night a lot and felt like I wanted to share the story. Don‚Äôt know why, but I love that memory; and, if dude is reading this now, keep rocking, brother ü§ü"

Covid-19 lockdown honestly seems like it happened three or four months ago and not almost a year ago. I guess because days have looked like each other and I haven't done anything to completely overhaul myself .. I just feel like I wasted so much time? My job does not give me as much joy that it did before, and has kinda stagnated. I am applying to grad school next year, so much shit to figure out, so many people to talk to and I am here basically the same guy I was, waiting for 2020 to come in. I look at other people studying hard, skilling themselves, doing online courses, completing their standardised tests. Me on the other hand: I wait for things to come close, panic and half-ass things.

I live in a house with 3 of my siblings, my mom, and my stepdad. We're all independent of each other because we all have different schedules and needs, so we don't eat together. I've come to realize that my youngest sister has greatly taken advantage of that. She wakes up before the rest of us and lays in bed until the next person gets up, which is me. She asks me everyday to make her an egg while I make my breakfast. I make her an egg and toast I make myself some eggs and we eat together pretty much every morning. Then my stepdad wakes up and usually by then I'm already at work, but because I haven't been working I was in my room. I heard her ask him to make her oatmeal. He makes her oatmeal and makes his oatmeal then they eat together every single day roughly an hour after I make her breakfast. Then my stepdad goes to work and my other sister wakes up. The little one asks her for frozen waffles and they eat waffles together every day after she eats her oatmeal. Then my brother gets up at around noon and makes pizza bites or a hot pocket or something like that and she asks him to make some extra for her. He does and they eat their junkie lunch together everyday.

Basically, my youngest sister gets up to 4 breakfasts a day because we don't communicate about who is feeding her, so everyone just does it. She knows our schedules and plans her feeding times around them.

Edit: To everyone thinkng that she's being neglected, abused, not properly cared for, going to get obese, or anything else negative like that- go away don't bother commenting. I've gotten plenty of those already and I'm sick of defending myself to a bunch of strangers. I know what's going on in my house and family better than any random on reddit who has never met any of us and clearly knows nothing about children. Thanks:)"

I‚Äôve written a post in the past (that I can‚Äôt find!) about how a simple change of scenery could make any aspect of life new and exciting ‚Äì how visiting a day-time familiar place at night could be a new place altogether. Or how that inspiring morning walk with a loved one could become a reflective starlit encounter of appreciation and soul searching.

Similar to how painting a room in your house brings a new energy or feeling, as does painting the world a color of streetlamps,  [moon](https://radiantpublishinghouse.com/2019/06/05/luna-of-the-moon/)\-glow , and [starlight](https://radiantpublishinghouse.com/2019/06/19/my-life-as-a-star/). Watch how to hot black asphalt of a sun-kissed parking lot transforms into a picturesque album cover or romantic stage for a twilight dance with your partner. The playground you‚Äôre too old to go on during the day? No judgement now! And, I wonder if your dog likes slides?

Your laundry, dishes, and the next episode of whatever keeps you in that chair ‚Äì all that can wait! I promise it will all be there when you get back from your 30 minute twilight walk (especially the dishes, no one will do them for you).

So tonight, I challenge you to a night of adventure, soul searching, and rediscovery ‚Äì if ***living*** is your kind of thing. Pick your favorite creature (human or animal) or even just your most precious pair of shoes and go for a walk somewhere you once thought familiar. Bring your flashlight and phone for safety, but tonight is about embracing the world as it is in the darkness ‚Äì so be sure to turn it off until your eyes adjust and truly appreciate the beauty of the night.

Don‚Äôt even take the time to think of an excuse, just go =)

With love,

I called the Dr and headed in. They came out to my car to test me with the rapid test. It came back negative. The Dr came out to tell me and asked my symptoms. He sent them back out to take a second swab that touched my eyeball and it had to ve sent off.

Called the boss man and let him know the Dr. took me off work until the test came back. 

At this point, I was feeling cruddy, but not terrible. The test was just to follow our work protocols.

Wednesday the Dr called with the bad news.

I called the boss man to let him know and then started calling every co. I owe money to and asked for deferred payments. All of them were quite accommodating.

Wife called her job, healthcare provider, and let them know what was going on. They told her that she had to quarantine for 14 days after I was cleared. That'll put her off until mid-late January.

But, since Wednesday, pretty sure her and the kids have gotten it. They're going to try to get tested today. We were together all weekend, and before symptoms kicked in.

So now, I've had it for a full week.

Mon-Wed weren't too bad. Like a cold coming on.

Wed night it turned into a dick in dirt situation and I went from not too bad, to holy crap make it stop.

That lasted through Thursday.

Since Wednesday, sleep has come very irregularly and sometimes an hour or two, other times all day naps.

We did our Christmas with the kids Thursday because the wife was starting to feel bad and I was worse for wear. Wanted to knock it out just in case Christmas day we were worse.

Friday morning I was feeling ok. I kept tossing and turning and finally got up about 4pm. I felt ok, until I got out of bed. Dizzy and stomach aches with major body aching.

Wife was feeling cruddy, but not terrible.

Saturday was about the same. Wife got a little worse. But neither of us were terrible. Oldest daughter was complaining of body aches and cruddiness. 

Sunday, I started coughing. Been coughing on and off all night. Deep breaths are cold and mildly painful with the cold air inhaling.

Sunday, wife got body aches and lightheaded. Everything is a chore to do.

Sunday, oldest daughter still feels cruddy and can't taste anything but sweet stuff. Says anything sweet tastes like eating a sweet n low packet.

So far, our youngest seems to have avoided it. Hopefully it misses her altogether.

For the record, we both wear masks pretty much anytime we've had to go in public. I'm anal about hand washing and have been long before covid came on the scene. I keep alcohol spray bottles in several places around my office and in all of our vehicles.

I'm about the worst when it comes to hand washing and sanitizer. To the extreme that my coworkers will poke fun because I constantly wash my hands.

No matter what I did, we still wound up with this crap."

That's all nice, and I get that they're just trying to cheer me up but still. All these things come from people in (mostly) happy relationships though and my thoughts are just, ""easy for you to say.""

&#x200B;

None of that makes any of this any easier either. Sure, maybe I *will* find someone eventually, but what do I do about my loneliness until then? Even if I knew for an absolute fact that I would eventually meet someone (which I don't) that really would do nothing to help me right now. So what, I just learn to ""love myself?"" Well guess what? I've tried that, it didn't help one damn bit. It made me feel less stressed about my own personal choices, but it didn't make me feel any less lonely at all. No matter how people deny it, we're social creatures and no matter what it's incredibly difficult to truly be fine without someone else. Sure, I love my friends but over time we've all become more and more distant. We've been trying to keep in touch, and we do, but it's not at all the same.

&#x200B;

Idk, I guess this loneliness I've felt for most of my life (never really had caring parents) is starting to get to me. Especially this year with social distancing and all. I'm tired and depressed. I think I'm gonna go to bed now."

Years ago, her first daughter was born, but not long after, her relationship went sour & she's been a single mom ever since. Because of the custody agreement, she's never been able to move away, but from time to time, we've had ""what if"" types of conversations since her daughter was a baby. It was just to add a bit of levity to our friendship, but the time was so far away, I don't think either of us really gave it any serious thought.

Over the years, we've dated other people & lived our lives. There have been times that we've lost contact for years at a time, but eventually, we always find each other again. Somewhere along the line, she had another daughter, but she has full custody of her. 

For the past several years, hardly a day has gone by that we haven't talked & the ""what if"" conversations gradually turned into ""when"" conversations. It has always been as friends, which is fine with both of us. We're very close & talk about everything, but it's never been any more than what it is. 

We've been talking about her temporarily staying at my place while she gets on her feet & finds a place of her own. Her oldest turns 18 in another 6 months or so, so at this point, we've actually been beginning to make plans for her move.

I texted her this morning that there was something on my mind & to call me when she had time to talk. Nothing bad, just stuff regarding the move.

About an hour ago she called & we talked about our day, like we do every day. Then, I brought up the upcoming move & different things going on in our lives.

If you aren't into electronic music, know that as someone who's life is electronic music (producer, DJ, and fanatic that listens for hours a a day, every day) deadmau5 is so much more than just a DJ, as he is most commonly known. He's an innovator. A creative genius. Someone who creates music from the heart.

 He made an album in which he converted dance songs of his into full orchestral compositions. He's broken boundaries, created genres, and shaped the definition of electronic music as a whole. Not only has he mastered his craft as a producer. His shows combine insane visuals created by him (showing how he creates them in free live-streams). He often spends months creating them for only one particular tour, or show. Unlike most DJ's, he strictly plays his own music in shows, which adds to the beauty of it all. 

As someone who is entering the world of music, I assure you that the majority of electronic music artists are driven by all the wrong reasons. Money, fame, streams, you name it. A good handful of electronic music artists you've probably heard of don't even produce their music. Most don't master it. Deadmau5 does it all.  It is clearly visible when someone is driven by pure passion, and deadmau5 is one of them. He is one of the greats. 

If you reading this you're probably one of the few people that give a shit about this post! Some of my personal favorites of deadmau5 are ""Right This Second"" ""Raise you Weapon"" and ""I Remember"", so if you like what you heard with 777, I highly recommend checking these out!"

kliwje,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/kliwje/i_bought_myself_a_skateboard/,I bought myself a skateboard!!,10,5,1609128633.0,I've always wanted a skateboard since I was little. My friend has been helping me decide on a beginner board for the last YEAR and I finally went and ordered it as a birthday gift to myself! I spent like 170$ but it was so worth it. I rode for hours last week when it came and didnt fall ONCE. This board is so nice and I'm so happy I finally decided to get one. The only downside is its winter now and it just snowed here so I'll have to put it up for a while...but it's alright. I feel pretty confident in being able to turn and go forward. I used to have a 20$ Walmart board that could barely turn or go fast so I practiced on it to get confident. I hope soon ill be able to learn some tricks!! Anyone else learning to do something they've wanted forever? It feels so worth it.

I don‚Äôt know if it was 3 or 4) and this year we kinda celebrated it again just by giving presents and spending time with my siblings whether over the phone or in person. However I usually expect my parents to get me a hot wheels car and a cheap lego set (I‚Äôm 18 btw) or I just know what they are getting me because I have to straight up tell them. But they never know what to get me... cause I don‚Äôt know what they should get me and I always just wanted them or someone to know me well enough to just get me something unexpected but I don‚Äôt have a bunch of close connections like a friend group or anyone right now for that matter and I‚Äôve wanted that for a long ass time. 

However today I got a present that was actually unexpected and something I appreciate a lot. I got a bean bag pillow. I use a bean bag pillow because I wear headphones to bed and if you have a firm pillow it hurts your ears a ton but a bean bag pillow on top of a good pillow is pretty much perfect. I have had my siblings one forever but it is kinda close to the end of its life cycle so this new one is very appreciated. 

I guess moral of the story is guys I finally got a present that didn‚Äôt end up disappointing me and leaving me sad after I thought about how I don‚Äôt have a lot of connections with people and end up feeling like nobody cares about me and I‚Äôm worthless. I like my gift and it is very much appreciated. Thanks mom and dad.

I managed to put together a handful of holiday Hersey Kisses, a small Dr. Pepper I packed for the road, and an unopened pack of gum. I put them in a cute snowman bag and made sure to stop back by the drive thru before leaving.  For those who aren't familiar, Portillo's usually staffs someone outside by the menu who will take your order and process payment, so I walked up to find this girl ran inside to the bathroom so I left the treats next to her coat.

My car caught on fire tonight while I was driving. Don‚Äôt know why, the report still isn‚Äôt back. My car was fine until maybe a half hour before, and even then I thought I‚Äôd be able to get home alright. It broke down and caught fire less than a mile from my house.

I‚Äôm thankful I didn‚Äôt kill anyone and I‚Äôm very thankful for the kind women and her daughter who got out of their car to help me. If not for them, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have known it was on fire and therefore had been in the car when the fire started. 

Even though I or someone else could‚Äôve gotten hurt, I‚Äôm not thinking about that. All I can think about is money. The car was older than I am, so I‚Äôm probably not going to get much insurance money for it. As I‚Äôm on break from university right now, my only source of income for the next month is driving for a third party delivery service, which is hard to do without a car.

Hi, so I'm (M20) want to help my younger sister who's 12. I care for my sister a lot, and ever since I've been away from home a lot (I'm in the army), I started having some more serious conversations with her.



My sister is not very confident, not in her looks and not in her social skills, and because of that she is pretty lonely and doesn't go outside much (this has obviously worsened this year with the virus, but it's not the cause of her problem). She had started middle school this year, which means she has a lot of new opportunities to talk to new people.






She does have a few close friends, but most of them kinda have a bad influence over her, and regardless she doesn't hang out with them very often.



It might seem like I'm just assuming her thoughts and feelings, but most of this is things she talked with me about. I don't want/expect her to suddenly be the most confident and outspoken person in the world, but I just really wish she had the confidence to try and connect with new people.




Also, a large part of my efforts is the fact that I was in a similar situation in her age - not very confident and felt very akward to talk to new people (and even some old friends), which led me down a pretty bad road towards high school, but ever since I was done with that and joined the army I've been on a relatively upward trend of confidence.








I'm not sure what causes my difficulty to express what I think to her, perhaps it is our age gap and perhaps it's the fact we have had very different childhoods and have different interests, but I would really like help from someone who has more experience with situations like this, thank you.

It prolongs the tasting journey and it sometimes unlocks a texture/flavour combination that you cant get any other way.  It is usually desert  type items, but I've been know to do this with the odd savoury dish as well.
  
Perfect example was this cherry cheesecake I just had for dinner tonight.  I gobbled the first few bites and it was incredible.  Then I slowed down, took a good size piece and just let it rest between my tongue and roof of mouth.  The gritty texture of the crust, combined with the wonderful sweetness of the cake and the slippery cherry topping was just a delight to linger on for a few minutes while it fell apart and I slowly swallowed.

Before Christmas I start thinking about things I would like to accomplish or change the next year. It can be anything like reading more to more exercise to journaling. Sometimes they stick and sometimes they don‚Äôt. However this year the thought of coming up with a resolution just felt incredibly overwhelming. With all the changes, evolutions and sacrifices we have all had to make it just seems like too much to add something else in. But I have come to the conclusion that that is ok. We are allowed to just relax and find our new normal. If anything from 2020 we can learn is how precious life is and the things that really matter to us. It‚Äôs ok to be kind to yourself and appreciate the small things that make life wonderful. Sometimes it‚Äôs ok to slow down and embrace yourself in the moment. 

Maybe that can be a resolution is to find those small things and embrace them in others and ourselves."

They are open for take-away and delivery, so we decided to get some and eat it in the nearby park. 

We make our order, and my daughter gave each of the three employees who were working in the area she could see at that time a euro as a 'tip' and a thank you for working on christmas instead of being with family. She has a little pouch for her money, which are all 1 and 2 euro coins that she can spend on whatever she likes. We are allowed to help her, but in the end she gets to pick what she buys, and this time she spend it on people working during christmas. 

Either way, we take a seat at the park, and in her happy meal she finds extra sets of the toys, three extra to be exact. It also had a note in each of the three extra bags, each saying something along the lines of ""Thank you for your kindness, merry christmas."" from each of the three employees.

Easy access to running water in the city makes people forget its significance and take it for granted. Remember to be grateful for what u have.

Not saying at all that taking long showers is bad as i believe if it relaxes people and takes their mind off other things they should probably do it occasionally. But make sure it dosent become a habit."

For me much of it wasn't even due to Covid. I worked on my practical diploma project in paintings conservation, which was extremely stressful for me. As a conservator you're working with originals so naturally you have a lot of responsibility and mistakes often are not talked about. 

After I realised I had made a mistake resulting in some (minor) damage I started spiralling into a personal crisis where I questioned EVERYTHING. I suffered from insomnia and for the first time in my life I had panic attacks, which was really scary. 

But I pulled through! By talking to my friends, my mentors and to a counselor who really helped me. When our university closed due to Covid it helped me relax a little bit more. Of course the project continued to be very stressful and there were actually many many times when I thought I wouldn't make it and I would fail my diploma. But in the end I finished my diploma successfully - I even got an A! 

I am really proud of myself. I overcame my personal crisis by seeking and accepting help. At the time it really seemed like the end of the world though everyone tried to tell me that it would get better. And they were right.

Really what I'm looking to figure out is if there would be a way - either technical or by some other means to find try make a solution to that.   


So if you have tried to make friends on the internet, what issues did you run into besides the common ones (below)?  


* Difficulty starting a conversation/getting to know each other 
* Difficulty to find  common things to talk about
* Ghosting
* Not getting any effort put into the conversation by the other person
* Being judged on a particular trait -  something like being depressed, a health condition or a decision like dropping out of school/tattoos  


Is it perhaps the internet and social media corps making everyone less impatient and empathetic? In what way could they change to be better? I've heard that twitter is trying out a new experiment to show 'things in common' with people you're tweeting at if they detect you're tweeting something 'impolite' - which I thought was rather cool.  


I'm actually involved in a project that revolves around finding friends on the internet so all your suggestions here would be really helpful. Thank you!! :D"

However, at one point it came too close to my delicious lamb chop and I thought to myself enough is enough. I silently put my knife down and in one quick sweep, I managed to grasp the little bugger in my bare fist. I was livid. A big smile came across my face as my family was simply in awe and amazed at the prospect of it. I then slowly got up and gently threw the carcass of the now crushed fly into the sink and witnessed its lifeless body spiral down the drain.

kl8xfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/kl8xfo/noisy_family/,Noisy family,3,4,1609094867.0,"Growing up there was **a lot** of drama in my family. My grandmother (dad's mom) was making our lives hell, told lies about my mom so my dad's side of the family didn't like her much, to say the least, there were fights, name calling, and ultimately everyone stopped talking to each other. After my parents talked with some of the family and cleaned out the air, everything was ""fine"" again. 

My dad's uncle and all of his grown up children and grandchildren live in another country and uncle B comes to our country every summer on vacation. Since he's an elderly man and his wife can't travel, my mom makes him food when he's here and dad helps him if he needs any help. They really bonded over the past years, even his wife (my dad's aunt) calls every now and then just to chat with my mom and to catch up. I think that's sweet.

Now my parents don't have much of a relationship with some of uncle B's children because they haven't seen each other in years and, well, life happens. So today, one of uncle B's daughters called my parents just to chat. She was talking to uncle B and aunt A, and somehow they mentioned my dad so she thought she could call him. My parents, of course, appreciated that and loved talking to her and catching up. So they talked about this and that and, of course, about their children.

Uncle B's daughter asked them how I am and for some (to me unknown reason) my mother started talking about my boyfriend. Keep in mind, I don't live at home, this is what my parent's told me happened. So the main conversation about ""me"" was uncle B's daughter asking who my boyfriend is, what his last name is, where his family is from... And of course my mother provided all the information. When will we get married? Hopefully when they can come to our country to be part of the celebration.

Seriously? Yeah, they are family, but I wouldn't invite them to my wedding (whenever that happens) for more than one reason. I have no contact to those people. I wish them all the best, but I honestly don't care if I'll ever see them again (except for uncle B, he was always nice to us).

So now I'm really annoyed that my parents share all of that with people who are basically strangers to me. It's not a secret that I'm in a relationship, nor who my boyfriend is, but it doesn't sit well with me that they are so nosy and my parents don't mind. I seriously consider telling my parents to not share information with people I don't know. If they want to know more, they can contact me and I'll tell them to mind their own business.

My brother says it's idiotic of them to ""decide"" when and how I'll get married and to just ignore them. But now all I can think of is my dad's noisy cousin searching my boyfriend on Google, Facebook, Twitter... to have something to gossip about the next time she sees someone who knows I exist.

Do you know those noisy people? How do you deal with them?"

Anyway, there's something that has always bugged me, and I just cannot fathom otherwise, no matter what way you put it. Also it's kinda an added question for advice, but that's not what I'm trying with the post. 

So you've heard the expression 'money can't buy happiness'... I don't believe it at all. Over the pandemic, and many other points in time beforehand,  I had accumulated a loss in funds. After going back to work, or any time I have gained income back, I have felt free and I had depression, which dissipated as soon as I gained money. How, you may ask? Well you most likely all pay bills, right? I couldn't pay said bills, and it wasn't very much, but I have had issues with paying bills for a long time. During these times, I had all the symptoms of depression, but the point I had finally managed to clear the debt, I had honestly never felt better in my life. The only time, and I mean this, when I felt this good is when I was high on drugs. Sorry if that was a bit depraved or whatever, but it was just a perspective kinda thing. 

Now, the thing I'm always annoyed about, and I can guarantee there will be many that think and agree with this, is why on earth do you always see the super rich claiming that 'money can't buy happiness'? I personally never see anyone below the high tier wealth bracket saying this. The annoying part isn't them saying this, but the fact they always do it while flaunting all their expenditures, and people around them, that you'd honestly have such great times with, but only with that vast amount of wealth(cars, famous genuine people, beautiful people, wonderful houses, attention, dare say sexy women, being able to gift others money at will etc.) 

Does anyone feel the same way, and do you honestly believe this statement? Like, basically unlimited money gives you the means to do whatever you want, so in essence, you're basically living like money never existed, because you need not worry about anything.

Thanks, sorry if it seems like venting, but it's something I think of fairly frequently."

Anyways, me and my friends met each other since 3rd grade (We're in highschool now) and we were inseparable ever since.

We would always text about our secrets, the things we hate, the things we love. They're even knew my sexuality before I did. It's always fun to be around them and I feel happy when I hangout with them. A smile is always on my face when we do things together.

Since quarantine, I haven't seen them at all and we barely even text or say hello to each other, not even a Merry Christmas. Our conversations gone dry, I don't know the right things to say anymore and everyone is busy due to online class and homework even if class is not until January, not to mention one of them transfered to another school. 

I don't really know how to end this post so I'll just stop here. I'm just worried that we'll grow apart from each other and never talk again or maybe it's just anxiety kicking up. How are your friendships doing?"

I got myself all ready and true to being authentically Santa I had a Santa bag full of presents for the entire family and then we got to play with the kiddo and he had a blast.

One went to the first aid kit to get whatever it was there.  One gave me alcohol wipes, another one attempted to put the band aid on as quick as possible since the bleeding was happening fast.

I didn't know what else to do.  

Unfortunately the band aid didn't work, but they all kept trying by bringing me paper towels and a special sheet to contain the bleeding.  Out of random, another coworker of mine, came to where I was and asked if she can help.   Obviously, I was open for anything.  I don't know how she did it, but she found a bandage that was able to absorb the bleeding without making a mess, she taped the whole bandage in place, in which was surprisingly working.  She then had a special pair of latex gloves that were not transparent and I put it on.  It was somewhat tight, but it made the bleeding go under control and made me proceed working.  

Even in times of unexpenctancy, everyone teamed up together to help.  Even some that had no experience with this put the effort into helping.

I'm super grateful to have coworkers that care."

I only started watching Harry Potter movies on TV during the holidays and now I'm a bit sad that I didn't get interested in this franchise sooner. It's so awesome and I love the atmosphere and everything. 

I think I would have loved it even more, if I wasn't so close-minded and actually watched it, or maybe even read the books when I was like 13 or so (didn't like reading books at that age though, which is kinda sad too).

Now I really want to read all the books after I finish the movies. Although  I'm probably not the target audience anymore, lol.

Does anyone else here had a similar experience? Do you have any books, movies or tv series that you love, but found out about, or started to appreciate later than everyone else?

Oh, and no spoilers of Harry Potter pls, I only watched the first four movies."

We were always hanging out and exploring together, and I actually ended up catching feelings at some point, but I had to unwillingly cut him off. A mutual friend (or so I thought) at the time decided to go after him and thought I was in the way. Every time I would try to hang out with him, she‚Äôd show up and start flirting or trying to compete for attention, to the point where my mental health was being affected. I pulled him aside and communicated that it really seemed like she was interested in him, and then asked him if he had feelings for her. To my dismay, he said yes. Then I told him he would take a break for a while and distance myself. I needed time to heal and couldn‚Äôt do that if I was around them and they started dating. Needless to say, I was really sad. 

I understand that I probably didn‚Äôt handle it the most tactful and should have been more clear of my feelings, but before then I was lucky enough to have lived relatively drama free. Therefore, I was pretty new at this conflict resolution thing. Friend groups came and went during university, but I‚Äôve never quite connected with someone as close again. I got over the feelings back then, and just wanted my friend back, but always had the impression that he hated me for just cutting off all connections. I did get a bit sad when I realized with covid I might never see him again because of everything being remote. 

A few days ago I was eating dinner and I received a text from him. He wanted to catch up with me and invited me to hike with him sometime. It feels like that loose thread is finally being addressed, and I‚Äôm really relieved."

For me, while the pandemic has also affected me to some extent (at least indirectly), I feel that the pandemic was a lot better for me because it made me feel that everything was more manageable since the world was on pause.

Before the pandemic, life felt very fast-paced, very demanding and chaotic and competitive and it did not feel like a healthy way to live.

Now, I feel like I am able to go at my own pace.

Sure, it is boring sometimes but at least it is not as hectic or terrifying even.

&#x200B;

Not to mention the other good things that have happened since the pandemic began like lower levels of carbon emissions because of fewer flight travels and use of fossil fuels because everyone was working from home.

Yes, the pandemic has affected everyone and people are eager to go back to ""normal"" again but I honestly question what the word ""normal"" is because what was ""normal"" before the pandemic was almost unliveable."

Most of this messaging makes the case for one standard, nationwide, regardless of what state you live in. 

However, I also just learned that the effective minimum wage varies a lot from state to state. For example, in WA State, the effective minimum wage (i.e. the minimum sum of wage + tips) is $13.50 per hour whereas somewhere like Indiana it's $7.25. 

Do (or should) your own local dynamics play a role in your tipping habits? For instance, should people in Indiana tip more than people in WA given how much lower the effective wage is for tipped employees? Or it it more appropriate to have one standard?"

But I miss not having to worry about a parking spot, the AC, the chicken wings, the cute waitresses, not having to choose one game because they're all shown on multiple screens.

Then another coworker was asking everyone what I liked to eat cause he noticed I wasn't myself on Christmas Eve. So he bought me a pack of mini red velvet bundt cakes and told me why he did and I just hugged him for a solid minute and cried. I wasn't expecting a good day, and two coworkers out of nowhere made it a good day. I'm grateful for my coworkers, I'm grateful that they care, I know they care even when my brain repeatedly tells me no one does. After years and years of my own mind telling me I'm worthless, I'm slowly learning that I'm not. This year has been one of the lowest in my life, honestly probably the second lowest year after the one where I wanted to kill myself. Do I sometimes wish I wasn't alive? Sure, a lot of people do, but I do not want to kill myself. And even though this year was extremely difficult, today these to coworkers made my day amazing, and reaffirmed my resolve that I will not kill myself. I will not let the depression win.

I‚Äôve had a lot on my mind this Christmas and basically  down in the dumps because my family has decided to stay away from me because of COVID.  I am a nurse and work in a nursing home, my family considers it too risky to be around me (which makes no sense since I‚Äôm tested twice weekly and we have no confirmed cases, but I digress.) This Christmas was the worst for me, but you know who is even worse for?? The residents of the home where I work.  They depend on visits from family (and that is rare even pre-COVID) but now they depend solely on phone calls.  The thing is, nobody has time for the elderly.  I‚Äôm not saying this to be cruel, but it‚Äôs mostly true and I was guilty of it too before I had to witness it firsthand.  It‚Äôs the most awful thing a person could imagine.  Even a 5 minute call can change someone‚Äôs whole mood and it will be all the resident talks about for days.  On Christmas Day I worked on a unit with 10 patients, less than half of them had phone calls.. most got cards with pics of new great grandchildren or slippers/pajamas.  Sorry for the rambling, but just want to encourage people to call their loved ones (the ones not in nursing homes too.) I‚Äôm really not trying to make anyone feel guilty just trying to remind people to take a few minutes to make someone important feel special and loved, and isn‚Äôt turn, it will make YOU feel better as well!  Much love and hope everyone enjoyed the holiday as much as it could be enjoyed given the circumstances.  

Also, don‚Äôt want to minimize anyone‚Äôs lost loved one due to COVID, I‚Äôm very sorry to anyone who has lost someone to this horrible virus!"

For me it was..,7,1,1609044742.0, I'm fifty seven. In my twenties while working as a scaffold builder in a refinery myself and two others were carrying a forty foot peg board which is a long aluminum platform used as a walkway for workers. They had one end and I the other. To complicate matters we were wearing full body harnesses for fall protection and it had been raining for days a the ground was extremely muddy. We were crossing a large timber matt they put down for cranes to operate on. This matt was maybe two feet thick. One of the guys Jose was very short barely five foot. As he stepped off the matt they let go of the board and I was going to shove it as far as I could across the matt. Unbeknownst to me the end of the board hung on one of his lanyards that were draped by his side. As the board moved forward he slowly disappeared behind the matt and from my perspective it looked like he was going down a flight of stairs. After the board quit moving and I made my way over to them the other guy was laughing. I get there to see Jose pinned to the ground in the mud by the board and his harness. When he's finally free and stands up he's completely coverd in mud. Especially the side of his head that was in the mud. There was mud in his ears mouth and all around his eyes. The two of us were belly laughing as he stood up smiling with mud in his teeth and the gold tooth just added too it. I excused myself to a water cooler to regain my composure. After several minutes when he came walking up the laughter began again. I could not look at him without laughing with tears in my eyes to the point that my stomach hurt. I'm on the verge of giggling still just thinking about it... I can understand if you don't find this humorous but that was hands down the funniest thing I've ever seen...second to the guy on another job that couldn't ride one of those work tricycles. He actually found a way to tip it over and fall off...

kkwlqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/kkwlqa/stories_from_band/,Stories from band,1,0,1609041144.0,"I‚Äôm here to tell you some of my most ridiculous stories from my band class. to start off with some backstory, I‚Äôm a freshman in high school and 14F. I‚Äôve been in band since I was 10, and this year I started a program called indoor percussion. Think of it as marching but, but strictly for percussionists. The people marching are the kids that play drums or ‚Äúbattery.‚Äù This includes snare, bass drum, and tenor. I‚Äôm in front ensemble, which is xylophones, auxiliary percussion (tambourines, maracas etc.) and synthesizer, which is what I play. The class includes all high schoolers, freshman to seniors. Next is the cast, which includes (fake names) Carlos, (drum set) Spencer (marimba) John (aux) Jerome (aux) Olivia (xylophone) Dylan (vibraphone) Harry (marimba) and me (synth) Harry is a British foreign exchange student, and Carlos is Mexican. Last but not least is our band directer, Katie. 

1. The first day.
The first day was an absolute disaster..
First of all, nobody brought their mallets, so during ‚Äúpractice‚Äù (simple scales) everyone just stood there until the school owned mallets were cleaned. It took probably like, 20 minutes where we all just looked at each other. We used that time to introduce ourselves, and I KID you not, all of them are high school stereotypes. Carlos is a complete nerd, Spencer was a basket case, John was a Boy Scout/ bear grills outdoorsy dude, Jerome was the guy everyone hates for no reason, Olivia was a nice girl, Dylan was a country boy, Harry was the bad boy (or trying to be) and I was just trying to figure out what was going on. It was hilarious how much they looked and acted the part too. Then, when I was trying to set up my synth, (first time setting it up ever) it straight up didn‚Äôt work for like an hour. After everyone has gotten their sticks, I was the one sitting and waiting for the band directors to fix it. Long story short, it was very stressful, but I still look back at it and laugh 

2. Things i over hear
When I listen to the conversations they are just ridiculous. One time, Carlos, Spencer, and Dylan were all talking. The conversation went like ‚ÄúD: imagine playing bingo, but all you win is beans. C: What kind of beans? A whole can or just individual beans? S:Individual beans! D: let‚Äôs call it beango!(Laughter) C: since you can win beans from regular bingo does that mean beans are currency? Bean banks? Bean loans? Bean donations? Band director: What are you guys talking about? C: The bean stalk market. Another time they were like ‚ÄúD: what do you think about possums? C: Possums? The ones with the rat tail? D: Yeah, what do you think of them? C: Idk their gross. D:Why? C: The rat tail. D: No that‚Äôs what makes them cool! This conversation went on for the rest of our 20 minute break 

3. The pizza delivery
This happened when we had a long 7 hour practice from 9-4 one Saturday. We were allowed to have a lunch break, but we couldn‚Äôt leave school grounds. Most kids just got their parents to deliver McDonalds for them, but Carlos and Dylan were not having it. They decided to order a pizza from Pizza Hut. Dylan went outside the room at lunch time and had the job of ordering a pepperoni and a cheese pizza. He called, and came back in the room saying they wouldn‚Äôt deliver because it was too far. Carlos got up and was like ‚Äúhow is it too far? The Pizza Hut is just down town?‚Äù They checked the number and he called the one in a neighboring town instead of ours! They decided to just order one from dominos instead and Carlos called instead. The pizza was delivered an hour after lunch because of the Dylan delay. When it came, they ate it and charged Jerome 10 bucks to have some after the band directer just let them have it. After they finished, they still had most of a cheese pizza left over which they let me eat for free. Best. Day. Ever"

At the end of the day, the last thing we were going to see was the lions before the zoo closed and we left for the day.  


So me and my boyfriend are just chilling, there are 3 adorable baby cubs at the zoo, we are watching them play, 3 lioness and the male lion laying on a big rock catching the last rays of sun that is reaching the enclosure.   


It starts off with one of the lioness jumping up on the rock and walks next to the male lion, and she just starts poking his back with her paws. I'm thinking she's trying to play with him, I'm talking to my boyfriend like ""why is she messing with him the man just trying to sleep"" then it starts getting very serious. The lioness like bites at his backside, so he kinda roars and turns around towards her, and at that moment the other two lioness in the enclosure pounced. See while I was focusing on the male, the other two lioness had crept up on either side of him to circle him, so there were 3 lioness on each side of him. 

When he had turned to roar at the first lioness that attacked him, she backed off, and the other two darted in and started either clawing or biting at his back. And they kept doing this to him, every time he would try to turn around and attack one of the lioness, she would back off the and other two would keep going at his backside. They had him running in circles. Also it was very loud, they were roaring a lot, he kept trying to roar at them.   


Well that went on for a minute or so, but at one point, I'm not sure what happened either the male lion lost his footing on the rock or the way one of the lioness hit him caused him to tumble over the side of the rock, into the part of the enclosure we couldn't see. Everyone around the enclosure, we all tried to run to the side to see, but the way the enclosure is set up you really just cannot see that small back corner.   


But we could definitely hear them roaring, then it just kinda slowly died off the roaring lessened, until I guess the lioness backed off and they just went back to chilling? Again, I simply could not see that side of the enclosure and I did not get to see the male lion again, but the lioness walked back in to the rest of the enclosure. The lion cubs that had gotten the fuck out when the fighting started crept back out and started just playing with their mom.  


Several zoo employees from different directions of the park came running past during the end of this too, and after another 5 minutes of just sitting there they called back the cubs and the mother and they went into the cages, so they were starting to pull all the lions out of the exhibit I guess. I believe they got the male lion out first but I didn't see him at all??

&#x200B;

 So idk, me and several other of the guests definitely saw blood on the lioness claws and face/mouth, so the male lion was definitely injured but I have no idea how bad. We guessed he was definitely going to need some medical attention though, I tried looking online when I got home but there is nothing (although in 2013 a male lion killed a female lion in the Dallas zoo so not the first time of violence I guess)

It was also constantly turning on and connecting to wifi basically everywhere. A feature that I had to turn wifi on for to disable the setting that caused this. Just why? My biggest gripe is that now closing multiple tabs/apps is the opposite of the way it used to be. It was left/right swipe for switching, and up/down for closing. Now ot's the opposite and I do the wrong one every time.

I hope those who can also relate take solace in knowing that this state of being is temporary and growth will happen. Let yourself heal and things can only improve üíï

_'Some periods of our growth are so confusing that we don‚Äôt even recognize that growth is happening. We may feel hostile or angry or weepy and hysterical, or we may feel depressed. It would never occur to us, unless we stumbled on a book or a person who explained to us, that we were in fact in the process of change, of actually becoming larger, spiritually, than we were before. Whenever we grow, we tend to feel it, as a young seed must feel the weight and inertia of the earth as it seeks to break out of its shell on its way to becoming a plant. Often the feeling is anything but pleasant. But what is most unpleasant is the not knowing what is happening. Those long periods when something inside ourselves seems to be waiting, holding its breath, unsure about what the next step should be, eventually become the periods we wait for, for it is in those periods that we realize that we are being prepared for the next phase of our life and that, in all probability, a new level of the personality is about to be revealed.'_ -Alice Walker"

Even worse, answering the phone kind of puts another burden on me to be the one who initiates the call sometimes. So I end up calling my friends out of a sense of duty even though I don't want to talk. How to resolve this: here are my options

1. Continue what the case is currently, set time aside to call them and somehow learn to enjoy it

2. Talk to them and explain how I don't like talking on the phone and resist coming off as cold and a bad friend who is too self centered to make the time to listen to his friend's concerns

For me, hell is being stuck in a guitar store forever. My dad has always been an avid hobbyist musician. When I was young, he used to bring me to the guitar store, probably hoping to interest me in learning to play music, but I was just a young kid with absolutely no interest in learning how to play an instrument or create music. He would talk to the staff at the store and try out like 20 guitars while I just walked around the store bored to death. In lots of stores there are interesting things to look at and touch or read while waiting on someone, but the guitar store just had guitars hanging on the wall you aren‚Äôt supposed to touch if you‚Äôre a kid and the accessories that might have garnered a passing moment of interest, like grip strengtheners, were all locked in a display case where you couldn‚Äôt idly interact with them.

Heaven, though, is dancing all night to a DJ just playing all of your favorite songs to dance to and everyone else in the club loves these songs and gets excited with you every time the DJ puts on your favorite track, which is all of them because it‚Äôs heaven. I also have unlimited stamina and the coordination and dance skills of my youth.

I hadn‚Äôt thought about this much until today, but I find it interesting that music is a big part of both heaven and hell to me. It made me want to hear from other people, so please tell me about your personal heaven and hell!"

We've always had video and their have been ""vloggers"" since people had hand held camera but the scale at which Youtube allows people to post their content means that a 100 years  from now people will be able to watch someone's entire life play out in a video series. And not just celebrity types of people but more or less ordinary everyday people. And then if you wanted to find out their opinions on a subject (let's say a very specific political event that occurred on a very specific day) you could find out exactly their thoughts and feelings by searching the date of the event on Youtube. So, Youtube is going to be a huge time capsule and likely best ever.

I do sometimes get this strange feeling when watching videos of Youtubers that have died. It's different than watching stuff from the 50s or even the 90s ( I was born in 99). The video isn't usually grainy so I feel more connected to it plus the fact that I loved during that time. It's also strange when watching those types of videos because you ultimately know what is going to happen to the person. For example if you've ever watched a vlog of someone who filmed their battle with cancer and succumbed to that ailment it can be heartbreaking because unlike the people who were experiencing it first hand, you know that x person is not going to survive despite all the pain. Regardless of whether you are religious or not, videos series like that I think offer a glimpse of what God would see  if He existed. Imagine knowing the future of ever single person you knew?"

They decided to come down on Christmas and spend a few days with us.

 I was just chilling post Xmas style and slowly getting ready to go out when a loud thumping came at my door. I heard a man's voice, calling me by my first name. I looked out the peephole and saw a huge man I did not recognise, standing there.

He was calling ""Is nobody home?!"" and cursing to himself in English (note: I live in a non English city). I had a bad feeling and just stayed schtum. Eventually he left but not before thumping a good while on the door. 

Going over the facts I can't figure out who he was. Dude has my first name and my address but not my phone number? That rules most people I know socially, as no one rang to say they'd be dropping in. It might not rule out a distant acquaintance from back before I changed my number some 2 years ago. 

So that rules out any of my actual friends. 

none of the neighbours know my first name which rules them out, too. 

if it'd been an official house call like a gas company reporting a leak they'd also have used my last name or stated the name of their business at the very least to justify the intrusion. 

That leaves basically no one.

who tf was this guy?!

Anyone ever heard of something like that happening? My head has been massively spun around. Is it a scam? What kind of scam even works that way?

Colour me confused.

that just happened 20 mins btw"

John, the upstairs neighbor, seemed to be getting out of his car at the same time. I greet him politely, wanting to just get home. Conversation continues into how crazy 2020 has been, but how the vaccine is around the corner. John begins spouting that the vaccine couldn‚Äôt be possible without Trump. Red flag. 

John continues on to reinforce his statement with ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù Keep in mind that I have never had a conversation with him, outside of introductions with his family. He, unsurprisingly, at the time didn‚Äôt really seem that friendly. Wonderful family, otherwise though. This marked conversation number two with John.

I politely listened to his side and tried to play the middle line. Perhaps Trump has done some good, but his twitter still proves his character otherwise. I prefer a leader that errs on the side of caution, which I specifically pointed out was my own personal opinion. Yes. As redundant as that last statement was, I felt the individual needed the clarification. 

He goes onto FSB(?);has a hard time recalling Trump‚Äôs policy that expedited the vaccine. I vaguely remember Pfizer has publicly stated that they have not accepted White House assistance, they put up their own seed money. But I also don‚Äôt follow politics that heavily, so I concede this to him with a ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs cool. That‚Äôs great if that‚Äôs true!‚Äù

I‚Äôm wondering why he chose to bring up politics on the first possible chance. I choose to be polite and try to play along and keep the conversation friendly. This is basically my first genuine conversation with the guy after all.  

He goes onto raving about Trump and how America has improved since Trump has taken presidency. I throw out some clear cut issues (his signalling, his initial response with covid) with Trump that I don‚Äôt agree with. John counters with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre only getting that because you‚Äôre watching leftist news channels.‚Äù (Huh? We‚Äôve had a 15 minute conversation with John monologuing most of it.) I state that I feel that Trump‚Äôs twitter really does need some explaining. He doesn‚Äôt have much to say about it, but goes onto say that the vaccine rush wouldn‚Äôt have been possible under Obama.  Adds on that Obama got lucky with SARS. (Fairly sure this was possible thanks to a pandemic response committee of some sort, wonder where that went.) I try to bring back the conversation back on topic of leadership qualities. We go back and forth a bit about how Trump isn‚Äôt supported at all these days and that Obama was loved by the media. (It got pretty wild, as he started throwing more and more defensive statements.)

What the hell have I walked right on Christmas? I figure; this conversation is already full steam, why not figure out if he‚Äôs at least reasonable? 
I ask him, ‚ÄúDo you feel like Obama had any positive qualities as president?‚Äù
A resounding ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anything you would concede as positive, regarding Obama?‚Äù Again, a resounding ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù 
I‚Äôm flabbergasted by his bratty, stubborn urge to completely side with Trump without genuinely being reasonable with the ‚Äúopposing‚Äù side. 

John continues on and spouts how Trump‚Äôs policies regarding covid and foreign affairs have been wrongly portrayed on the media. Goes onto say ‚ÄúI think you would really like and agree with his policies if you knew about them.‚Äù

At this point, I stop him, literally review the conversation up until this point (his car to my second floor apartment, 50 steps, max), and ask; ‚ÄúWhat is your purpose in initially bringing up Trump?‚Äù He sidesteps the question and goes into how the media has really messed up my perspective. 

Aloud; I review the time, the ridiculousness of this conversation and bid him a good night. 



It‚Äôs wonderful to know that age really does not define wisdom, or even an ability to keep societal boundaries. 

Regardless of political preferences, I hope everyone is able to at least remain reasonable in conversation. 
Remember, F.O.R.D. Not R.A.P.E.



Here‚Äôs to wonderful neighbors and ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù /s
Merry Christmas."

**It does not bother me at all** if it is a controversial subject or a opinionated post/comment.

But if I ask for help regarding something, why would anyone downvote that?

If i post something factual, why would anyone downvote that?

It's weird... it bugs me.

I wish that reddit made it so that either you yourself could see who upvoted and downvoted your posts/comments or so that everyone could see who downvoted and upvoted all posts/comments.

I mean we are already hiding behind the anonymity of a reddit username, which you can just create a new if you feel compromised, so why the need for secrecy regarding the votes? 


I wouldn't mind confronting people about why they downvoted some of my things, was it a missclick? are you having a bad day? did i hurt your feelings somehow? 

I'm so curious sometimes as to why people choose to downvote.


Lol I sometimes even upvote posts/comments that I don't necessarily have any strong feelings towards or agree with, only because they are at 0 and I felt that there was no reason for anyone downvote it.


Like if someone posts ""what is your favorite soda"" and someone responds ""Dr.Pepper"" and it has 0 points, I would upvote that, because, why would anyone even downvote something like that?

But yeah, It's weird that I even care about any of these things.

In the end it's just numbers on a screen, I have multiple accounts so I'm not harvesting points or anything, I just feel like it's an injustice towards people to downvote, since it's a way of disagreeing with them, even though often it is about something that you can't really ""disagree"" with."

Thank you, for worrying about the situation in the first place, and thank you for reflecting about your individual possibilities. Thank you for considering all those pleople who you potentially saved by not travelling (I know this sounds dramatic but think about it). Thank you for sacrifice, I know how hard it is to be alone, especially during holidays. 

In my case, I already booked flights and packed eberything but decided to stay last minute. All of my friends went to see their families, because they were less in risk of spreding the virus than I was. And I despite I am sad to be alone right now, I am genuinely happy about every post I see about other people in the same situation, because that shows me how many still take the pandemic seriously and try their best to do their part in fighting covid. Not everyone can play a big role like doctors and nurses. The only thing that most of us can do right now is to stay at home, and this is now more difficult than ever.

Guys, you are great! Thank you, whereever you are! And to all others: enjoy your families on our behalf :)"

I joined this group of poplar kids + my crush, they are all good dancers. I was pretty respected by the popular kids so I was welcomed in their group to dance.

Im a pretty awful dancer but I was fine if it was just jumping, singing, and doing simple hand movements.
Well the DJ changed the music to an up beat song with many drops. Likewise, our dance group also changed our dynamic that every end of a drop 1 must solo dance in the center of the group circle. We are 30 something in our group and a couple hundred total in the dance floor. The music was only too long so the solo dancers are just the top dancers(my crush included) and me at the last as 'testing' rite.

Well fuck I can only do cringey jumping shuffle.

So I decided to join a room for music and after listening to others perform, I got the guts to join the queue to go up on stage and sing something. Eventually I went from singing over the regular music, to singing along to a karaoke track, to full on singing acapella when I couldn‚Äôt find the proper backing track to the song I wanted. The more I got up on stage, the more I worked up my confidence in my abilities as I heard the virtual cheers. 

When I finally had to say goodnight the mod for the server actually said to me how nice it was to hear me sing. Maybe after covid I‚Äôll have the courage to go to a real irl open mic night!"

And so I entered the house, finished dinner,  and took a shower, and then one of my friends started spamming me telling me to go to the front of the house. And I see a gift there. So I unwrap it and such and its full of snacked etc. My fav foods etc. And so I'm like ""oh my gosh, thank you so much, but whats up with the gift? 0w0"" cause she had already gifted me a gift earlier due to Corona. And she was like ""I mentioned to my parents about ur bad day and they decided to go buy you some stuff to cheer u up"" 
AND WHEN I SAY MY HEART MELTED, IT DID! I honestly never knew how much her parents viewed me as extended family so rn, I'm all cheery and warm and fuzzy and happy. I actually can't contain my joy rn. So yeah xD the end of story. I just felt like I wanted to express this.

And if there is no more nails, I'll eat the skin around it until it bleeds and it'll be super painful and uncomfortable. I just can't stop myself. It's like a drug.

I now really wanted to know how it feels to have longer nails. So I asked my sister to put some nail polish in my fingers. I know it doesn't really work because when I were younger, I tried that bitter clear nail polish and I will just peel it off with my teeth and do it again.

But now I didn't wanted to let it down, I took the darkest nail polish and I said to myself ""bite a nail and you're a coward, if you can't do this, you can't do anything.""
And my god, I am truly happy I did this.

I never had nails that long, I still fiddle with my nails, but never bite them (some of them but nothing like before) and I truly feel like I have prettier hands.

Before, I would always hide my hands, which is a shame because I have some good looking hands (pianist hands as they call haha). My nails were the only problems and they were a huge problems.
They are not like 1cm long, but my god I feel better about them.

My father would always say some terrible stuff like ""you look like a leprous"" and that was obviously not the best thing, so I really feel like a glowed up.

It's still not perfect, I don't think I will ever be able to completely stop it, but I do think I will do my best to not bite it, and I want those buddies to grow as long as they can.

It's a really small thing, but I'm happy to see that my life-long stress is losing little by little

When I was young, probably no older than 4, Mom took Big Sister (s) (age 6) and I to a bike store and we picked out a great bike for Dad for Christmas. Mom told us we had to keep it a secret. She hid the bike at the neighbors to the right‚Äôs house. 

Not long after that, Dad took S and I to the exact same bike shop, and we picked out a bright red bike for Mom, for Christmas. He told us we had to keep it a secret. He hid the bike at the neighbor across the street‚Äôs house.

On Christmas Eve, S and I leaped out of bed in the middle of the night to go look at the tree. There were bikes out there! We giggled at the big surprise, and went back to sleep, waiting until we were allowed wake up and open all the presents. 

When we were allowed to get up, we raced out to the living room to see that the bikes we'd seen in the middle of the night were, in fact, super duper awesome pink BMX bikes (it‚Äôs as the 80s) for S and me. We got bikes! Mom snuck out of the room and went and got Dad's shiny black new bike, and he started to laugh. He went and got her bright red bike. Everyone got bikes that year! 

The amazing thing, to me, is that S and I managed to go to the same bike shop twice, and keep the bike secret from both of our parents, for weeks! And that our parents decided to get us bikes, but didn't slip that they also got each other bikes. 

So that's the story of the year of the bikes. My favorite Christmas memory."
