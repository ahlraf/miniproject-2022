If I’m suffering from this awfulness, why can’t their be one upside of losing weight? I obviously binge more than I’m capable of purging and I have no motivation or energy to workout.

The past couple weeks I haven’t really been able to binge because I have no money, no more credit. It honestly was nice not to even have the option, but stressful. 
Anyways, today I ordered food three times, ate three big meals, and purged it all up after each time. I’m so sick of binging, I don’t even enjoy it anymore, in fact the purging was more memorable because at least I felt something. 
I feel gross, but better than I’d feel if I didn’t purge. 
I left the bathroom after the final purge, and before I did, I said to myself, when I leave the bathroom, this is over. 
Going into the new year I really hope it is.
I’m drained, I’m basically going to be homeless soon(living in a van), with a very tight budget. I’m afraid I won’t be able to get out of debt, I’m so sick of the cycle. 
Does anyone else’s ED cause significant financial strain?"
kneeb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/kneeb2/does_anyone_else_break_down_when_they_cant_binge/,Does anyone else break down when they can’t binge and purge for a long time?,4,3,1609373567.0,"I live with my parents, but normally stay with my boyfriend where I can binge and purge without judgment (he knows I am in the very long process of recovery as a 10-year bulimic). Because of the holidays, his family has been home so I haven’t been able to stay there, thus meaning I haven’t been able to binge and purge hardly at all. In the past week, I have only binged and purged once. On a normal day-to-day basis, I would usually binge and purge 1 to 3 times a day at LEAST. It really helped me cope, especially right now after surviving a suicide attempt this past summer. It was the only thing I had to help me get through these painful months. 

I am in therapy, and my therapist and I are working together to find me an ED specialist. In the meantime, she has been telling me that if engaging in eating disorder behaviours is keeping me alive right now, then that’s okay. And it truly is. My bulimia has been the one thing keeping me sane these past 7 months. Of course I recognize that bulimia itself is putting my life at risk too, but if it stops me from committing suicide then that is all I can do right now until I get help from a specialist and/or eating disorder facility.

Not being able to binge and purge every day has sent me into a downhill spiral I did not anticipate. I’ve been having more panic attacks than I’ve ever had in my life, and have been crying hysterically daily. I haven’t self harmed in around 2 months, but it’s getting to the point where I feel a relapse coming on soon. I’m unbearably suicidal and all I want is that release from purging, but I physically can’t since I have no where to do it privately. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like I am going insane. I have dealt with drug addiction in the past, and these withdrawals are so much worse than any drug withdrawal I ever experienced. I seriously dream about binging and purging. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I have no control anymore and I don’t want to be alive. If any of you can even simply relate to this, that would mean so much to me. I feel so alone and so lost right now."

Went to the kitchen and started munching on a salad. Literally NOTHING in the fridge looked good. And my salad was subpar. And yet I still decided to binge just so I could purge. I don’t usually BP during the day because I’m either at school or work or asleep. Most of the time I don’t even eat until 7pm or later. So it doesn’t matter that much. 

I just started making things. Different foods so I could graze. Noodles, pizza, I asked my brother to bring me home chicken nuggets, etc. And none of it is even good. It’s all really subpar tasting. And I don’t even know why I felt the need to BP. 

I feel really f’cking garbage right now. Everything kinda hurts, and I’m bloated and full and haven’t purged yet, nor do I want to. I’m tired. 

I hate when this happens it’s like I don’t even eat anymore to live. It’s just so I can purge. 

Thanks for letting me vent."

kmvff0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/kmvff0/removed_myself_from_aa_subreddit_because_it_was/,Removed myself from AA subreddit because it was triggering,30,9,1609304226.0,"The other morning I posted that I relapsed with purging & my alcoholism the day after Christmas. I posted on both this page & the AA subreddit page.
I mainly posted in the AA page because physical AA meetings are scarce right now because of Covid, so I thought I’d share there as an “in the moment” type situation.
One thing that I have learned while being apart of these support groups (in all my life) is that these addictions/disorders/diseases we have, are obviously detrimental to our mental/emotional/physical health. But apart of the recovery process comes the possibility (very strong possibility) of relapsing. Since nobody is perfect & wakes up “cured” from their addictions over night.
When I posted that “relapse is apart of recovery” on the AA page, I was met with several responses telling me that I was wrong & that relapse is not apart of the process nor should we look at it as such. Because it “reiterates the idea that a relapse is okay, when it’s not.”
When I disagreed, I still got responses stating how wrong I was & that my relapse makes me more of a failure than anything else, & that if I were “serious” about sobriety then I wouldn’t have relapsed.
I didn’t respond after that. Instead I removed myself from the page & deleted my post all together. For a moment it actually sent me spiraling thinking maybe I was a failure & that I need to feel guilty. I cried actually lol.
On the other hand, the responses I got from this bulimia page was OVERWHELMING incredible. So much fucking support. So much love. You guys don’t even know me yet y’all kept telling me how proud y’all were that I had 16 days purge free. If it weren’t for this page, I would have come home the other day & drank myself to sleep or binged until I was too full & then purged it all. I am absolutely not fucking lying about that. If it weren’t for the amount of support I get from those who struggle with eating disorders, I literally don’t know if I’d be alive today. 
So thank you ❤️
Side note, I have my physical support groups, but I use Reddit as a way of meeting new people & reading stories, connecting, helping, taking advice, etc. I don’t rely fully on Reddit as my main source of support, but I just wanted to say that the ED community in particular, has always been full of the best fucking people. 
You guys are all incredible. If you’re struggling in recovery right now, you can pull through. I believe in you. NEVER FEEL LIKE A FAILURE. Take it one day at a time, one meal at a time. You/we/I can do this ❤️❤️❤️ I’m 2 days in recovery right now & I’m determined to go further this time. 
With all of this being said, feel free to respond & tell me your thoughts or even just your recovery stories. I’ve decided to spend less time on Reddit until I feel comfortable enough again lol. But I’d love to hear everyone’s recovery stories ❤️❤️❤️"

kmml3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/kmml3i/my_experience_with_bulimia_nervosa_depression_and/,"My experience with bulimia nervosa, depression and apathetic feelings.",5,1,1609274829.0,"It's yet another sleepless night for me. A night where not only the eating disorder, but also the numerous ocean of thoughts is keeping me awake. I've figured, since I did something similar towards a large groups of friends a few days ago, that I'd share my stories with some fellow teenagers, who might be encouraged by my story and words. There's nothing more beautiful than helping others with your own actions or words. I'm technically not a teenager anymore since I've already turned 20 this year, so let's just pretend you didn't see that. 

My name is Aaron. I've been suffering from an eating disorder called bulimia nervosa for about two and a half years now. It has probably been even longer than that but you're not really keeping an eye in the beginning on what you're doing because you don't consider it as a problem, rather a temporary solution for all of your problems. I'm currently in a really critical body condition. I was told by my doctor that my kind can die from organ failure, suicide or total collapsing of the body in general, which isn't really uncommon. He even said that you don't have to be underweight for such consequences and well, sadly I am that. 

I just recently started to open myself up about the bulimia because I realized a few months ago that the never ending cycle of binging and purging, that is happening on a daily basis, is slowly killing me and everything except a healthy solution. If I hadn't opened up the nobody would have known what was wrong with me because it was always rather easy to hide it and putting on a facade so no suspicion would be drawn on me. The weight loss was excused with my excessive Gym sessions. I strived for an utopian goal of achieving an, in hindsight, unhealthy weight of so called ""perfection"" that would grant me the feeling of happiness and accomplishment but boy was I wrong. I started to eat less and less and if there was something that I had to eat to not ring any bells or to break free of this cycle then that interfered with my distorted reality of becoming ""perfect"", so I confronted it with hugging the toilet bowl. The mind and body are two separate parties which should cooperate but can also be in war with themselves while you are in the middle of the warfare. Eventually the body will automatically react to the restrictions you've put on yourself so you start binging in order to get the nutritions your body had been missing all the time you did stupid things like a low carb diet or eating once a day. The fear of becoming ""fat"" that your scarred mind projects is greater than anything else so you're met with facing the toilet bowl once again. Day for day. Week for week. Year for year. The puking continues to damage your entire body while you're being blinded by countless thoughts, such as the feeling of not being good enough when you gain a little more weight or the general feeling of being rejected when you become fat again. Your mind is foggy and all you can think about is the next meal. After every b/p session (binge and purge) you feel worthless, hopeless, full of shame and self hatred but you cling to a yet another empty promise that tomorrow you'll have gotten a hold of yourself and end it once in for all. That you won't be controlled by this disease like a marionette but as easy, as the post b/p clarity is trying to make it sound, it stays wishful thinking. Mental illnesses often have their roots in deeper reasoning than an eating disorder might seem. Why I shove food into my mouth until I'm full to the brim and then purge it all out is a riddle for myself but I'm not really in a stable state of mind to make any logical deductions. 

A broken leg can be easily spotted but a broken heart can't be seen so easily unless the one with it opens up. For years I put myself to the side in order to help others because I knew how painful loneliness, despair and the feeling of not being good enough felt and that's something I wouldn't want anyone else to feel. Now I have to carry our the fruits of my labor but I honestly don't regret a single second of it. I've helped many people, brang their smile and was there for them when no one else was. But the one person that would have needed me the most did I neglect; myself. Today I struggle with getting out of bed and doing simple every tasks. Melancholic and depressing feelings are my daily bread as well as feeling weak and almost losing your conscious. You're constantly questioning everything while simultaneously feeling worthless. Even though you know you have accomplished so much this far, nothing positive reaches you anymore. Not from authorities, supervisors, friends or anyone else. I have a grand friend circle and I'm mostly seen as an extroverted and empathetic person who has no issues meeting new people and befriending them but nowadays I often make up mistakes to not see anyone of my friends. I've been aware for a long time that that is not normal but these apathetic feelings, that are present every single second of the day, don't help at all. I've become an emotional shipwreck whose future looks like nothing but foggy thoughts and helplessness. I'm fully aware that it is not normal and that somewhere the line has to be drawn. This disease is slowly killing me and the two parties in my body are acting bipolar towards the idea of keeping on to your dreams and throwing the towel on a 5 minute basis. It's not normal for a 20 year old to feel like this and I'm fully aware of that. It's absolutely not normal that I shiver constantly after a meal and then begin to purge because I succumb to this disease or that my arms have to pull tight to the shopping cart because legs won't obey me anymore. The symptoms like constant shivering, freezing and only having food on your mind while having extreme mood swings are agonizing and painful, yet you feel as if you're not able to do anything. It is there where I had to draw the line. After seeing a few therapist and psychologists I realized that an ambulatory treatment isn't going to do it for me. I didn't want to give in at first because I've gone through so much already without any family backing me up but a person can only withstand so much until even the sturdiest shell begins to fall apart. Sometimes you have to face the truth and give in in order to help yourself. Sometimes it is neccessary to seek for help because that's what others like professionals are there for. It's hard to admit that you can't do everything by yourself. I myself was met with empty promises by my family again and again and after being disappointed over and over again I began to do everything on my own until I got my apartment at the age of 17 which was almost 4 years ago. Only a a couple of years ago have I realized that not every person is filled with malicious and selfish intents but now my shell, which was formed from the disappointments and hate from my past, stands in my way and prevents me from enjoying the life. I have dreams like getting a job that suits me and that I gladly wake up to every morning or forming my own little family and giving us a good an enjoyable and wonderful life because now I'd be in charge as a parent and give my wife and children the life that was taken from me while simultaneously treating myself as well. I want to enjoy the life in its fullest form again so that compliments and words from those who have a place in my heart can reach me again. Now it seems like unreachable dreams for me and I know that something has to changed. 

I'm due for a clinical treatment, which is going to take place on the 4th of January for a 12 week period. I know it is going to be hard but there's no other way around. Either I accept this clinical treatment or I'm slowly going to get killed by the bulimia. 

I want to encourage everyone who's struggling with themselves and can't find the motivation to open up. I know getting hurt is the most awful thing but you have to remember at what cost you're doing it. I'm so happy and thankful for all the friends I have behind my back who have been constantly kicking my butt and help me as much as they can after I had opened up to them about two months ago. I had a very early adolescence due to familial circumstances so I began to  self reflect everything that I do, say and encounter pretty early. I can be happy about opening up only after two years because I was told by people like my kind that they hadn't opened up for over 20 years until they landed in the hospital. I don't want that, I'm not fully ready to die always and neither should anyone of you feel like that as well. No one should feel lonely or worthless and I can only sit here, hoping that I was able to reach anyone with these words. 

None of you are alone, I promise you that. Opening up may come with the cost of being hurt but it is for your own sake and throwing away your life isn't worth it. You can't chase after your dreams when you're not here anymore. There's so much to the life that's worth seeing and experiencing and I don't want to give up just yet, I can't, even if one part of my body is keep telling me to give up already. There's only one life and one chance only. What is gone can't be replaced and I can't be more thankful for my friends who showed me that it's not worth to give up. I know that sadly not everyone has the privilege of friends and people by their side who they can open up to but let me reinforce once again that you're NOT alone and that there's always someone willing to listen to you. If you feel like there's isn't, then I'll always be there. I do admit that I'm scared and frightened by the upcoming treatment but as stated earlier, I don't want to let this disease overtake everything. Humans should help each other and be there for them so nobody has to feel alone or helpless. All of you are perfect the way you are and no one can take away the uniqueness that was given to you, don't ever forget that! 

Stay safe and take care not only of your friends but also your friends. I wish everyone who has similar problems or experiences only the best and know that I'll always be there if needed, I promise that. Take it for granted, please. Thank you for reading this. If you have anything to say, say it. Discussing is always a nice distraction from these rather depressing times and situation. 

I'll be hitting the hay now, it's already passed 3 am. Goodnight fellas. 

Thank you very much,

Aaron"

Hi! I don’t know if this will be visible for a lot of people (new on reddit) but i thought i’d give it a shot because it’s kinda important for me

I’m currently a senior in Belgium and for an important school project, my group and i are looking for someone (between 16-18 years old, no specific gender) who currently has or had the eating disorder Bulimia. We’d like to ask a few questions (completely anonymously!) through DMs/messages on here. Our goal with this kind of interview is to understand the amount of struggles, experiences, etc... bulimic people go through on a daily basis. 

My group will send a list of questions and you can totally choose which questions you do not want to answer if it’s too personal for you. Your answers will be translated to Dutch (i’m a student in a flemish speaking school) by me since i’m the only person that’s fluent in English in my group. 

If you would like to help us out for this but don’t want to comment under this post, feel free to message me on here. 

Hope u all have a nice day!🤍"

During the spring I developed bulimia, moved in with my ex partner, and went through a break up. One of the leading causes that relationship didn’t work was due to my disorder. There were nights my ex would beg me to love myself. He couldn’t continue watching the person he loved slowly self-destruct. 


Anyways, something I swore off is now part of a near daily routine. I hate it. I have never felt so disconnected from the reflection I see in the mirror. My body aches. I have never felt so lonely. 

My ed morphs me into a person I hate. I push the ones I love away, isolate, fill hours of my day with reading toxic ed-based boards or watch Mukbangs to mask the extreme hunger. 

Recovery is all I want, yet I can’t seem to find that extra (inner) push to commit. Even after losing arguably the best lover I’ve had. I just don’t care. 

So, the cycle continues.

Anyways, my Ubereats should be arriving soon. I don’t want to give up. But for now I guess I’ll give into these selfish urges."

Some days I’ll purge 3+ times a day, but most days now it’s 1-2 times because I wait to eat until the evening which is when I have my BP cycle. 

I dunno. It’s frustrating because lately, I just BP at night. I don’t even eat until in the evening. Most of the time I can restrict until 4pm or later, wait to eat until I’m at home (usually between 8pm-10pm) where I can binge and then purge. Honestly, these days I just binge eat specifically so I can purge. I’m not even hungry and my body hurts most of the time. 
But anyways, lately I’ll purge and I’ll feel “good” afterwards. (In a sense). But then a few hours later I’m grazing again and just eating everything which completely ruins my purge. By then I’m too physically broken down since I’m battling other health issues, and therefore it’s like I wasted a BP cycle AND fucked up by eating again. 

I don’t know how to stop this cycle either. It’s like I’m not even hungry, but I feel the *need* to eat something and everything and I always feel disgusting and disappointed after. Usually I end up taking laxatives to at least sort of help and that ends up being a whole mess the next day. 

Idk. Mostly a vent. A little bit of me seeking for advice. A lot of just a DAE post."

I was probably 12-13 and somewhat overweight, adding family pressure surrounding the topic just feed into the desire to thin up, u kno. However today, at 17, the purging/binging cycle is routine for me. Doesn’t need to happen everyday, sometimes months of rest, depending on distractions and life in general. The point of it is not to lose weight either but rather a habit of some sort, even regulation if you must put a term for it. Realistically, of course I am scared of gaining, it is ingrained in me now that weight is an important matter surrounding worth in the eye of others. However, I eat normal amounts, and purge when I eat to much, to prevent gain. 

Coming to the point, I haven’t tried once to quit because I don’t see an issue with it. But yeah rationally I know that it’s unhealthy, mentally and physically, but how do one stop after so long?"

km0j50,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/km0j50/low_appetite_bulimia/,Low appetite bulimia?,10,1,1609194244.0,"My bulimia started as many do, after a period of heavy restriction. 
For a few months now I've completely let go and allowed myself to eat at liberty. Of course this lead to plenty of hunger driven binges, but I put my trust in the process, hoping that eventually my hunger would self regulate... and it did!

But recently, none of my binges have started out of appetite or hunger or even a craving... Most of the time my appetite is -low-. Especially in the mornings I sit around wondering what the hell to eat because nothing sounds good.
But then later in the day, even when I've had a hearty breakfast, I eat a small snack and then just... won't stop. I have no desire to continue and I'm not going for ""forbidden"" foods. Most of the time I binge on plain stuff (dry crackers, oatmeal, slices of rye bread, fruits) until my stomach hurts so bad I have to purge for sheer relief, not guilt.

I'm just completely at a loss at what I could be doing wrong, or do differently. I keep telling my body it's okay, you're no longer in a famine, and you can eat what you crave... but it doesn't stop the binges. Has it just become a bad habit? What techniques can I employ? Mindfulness, self forgiveness and giving up restriction haven't helped."

I told him about my history with bulimia; how I had started at 16, and relapsed at 21 and then once again at 28. I am constantly battling myself when it comes to food. I have no idea how to eat properly anymore...I’ll always feel guilt when I eat something fattening and I will always feel depressed about my weight. I am overweight on the BMI scale and when I met my bf I was at one of my skinniest weight (I’m 5’4 and weigh 75kg currently. When we met I was 68-69kg, my lowest ever was when I was 16 at 62kg). I started to gain a bit earlier this year but I started to eat better and avoid throwing up. He knows about my bulimia from early on in our relationship so when I started to exercise and count calories, he was glad I wasn’t throwing up. But then I started to only eat 400-500 calories a day and when he knew he was upset. He said starving myself isn’t good. He said that it doesn’t work and my body will think there’s a famine or war and it will cling to every fat there is. I got a job in April after that and it was a night shift job so I had to stay up all night til morning. I was eating like absolute shit at this point. I put on weight to like 71kg. This upset me but I was always so exhausted and getting sick all the time due to the night shift (I’m also diabetic so I’m almost always exhausted). Then at the urging of my boyfriend and how I genuinely felt about the job, I quit in October. I haven’t been working since and I’ve put on a lot of weight. Now I’m at 75kg!!! My boyfriend told me that he loves me very much but he likes slim girls. He’s always liked slim girls...He didn’t say it like this though. His exact words were “I love you soooo much but like...”. At my urging he told me that “he has standards”. And I guess everyone has standards. His is just that he likes slim girls. 

Thing is, I also hate my body. I wish I was skinnier. I wish my thighs didn’t rub together. I wished I didn’t have a huge gut that stuck out. I hate my body so much...I have been trying to lose weight as much as possible but just can’t seem to get it to stick. I hate working out... I just absolutely despise it even when I was losing weight, I never felt good or happy about doing it. The whole endorphins make you happy thing never happened to me. I also try not to count calories anymore because I felt so strict when I did it and always starved myself or if I didn’t, I’d go over the count and feel really depressed. All I keep thinking of rn is relapsing. I just wished I could relapse again but I can’t be my boyfriend told me he’d break up with me if I did. He said he wouldn’t be able to live with it, just allowing me to throw up after eating when he loves me. He has all this faith in me, that I’d do it the right way and lose weight but I just don’t. I’m 30 and I used to be a very skinny kid until I started to grow boobs at 10 and BALLOONED in weight. I have never ever been able to really keep my weight down after I was 10. I’d lose weight here and there and then, just nothing. Weight would come off and then get right back on. Nothing was sustainable. I’ve tried all kinds of diets. Nothing sticks. 20 years of failure and he said that it doesn’t even matter because once you change you change. Idk why man, I just get so pissed when I hear him speak like a motivational coach, being all positive and believing in me and trying to tell me how it’s done...It makes me rage so hard...

Tonight, we had a HUGE argument about this, where I almost begged him to just let me throw up. He refused to and again said that he cannot stay with me if I did. He also feels like it is his fault if I relapsed, to which I say that it isn’t. It’s just mine because I’m the one that did it. He is really upset with me rn and he won’t really talk to me. I just don’t know what to do."

I am going to start the binge by eating a bunch of fruit first and then move on to the more calorie-dense foods, but I’m still terrified of gaining weight from this binge.

This isolation is not doing me any good and even if I were able to see someone, I wouldn't because I'm so ashamed of what I look like now. I'm struggling and I am too afraid to reach out to my friends. They wouldn't understand, nor have they understood, ever. In their opinion, I'm not thin anymore so I cannot possibly be struggling.

That's the opposite of the truth. I am not purging and therefore I hate myself more and more, every single day. I am no longer using these behaviors and I'm trying to stop abusing alcohol so I've turned to physical self-harm. I am not using drugs anymore either, so my days are filled with gaming, self-loathing and studying (finals in January).  I don't know what to and I cannot believe that I am here again.

But now that I find myself sitting and eating Christmas dinner with my family, forcing myself to stop at a normal portion size of food, I think I really do have a problem. It's ABNORMAL for my body to eat a normal portion of food. I'm not used to it anymore. I'm semi panicking. I'm not in control and I'm just realizing that. I've never been in control. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to stop. That's to frightening. I enjoy purging. It gives me a light headed high. I feels comforting. I think I like it more then the food itself.

It's not Christmas without at least one purge. I have been struggling with bulimia since I was 15. I am 24 now. Naturally, it's been on and off through the years and last year and the beginning of this year was going really well. I was staying away from trigger foods, I tried to be less critical of myself etc. And then during the 4th month of lockdown everything just went to shit and it's been a struggle again ever since. Any holiday or festive season is triggering for me but nothing compares to Christmas. It's literally just like a whole binge fest. Everyone binges but they don't necessarily purge. They say they feel like shit afterwards but do they really though? Do they really hate themselves so much afterwards that they have to lock themselves in the fucking bathroom hoping to god no one walks in or knocks or hears. Every year I promise myself that I will be able to just have a fun day. Be normal, have a ""cheat day"", one day won't make a difference, you won't hate yourself this time. And every year I can't stop and every year I end up locked in the bathroom. I know it's just once a year but it fucking kills me that I can't just enjoy it like the rest of my family. Is that pathetic? Am I that selfish? To want to have one Christmas where I don't end up with a sore throat and swollen glands, one Christmas where I can be genuinely happy... Am I the only one that feels this way?

Hi everyone,
Unfortunately over the last 4 months or so I’ve developed a habit of restricting and purging, I don’t exactly know how I would categorise myself in terms of diagnosis, other than I know I’m not underweight, and my counsellor tells me that I have an eating disorder. I really struggle with feelings of guilt and this plays a massive part in me restricting and purging food.

Anyway, it’s been very difficult over the Christmas period as I’m sure it is for most people on here, and it’s been even harder to hide my habits from my parents. But my mum has been trying to lose weight with my stepdad (they are both overweight). I don’t know whether she’s projecting or whatever but it seems that very often now she will make comments about how “all I eat is junk food” and “your problem is that you eat too much junk and not enough real food” and “we all know you’re a secret eater, you eat sweets and chocolate when we’re not around” and then when I expressed my desire to lose weight she said “well maybe you would if you cut out all the junk food”. 

The straw that broke the camels back however was today, it’s Christmastime so obviously my family have been indulging and my mum made a comment about how my stepdad never eats fruit or veg, and I said to her to give him a break because it’s Christmas. She replied with “well you’re just as bad, in fact your eating habits are worse! You just eat junk”. Every time she makes these comments it just makes me either restrict or purge whatever I’ve eaten that day. I don’t even think she noticed I’ve lost a significant amount of weight since we last saw each other. I just don’t really know what to do about it, it’s really upsetting me."

I’m actually a recovering alcoholic also, so I relapsed with that first, with no intention of purging. 
Drank a little too much & thought purging would help make me less drunk (I regretted it the moment the alcohol hit my system lol so I figured I could lessen the drunkness if I purge)
Then I had food, & purged again.

I don’t regret relapsing with alcohol & purging. Only because I know relapse is apart of recovery so it happens. I mostly regret the alcohol aspect of it.
The last few days have been tough & purging was literally the last thing on my mind, whereas alcohol was the first.
When I purged hours ago, it wasn’t something I planned to do. I just did it. (I also didn’t do it thinking I want to be skinny, like I normally would. I did it because I didn’t want to be super drunk)

Anyway. I made it 16 days & I literally am beyond proud of myself. When I purge relapsed one year ago, I went this entire year purging every single day. The last 16 days have been everything I could have imagined when it comes to recovery. & I’m excited to start my clock over with it.

Good luck on your recovery!"

I am so heartbroken for him, and looking back I should’ve known and trusted what I heard. How can I help him? I’m at a loss. He just started therapy a few weeks ago for anxiety and he told me tonight as well that he is speaking with his therapist about this.

I have been purging everything I eat for about the past 6-8 months & most of what I eat for about another year prior to that. I ate one serving of chocolate before bed without purging & I have been sooo bloated & swollen legs. Like, not even gonna try the scale because I know the water weight is just insane. 

I tried to eat just a few cucumbers & hummus and a handful of Chex mix today (it was literally not a lot at all) and I felt so full and awful and it kept feeling worse for hours after, even with doses of mylanta antacid/anti gas, I ended up purging 6 hours after I ate and it all came up. 

I don’t know how I’m going to do this. I don’t know how I can recover. I reached out to my doctor months ago and asked for referrals, & they just threw me antidepressants & threatened hospitalization if I did gain weight (I haven’t); that hasn’t helped. I should at least try to go in for more lab work. It’s my resolution to stop purging & I want to make a valiant effort at recovery but I just don’t know how to move forward in a positive manner if I can’t even eat a snack without purging."

I’m completely mortified and hate myself so much. I don’t want to recover anymore.",6,4,1609038947.0,"*TW: Mentions numbers, weight loss, bulimia, restriction, laxative abuse, etc. I do not encourage ANY eating disorder behaviours.*

Since July this year, I have lost 115 pounds. I know this may sound vain, but one of the things I was most excited for on Christmas Day was to open new clothes and see size M or L on the tag instead of the usual 1X. I was very overweight for a long period of time due to severe depression, so when I lost all of this weight in 5 months, it was a huge accomplishment for me.

Yesterday, my boyfriend’s mom (who I see every day) gifted me pajamas. I opened the box and was completely mortified to see size 2X pajamas. I held them up and they look like ginormous clown pants that would have been far too big for me even at my heaviest weight. I said thank you and told her I love them of course, but later that night I cried and felt so horrible about myself. I have been struggling with bulimia for 10 years, and relapsed very badly this summer. I also began restricting and abusing laxatives in July which is when I started to lose all the weight. My eating disorder is at its worst and it is truly living hell.

The worst part of all of this is that for the first time in 7 months, I decided to let myself enjoy one day and to eat food without purging. Because it was Christmas, I ate a normal portion of Christmas dinner and did not purge. This was huge for me and I truly felt so proud of myself. It was the first time I haven’t purged a meal since May this year.

After receiving the size 2X pajamas, the guilt from eating set in and I felt the worst I’ve felt in months. I feel completely humiliated and embarrassed to be alive. I’m holding up the pajama pants right now and they are humongous. They wouldn’t even fit someone who weighs 350 pounds. The top is giant too. All I can think right now is, “Does my boyfriend’s mom really think I’m this big? I must look huge to her if she bought me these pajamas.” She also purchased them from her workplace, so she could have easily exchanged them for a smaller size or returned them if she bought them a while ago when I was 115 pounds heavier. Either way, never in my 6 years of knowing her has she given me clothing that’s a size 2X, even when I *was* very overweight...

I am not okay right now. I’m never going to let myself eat a meal without purging again. I need to be smaller. I hate myself so much."

But my body is deteriorating so fast that I fear I won’t be alive much longer if I don’t figure something out and soon. For starters; I’ve been struggling with bulimia for the last six years. It started when I was fourteen. I was a very overweight child. Very, very overweight. At my heaviest, I was nearly 300 pounds. The added depression and anxiety that comes with that certainly played a role in my developing of an ED. I was always a binge eater. I would eat ungodly amounts of food and feel awful, letting it sit in my stomach like a rock while I laid in bed and tried to fall asleep. Sad to say my eating habits haven’t changed, only now I purge along with the binges. It started out innocent enough, cramming a few fingers down my throat whenever I felt I ate too much. It slowly but surely progressed to a need to vomit up everything that went inside me once I noticed how fast I could lost weight this way. Problem is, my body got used to this, and now I cannot for the life of me keep any food down at all. I’ve spent the last two years throwing up anything that goes inside me. Another huge problem is that I no longer have to use my fingers. I can just flex my stomach muscles and it all comes out. This, sadly, makes it too easy to purge, and I do it wherever I can no matter what I eat. When I do try to keep food down, it’s the most horrible sensation imaginable. My stomach is in excruciating pain and my heart feels like it’s beating out of my chest. The only thing keeping me alive is Gatorade. I drink 4 or 5 bottles a day. I do not fear gaining weight, and around a year ago I was trying desperately hard to gain some. I was going to the gym every day and eating small things like protein bars and keeping them down. Then COVID happened and I ruined myself again. Weight has nothing to do with my ED; food just makes me feel like I’m dying so I have to get rid of it somehow. I poop maybe twice a week. I have very weird food phobias too which doesn’t help. I’m terrified of caffeine; the damage I’ve done to my heart has made any caffeine intake make me feel like I’m having a heart attack. A few months ago I drank half a can of soda and spent the next few hours driving around barely able to focus while my heart felt like it was going to explode. I legitimately wanted to go to the hospital. Doesn’t help that similar symptoms come from eating in general (rapid heartbeat, anxiety), so I’m always terrified that what I ate contained caffeine because of this and purge completely, chugging water over and over and throwing it up until it’s clear. I do not know what to do. New Years is coming up, and I’m definitely ready to commit to recovery. There are no treatment centers within hundreds of miles of me, and even if there were I don’t have insurance; even my university would charge me the same amount of not more than one of these places. So I don’t even know where to begin. If anyone made it this far, thank you for caring. If you have any advice, please please give it to me. You could be saving my life."

I am pretty lean so losing a kilo is not little.

What I am saying is when ur scared of gaining weight while eating normal - chances are you maintain is or even lose some when you quite. I know it’s not that easy but if that’s the only thing holding you back, try it! 5 days - even if you gain weight it’s probably just water ;)"

Nothing went wrong or anything but I restricted for a few days prior so I would have room for Christmas but I decided not to sabotage my fast so Ive had 0 calories since Wednesday (96+ hrs) fueled by a 1/2 cup of black coffee every morning (which I hate btw). I feel so sick, my throat and stomach hurt and my body just aches. I purged just cuz I felt like it daily and it relieves the extra stress. I also self harmed a ton, which felt great, but now I'm so ashamed of myself. Ugh I hate myself so much right now

 Plus I got TONS of chocolate and candy (that's my family's thing) that I threw away because, heck, who am I kidding, I'm not gonna let myself eat that crap. I'm so ungrateful, I just throw away my presents. I also got plenty of body compliments like ""(my name), you look so thin and pretty!"", and ""you look so good! Do you do keto?, I heard it's great for weight loss"". Like umm, no, I don't do keto. That's for people who actually eat on a regular basis. And when they do, they dont immediately throw up. 

Tbh I'm sooo hungry but I'm not gonna eat. from my cut up arms to my sore, stomach acid coated throat, my body HURTS so bad. Since covid, everyone in my family looks so fat too. Except for me; Ive lost 30 lbs by starving and throwing up. I'm not gonna look like them, instead I'll just starve myself. Seems legit. For Christmas every year, everyone dresses up in the matching pjs. I got me the same size they got me last year, and the shirt was gigantic and the pants wouldnt even stay on my waist. In the picture, I was literally holding them up lol!

I’ve gone to multiple therapists and nothing holistic is working, however, my family and closest friends are against me taking the so-adamantly recommended antidepressant route to fix this issue due to negative experiences with those types of medications in the past. I’m an empath and my primary qualm about starting any sort of antidepressant is that I’ll become emotionally numb. Additionally, I currently have a hormonal IUD (Mirena) and I’m afraid that the antidepressant would negatively interact with it, causing me to spiral as I have body dysmorphia, anxiety, OCD, and mild depression. My body just can’t take the pain that this disorder causes anymore. I’ve developed food intolerances, insufferable stabbing stomach pains, bloating, and a constant sore throat over the past 3 years, and these symptoms are only exacerbating with time. At my worst (purging 3x a day at around age 17/18), I couldn’t even keep down water without being in debilitating pain. Anytime I go a month or two clean, I inevitably relapse. I have also regrettably developed a nicotine addiction over quarantine, which has curbed my bulimic episodes, however, whenever I try to quit nicotine, my bulimia comes back around full swing (3-4 episodes/wk with nicotine vs. 7+ episodes/wk without nicotine). The worst part about all of this is that I look completely “healthy”/“skinny” to the average person, yet I keep destroying my body on an almost daily basis because of this disorder. My self-worth has reached an all time low— I simply feel undeserving of anything positive in my life at this point because bulimia has distorted my self-perception to such a detrimental degree. My father has never had a clue about any of this, and honestly would probably not understand it, while my mother has either turned a blind eye or on occasion made snarky comments after I eat such as “Now don’t go and throw it all up.” Also, I go to college in a major city and am therefore not at my childhood home most of the time (where my episodes are usually more severe and frequent), however, that evidently hasn’t helped my recovery. I’m truly at a loss, and every day seems to be getting more difficult than the last. If anyone on here can offer some advice, I would be extremely grateful."

But since that day, I haven't b/p and am definitely determined to make it to my goal of at least 2021.
So how is everyone else doing rn??

Just remember whether you are at day 1 of recovery or are not even ready to break out of b/p behavior. If you are making little steps to challenge your ed, you're making progress. And that can be something as little as having one less binge a week.

Just here to motivate myself more and to hopefully do the same for someone else.

With the gatherings and big family meals, there was a lot of family drama going on, and I noticed that no one was really paying attention to me. So being the clown that I am, I decided to purge throughout the day whenever I wanted, just to test out my theory.

I told everyone that I have an upset stomach/need to go to the bathroom, multiple times throughout the day & no one cared. Hell, at one point I just walked out in the middle of the meal and when I came back no one noticed.

I was practically doing it just for the adrenaline rush & to entertain myself. And I wasn’t even binging, so it got to the point where it wasn’t even worth it to do it anymore. There was an incident involving me purging in the nastiest bathroom at a dim sum restaurant that made me shiver to just even think about.

And now I’m just so disappointed in myself for being so... childish, I guess? I’m a grown ass adult ffs, and I spent weeks prior to this convincing myself that I won’t purge because I’ve been doing so well. But family gatherings like this always make me feel like a child cos everyone is treating me like one. And it’s safe to say this is definitely one of the rock bottoms of this year for me.

my therapist says that i probably associate food with comfort, so recently i’ve been trying to remind myself that my binges are actually a source of discomfort for me (being uncomfortably full, the horrible process of purging, the anxiety of not knowing how many cals i actually absorbed, and the shame afterwards). i guess this post is just me trying to concretely make that connection."

We're a fresher couple (3 Months) but have known each other for years prior. My SO has been to mental hospitals and the like before but i never inquired as to why. A fee weeks into our relationship she confessed to being bulimic. I asked her when the last it was since she purged and she said that after we got together and even a little before, she hadn't purged in a while. This calmed me down a bit yet i remained worried.


We both live at our parents atm but my sister is out of town for a while and has asked me to take care of her dog and mind the apartment while she's gone. Of course i took the opportunity to leave home for a few weeks and also invited my SO to live with me. It's been a GREAT time so far but when i came home yesterday she admitted to purging while i was at work. I had asked her how her day was and what she did since she wasn't working that day and she brought it up like it was nothing among things like cleaning, going on walks with the dog, etc. 

At first i thought she was feeling sick (she had stomach aches a few days prior) but she told me she just threw up because she ""wanted to"".

I was shocked and literally every emotion rushed through me silently in the course of a minute. I have an issue with communicating my thoughts and emotions to others and in fear of hurting her feelings or negatively enforcing her behaviour i had just remained silent. She had asked me if i was upset and i literally was only able to nod or shake my head in response to her questions. Later i relocated toy bed where i was in a ""better"" headspace and asked her why she did it. She told me she looked at herself in the mirror while she was straightening her hair and hated how she looked. I was with her in the bathroom at the time and had noticed her being unusually quiet. At first I tried to talk to her but she seemed hyper focused on straightening her hair. 


I also asked her why she hated herself and she could only give me vague-ish answers. I told her i still loved her no matter how she looked and would support her in her endeavours to change but this wasn't the way to go.

Now I'm super worried since i don't want her to practice even more self harm (she already has a multitude of cutting scars) but i also don't want to be another source of pressure or anything that'll enable her actions.

It might've been a fluke yesterday but what if it's not? I don't know how to help her and only want her to be healthy. 


Any advice for me? How should i react? How can i support her without seeming forceful or pushy? Any hell would be appreciated on how i should deal with this situation!"

Even the binging was something that I kind of forced myself to do and I didn’t even want a lot of what I was eating. Then when I purged I found it super unsatisfactory.

Ive lost about 4 1/2 stone and I came back home from uni for Christmas hoping my family would finally say something nice about me but all Ive gotten is that Im too thin now... I broke down and told my aunt and my mum whats been going on with me but told them I had stopped (I haven’t) and talked about all the shit the family has put me through... my mum still made it all about herself, telling me that ‘Im breaking her heart’ shit like that... Im so exhausted and I know I need help but I can’t bring myself to it... it’s so hard because everyday I hate myself to the point where I find it hard looking in a mirror or looking at pictures of myself... I feel so desperately lonely sometimes because no one I know has experienced this and the lack of support to the extent that I have... idk haha it’s so shit and I feel myself slipping back into that self-hate attitude...

I’ve been away from my family for a very long time and attending boarding school made it very easy to hide my b/p behavior. 

Recently I started to live on my own and it’s all just gotten so much worse. I b/p up to 3 times a day. 

The biggest problem now is that I spend all the money I have on delivery food. I have no self control and it scares me. Also, I can’t focus on anything, there are so many things I’d like to do but all I can think about is food. I’m going to start working in January and I’m afraid that my eating disorder will seriously affect my performance at work. 

On the other jobs I allowed myself to eat in order to focus, but that only lead to me gaining weight and feeling depressed. 

I just feel like my weight and looks are the only thing that define me. My Ed stared when I gained weight once and I noticed that people began to treat me differently (including mean comments from my parents). 

My bf does not understand. He gets mad at me when I “rant” and says that I’m negative, he doesn’t want to listen to it and that I should just eat normally. I don’t know how to communicate with him. 

I sought help multiple times. I took ssris and went to therapy but I could not fix it. 

I can’t do it anymore. I want to be better. I feel like I just don’t deserve to be here because other people could utilize my resources and things that I should be grateful to have so much better. I just wanted to spill it out, because no one wants to listen anymore.."

My boyfriend for the past few months has been calling himself fat on a regular basis and it’s only gotten worse and more frequent. I expressed my concerns, because he has been losing weight and went from a little chubby to skinny and very fit, I told him his self-talk worried me about his self image and potential eating disorder. 

Well today he told me that last night he ate a big dinner and felt like shit, and then tried to throw it up for the first time. He told me he stares at his stomach in the mirror everyday and is disgusted by how “fat” he is. 

I tried to be supportive and comforting. I suggested he does research on the risks and affects of bulimia to hopefully steer him away from the disorder before it gets worse. Or even to get a physical with a doctor so they can reassure him that he is healthy and fit.

I thanked him for opening up to me and asked him to please tell me if something like this happens again.

Was it fair and appropriate of me to ask him this?

I really want to go about supporting him the best way possible, I don’t want to overstep or overwhelm him or deal with it poorly."

I find it difficult to navigate when it comes to healthy/nutritious food. 

On one side, healthy food is good for your body and your mental health as well. It gives your body energy and nutrition - and you think better and perform better.

On the other side, healthy food for me has been associated with strict dieting and weight loss for many years.

For the past month or two I have been eating candy everyday, because I want no food restrictions in my life no more.

But the thing is, I’m afraid to adapt unhealthy food habits, not to take care of my body and mind. Does it make sense without me sounding as if I’m afraid of gaining weight?

How do you balance ED recovery and a healthy lifestyle without falling into old ED lifestyle patterns? How do you focus on well-being and nutrition in a healthy manner?"

Hi everyone I'm not exactly sure how to preface this so I'll just get straight into the story.

So I live in an apartment complex with decently thick walls but I'm still able to hear my neighbors. For example I can sometimes hear my upstairs neighbors footsteps or the person who resides next to me playing music or sneezing. Just minor stuff like that. However the past few months I've been hearing my next door neighbor vomiting. At first I didn't think much of it and just thought he was sick or had food poisoning but the vomiting started to happen more frequently and during specific times of the day. I will usually hear him in the bathroom in the morning anywhere between 10-11am. This would occur sometimes three days in a row to maybe only once a week but still frequently enough to raise my concern and start thinking beyond this being a cold or flu. I thought about stopping by and asking him if everything is okay but ruled out that might not be the best idea.

I really have no knowledge of eating disorders and I don't know if asking him if he's ok or if he's struggling with something such as bulimia would be triggering to him. I should also mention that I've never once had a conversation with him at all. We've only seen each other in passing which is another reason I've held off on talking to him about this. I don't know if a stranger asking about such an intimate problem without any form of relationship is the most appropriate thing to do.  This is what led me here.

I wanted to ask what the best course of action is in this situation. Is there a resource or organization I should contact that is better equipped to do a wellness check, should I go over and ask if everything is ok? I'm really just not sure but I am definitely concerned and want him to be safe. Thanks for reading everyone and I hope to receive some advice on the matter!"

I remember it was a beef dish of some sort. The meat chunk was huge and tough, but I was inhaling it, because i was hungry and in an episode (where i eat so quick and so much that my brain have a hard time to catch up).

Then it ends and i was feeling so guilty and I had to purge it all out. A particularly big chunk of meat get lodged in its way out. I was gasping for air and panicking but luckily I managed to swallowed it back in (sorry! i know its gross). It was the scariest moment of my life.  I was all alone by myself in the house at that time, I can't imagine what would happen if i was not able to dislodged it.

So, my dearest fighters and survivors, chew your food well. It help to slow down your eating to an extent, and help keep you safe if you can't help but purge afterwards (as safe as it can be anyway).

Because imagine being found dead in a washroom, with a toilet bowl full of vomit."

Hi. I'm a 17 year old girl and I just need to rant im sorry. No one knows about anything I'm dealing with because I hate talking about my emotions to anyone close to me, it just hurts to know that they think I'm happy when im the farthest thing from it, and im literally the only person to blame. onto the rest of my rant:

I'm exhausted. I have week long cycles of restricting to about 100 calories a day and then the next week I'll eat normally/binge and feel like a whale. For the past 6 months I've stayed within the same 6/7 pound weight range but I swear the difference those 7 pounds makes is terrifying. When i think about it logically I know that it doesn't make that much of a difference and its likely its mostly water weight, but I can't get the disordered side of me to understand. I can't make myself leave the house because I feel huge and I feel like my face looks so chubby and everyone will notice the change. Even worse all my friends are like victoria-secret model skinny, and just gorgeous. I've always had bad body image and tried restricting before but ever since I was prescribed adderall it completely rids me of any hunger. at all. and I dropped over 30 pounds. Im so terrified for myself and proud and excited at the same time. I *hate* that this is the only thing that brings me excitement nowadays. Nothing else gets the same reaction out of me like seeing the scale drop. (TW weight) I'm 5'7 and weigh 135-142 depending on the day/week. I see other girls who are my height and weigh similar amounts and they just look so much skinnier and I don't know what im doing wrong. Is it my bone structure? I dont know. I'm just so tired but I can't stop because when I eat I feel so ugly that I dont want to move, i dont want to look in the mirror and I dont want anyone, *anyone,* to see me. And it feels even worse than not eating, because i feel pretty when Im hungry. I saw someone else say ""its misery either way but at least the progress is satisfying"" and it breaks my heart that this is what I have become and that I can't fix it. I don't know how to, and i dont know if i even want to."

Before COVID I had only ever binged/purged a handful of times, like months apart from each instance. I only started doing it a little over 2 years ago, once I started eating healthy and getting to a healthy weight. I lost the weight healthily and have maintained since (activity trying to gain muscle weight) but there were sometimes I bp’ed.

I started binged and purging more with Covid. In April-November would do 1-2 bp’s a week, (like I would eat a bunch of cashews but take baking soda while I do it so it wouldn’t be so acidic when I threw up), 

but quite a few weeks I went without doing it at all, maybe even a month. 

But since the beginning of November I would do 2-3 binge days (in which I mean one of those day I would binge/purge 2-3 times during that day. It’s because of the holidays...

Like I said I do the baking soda thing and don’t brush my teeth after, but I was wondering how quickly it effects you’re teeth...

I’m getting it under control but I feel so guilty about my teeth.

Edit: I started eating healthy and working out when I was 19, I’m 21 now. And my bulimia seemed to be correlated with my injured back, I have back pain that flares up and makes it hard to work out as I want to."

I binge eat and self-induced vomit typically on weekends, but sometimes during the weekday because I always go over my calorie limit. I throw up because I fear I’ll gain weight and get fat.

So needless to say, it felt like success. 

It’s been 3 years since I’ve graduated, but I’m still battling bulimia for the upcoming 7th year. It is EXHAUSTING. I know the difficulty, the mental issues, how hard it is to keep up, etc. And I want to stop, but something isn’t letting me. It’s like, if I eat, I’m so guilty. 

My biggest issue is bingeeating. Past being full. And for bad reasons too. Like, in the morning I could get up and eat an egg or two. But since I’ve eaten now I feel like I have to purge. So i guzzle water and binge eat. It’s like, I don’t even eat anymore for the nutrition and the sustenance. But I eat just so I can purge. 

So far only sleeping really helps. Does anyone have some tips to put the desire to binge eat at bay?"

I’m overweight. I’ve gained almost 20 kilo this year. I’m just in such a bad place right now. I’ve come to understand that I seem to have some sort of sugar addiction. I don’t have a lid for the amount of sugar I can consume. I’ll easily eat 1000 calories in one sitting, then eat another thousand after a short brake. I don’t eat much. It’s just that the food I eat contains so many calories. I’m also mostly sedentary due to chronic illness, but I’m hoping to work out two times a week in the new year with my physiotherapist... 
but it’s the food. I can’t seem to say no. I spend the little money I have on chocolate and candy. I lost my job earlier this year due to covid and I’m waiting to be approved for disability checks. But I have no money as it all goes to pain management methods.. and food. I only wear pyjamas these days because none of my clothes fit me, and I can’t afford new ones.

I desperately need to lose weight. I’ve struggled with binging for a while, and I’ve recently started purging; only not as effective at the moment because I’m currently on antibiotics. It’s honestly the only thing that makes me feel good. Because then at least I didn’t really eat all that food... 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for with this post. I’m planning on trying keto after Christmas, and my mom has agreed to join me, but she’s even worse at diets than I am, and I rely on her to make most food and buy groceries.

Have any of you had success with weighloss on keto?

I’m also going to a consultation about trying hypnosis. I’m not one for “alternative” medicine, but I’m at my wits end. Have any of you tried hypnosis? 

I don’t know what to do if it doesn’t work. I just feel completely hopeless. Doesn’t help that Christmas only brings bad memories and my birthday is coming up, which never fails to make me severely suicidal.

You’d think that a financial crisis would motivate me to get my expensive binging habit under control, but we all know that it doesn’t work that way. My bulimia is worse than ever. I’m purging everything I eat and binging whatever and whenever I can.

My therapist wants me to go residential. I had a 90-minute phone assessment with someone at a local treatment center and she also urged that I go. There’s a waitlist, but I could potentially admit myself in January.

The problem is the cost. It’s over $1,300 a day, and they want me to spend at least a month there. It’s in my insurance network, but I have to spend $4,000 to meet my deductible...and then my insurance will only cover half.

I have no savings. My parents can’t help me. The only way I could pull it off would be getting myself into horrific debt. So the question I’m asking is this: is it worth it?

I truly believe this disorder will kill me if it goes on like this. But I truly feel like such an end is inevitable. Feeling afraid and hopeless."

I had a bloodtest a few months ago with elevated levels in my kidney and liver. I'm hoping these changes could reverse that :)"

My husband and I has been together for 10 years. I have been bulimic for 10+ years. Together we have lived a restrictive lifestyle, trying different diets together, exercised together, made weight-loss bets, and talked a lot about food and body on a regular basis.

I am trying to recover now. I really want to live a restrictive free life and a life where I feel comfortable in my body.

My husband is on a diet right now, has been loosing weight and is doing workout almost everyday. He has told me that he wants no snacks in the house. Everyday when he gets home from work he will tell me what he has been eating throughout the day. He comments on my eating. And I have to prepare food that fits his diet.

If you too is trying to recovery from an eating disorder you clearly see the problem. How do you deal with someone who is not supportive of your recovery? Someone who feels that you are ‘pulling’ them down. Who tells you to mind your own business. Tells you to grow up.

Any advice?"

kfiwmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/kfiwmt/worst_birthday_ive_ever_had/,Worst birthday I’ve ever had,7,2,1608288201.0,"Yesterday was my birthday, I am now 15, and I say without any hesitation, that 2020 has been the absolute worst everything for me. Holy shit, my New Years resolution for 2020 was to lose weight, and I did it, but at what cost? Binging and purging every single day multiple times a day just to remain the same weight I started at in the morning? Why? Why am I hurting myself just to see the number 108.4 on the scale. I haven’t gone below that weight, and it’s the lowest I’ve ever been. And the only possible way to maintain that weight is to b/p anything I put in my body.

My birthday started off with my Grandma and Mom going to the doctors because she has some skin condition and we have no idea what it is. So all I wanted was to spend time with her since she recently came home 2 weeks ago after not seeing her for half a decade, and I just wanted to hug and be there with her and my Mom. So that loneliness and worry turned into resentment.

My Dad spent the majority of his day in the garage making stuff. My brother never spends time with me, so when he came downstairs and sat on the couch next to me for awhile (I was already upset), I told him “If you really care about me then why don’t you spend more time with me when it’s not my birthday?” And I tried forcing him to go upstairs and talk with his friends since that’s what he does for the vast majority of the time. Later I ended up apologizing since my Mom brought up the fact that he just slugs around a lot and probably just wanted to spend time with me. But any other day, such as today, when I want to go somewhere and spend some time with him I ask him to go grocery shopping with me and he gets pissed off. Sorry dude, if I could drive myself I would. 

After my brother tries spending time with me and I shoo him upstairs I realize, “huh, this is the perfect time to purge, I’m all alone. The only two people who are always on my ass about purging are the women of the house.” So I make myself a fat ass breakfast. Breakfast is always the meal that I b/p but usually I just have oatmeal accompanied with an Oreo or something. So I whip up 2 1/2 waffles and 2 pancakes. Not to mention they were drenched in syrup and covered in frosting and sprinkles. Oh! And of course 2 pieces of turkey bacon cause we need our protein amiright? 

So after successfully demolishing my breakfast. I felt pretty good about eating my feelings. So I took two zevias, a tub of frosting, and 7 golden Oreos up to the bathroom to do my business. I don’t know how but I had the easiest time purging those starchy waffles and pancakes. 

After b/ping all of that I was absolutely exhausted. By then it was about 4:00 and my Grandma and Mom were on their way home. I still had only talked to my brother, and I was feeling puffy, tired, empty, and extremely dehydrated. All I wanted to do was lay in my Moms arms and cry, I wanted to tell her that I was sorry for failing her and that purging was so easy. But I sat there, poker faced on the couch, until I fell asleep. Drowning in my own thoughts. 

My Mom and Grandma get home and I learn that my Grandma had to get a chunk of her skin taken out and they weren’t able to close the wound so she went upstairs to lay down to try to relieve some of the excruciating pain she had been in. All I could do was watch her wobble up the stairs in pain, I couldn’t do anything. And all I wanted to do was take away her pain. It was the absolute worst. But one thing we could do was get her dinner, she hadn’t eaten in 8 hours.

So dinner. What’s for dinner? Sushi! Of course! My Dad promised me to get me a ton of sushi for my birthday. Here’s an examples of the order:

3x calamari
2x crab puffs
Crunchy roll
California rollx3
Volcano roll
Dragon roll
Spicy tuna roll
Crab roll
Eel special 
Spider rollx2

This ended up being $230 worth of food. And all I could think was how much of his money I was going to waste. We get the sushi, and now dessert. I really wanted to go to cold stone and take everybody out so that we could all create our own so that everyone was happy, but my Mom said that was unreasonable so we got an ice cream cake instead. Now here’s where the dilemma comes in; I really want this red velvet birthday cake one, but I say that it’s small. So my Mom points out the Reese’s cake. Don’t get me wrong, I love Reese’s, but there was so much chocolate I felt like it would have been too rich. But she insisted, so we got the Reese’s cake and retrieved our sushi, and returned home to stuff our faces. And that we did.

We successfully ate ALL of the sushi and appetizers. I had a ginormous food baby and I just kept on eating. After we ate they brought out my present.

I got a HUGE fluffy zip up jacket and it was love at first sight-till I tried it on. My Mom could see the disappointment in my eyes and my mannerisms, and she was pissed. “You told me to try and get sometching because you said you liked the sentimental value!” (I said this about jewelry, when I told her that I wanted to pick out my own clothes and wait till Christmas to have them she didn’t approve) so we end up bickering until my Dad slams his hands on the table and says “WHO WANTS CAKE?” to try and lighten us all up. But I teared up because my Mom was mad and it hurt because I really missed her. She ended up saying “We would’ve had candles if you had told us what cake you wanted beforehand” but I had mentioned the cold stone cup idea days before my birthday. So I ended up having 13 on my cake. And now when we go back and watch the video of them singing happy birthday to me on my fifteenth they’re going to see me looking like absolute dog shit and depressed. And I know what my Moms going to say

“You had such an attitude that year teehee” 

I was really looking forward to this cake so I cut two slices worth of this cake in hopes that it’s absolutely delicious. I take a bite, yearning for that peanut buttery chocolate goodness-
And what do I get?

Coffee and toffee. 

My disappointment hit my like a rock. Everyone else tastes it too, at this point the whole day feels like shit. And then my brother brings up the fact that I owe him 20 bucks even though he said I don’t have to pay him back because he saw that I got $30. At this point everything pisses me off. I’m about ready to cry and roll into a ball of hormones and confusion of my own emotions. So we watch a movie! Yes! I get to cry without anyone bugging me! Or so I thought. 

I lay on the couch and my Mom sits next me me because she knows I’m crying. She says why I was so off today and asks why I was so snappy and mean. She said the whole family could feel it. I tell her I don’t know and try to get her to sit next to my Dad since she never sits next to me and she snapped 


“Stop.”

“Stop what?”

“Stop bossing everyone around all the time”

“Ok”

So she leaves and sits next to my Dad. And I cried, I finally let it out. She calls my name like a song bird and I respond with “iM aWake” Of course my voice had to crack.

So she grabs me and gives me a hug, mind you, my Dad still hasn’t payed any attention to me for the whole day. So him seeing this makes me feel ashamed for some reason. And I start to feel better. 

But then the thought clicks! 

I have to purge! I didn’t even notice how huge my stomach was until it started churning. So I tell her that I want to go to bed and she lets me go. And I purged until there was nothing left to purge.

All I could think about was the money. I had eaten at least 1/3 of all that sushi easily. And there it was, sitting in a toilet bowl. After this i drink water and give my Mom one last hug before bed. All I wanted was to sleep next to her, that’s all I wanted. I didn’t want to be alone, I couldn’t tell her I purged the whole day. It would break her heart, and she had so much to worry about already.

What she doesn’t know can’t hurt her, right?

So we all go to bed and I spend 20 minutes balking my eyes out. 

“15, and you’re a fucking mess.”

So I try to turn the day around and apologize to my brother. Which makes me feel a little better, but the cake still upset me. 

I was in bed alone, stomach stretched and empty. Every time I took a deep breath it hurt because of the fact that it was so full and then suddenly everything in it was gone. I stared at the ceiling and I could think of was

“I ruined my fifteenth birthday.”"

I'm 27 years old, living at home with my parents and I've had bulimia for 13-14 years.  
Even before that I always has ""eating issues"". when I was 8 I refused to swallow any food for months, then refused to eat at school, etc.  


So when I was 13-14 I weighed 79kg (174lbs), at 165cm (5ft4)   
I was overweight, and about to enroll in a full-time fashion school -to be a designer.  
Was getting bullied, didn't have friends and now looking at the fashion industry, so I decided I was gonna stop eating and get thin.

Lost about 15kg (33lbs) over summer. Everyone told me how good I looked and applauded me for my hard work. Ofcourse people started to notice my lack of eating, had all eyes on me.  
After a couple weeks working long days at school I couldn't take it anymore and started to binge at night. That led into the ""just undo it"" mentality, and I was happily b/p like I solved the puzzle and found the easy fix.  
At 15 I got heart palpitations all the time, turned out I had developed arythmia and tbh I felt so proud. Hell yes, I fucked up my body bad enough to do some actual damage.  


Then my parents found out about my nasty habit and dragged me to the doctor (my parents arent exactly compassionate or understanding people) and my doctor made it so I had to talk to a therapist every tuesday at school, I was getting pulled out of class for it.  
So with my parents also watching me now, I was unable to purge, as I had to shower with the bathroom door open, couldn't sit in my room with the door closed, they'd stand by the door when I went to the bathroom, etc.  
So I gained back the weight, cause it's not like you can just stop binging like that.

Didn't take long for me to start going on runs after dinner, and then purge in the forest behind a tree, and run home. Lost the weight again, and even lost more than the first time.  
I was now about 60kg (132lbs) not skinny, but the best weight I ever got to.

My parents thought I was fine, and was just losing the weight cause of my daily runs.  
During winter I wasn't allowed to go run outside, so yeah, I started gaining weight again, unable to purge. And at some point my mom said to me that I had screwed up by gaining back the weight, that I looked better when I wasn't eating.

This kept going for yeeears. Cycles of restricting and then b/p when I could, and my parents never found out again. Heighest weight was 99kg (218lbs).

Till last november when I was suffering from chronic migraines and TLE (temporal lobe epilepsy) and I got put on topiramate for 9 months. A side effect of topiramate is loss of appetite, and in some cases it's used to treat bulimia and BED, cause it calms down urges and impulses.  
It worked awesome for me. I had some nasty side effects but my ED seemed gone, like that voice in the back of my mind was silenced for the first time in 13 years. I was eating healthy, normal food, and didn't feel bad about it. I lost about 7kg, setting me at around 75kg, and I was fine with it.  
UNTIL my neurologist asked me to stop taking it cause of the side effects and the long-term consequences.   
I didn't think anything of it, cause my neurologist said there's a chance it had ""rewired"" my brain.  
I'm now 3 months without the meds, and my ED has been back for about 2 months i'd say.  
I'm unable to eat normally, I binge all the damn time and I feel like i'm coming closer and closer to purging again. I'm so angry and irritated all the time. It's extremely frustrating to get a taste of a normal life and then go back to this. I've gained 8kg so far."

All while still going to the gym, full time biology undergrad student, and working 12 hour shifts on a Saturday. As time went on the restrictive eating faded out and it was severe bulimia, up to 4 times, every meal everyday. I ran my body into the ground. 
I finally realized I needed help with my bulimia in February this year. I started therapy in February, was considered to be im recovery since August, and stopped therapy in October. 
Recovery got harder once stopping therapy and the hunger and tiredness took over. I thought I was tired before but this was different. I feel like a baby some days just being hungry and sleeping. It's a constant battle between I'm hungry and I've eaten enough, I need to recover/grow and I've eaten enough. I've actually lost weight since being in recovery, and now I get comments from people saying I'm so skinny and need to put on weight 🙃 
4 months into recovery and I still think about binging and purging everyday. Or sometimes just purging even if I haven't binged. I'm eating when I'm hungry but that's still more than before. Then I start thinking have I eaten too much and did I just binge? When I clearly didn't. A mental battle everyday. 

Recovery feels like a full time job 😪 alongside an actual full time job and planning a wedding for next year. The boy I met at 17 is the man I get to call my husband 🥰 

That's one thing that keeps me from relapsing, I want a future without this disease that's taken over my life. But sometimes it just feels easier to fall back into it all. It was definitely a coping mechanism for me. 

Anyone else feel anything similar?"

Anyway! I was bulimic back when I was 17 (I’m 25 now) & I don’t quit remember the recovery process. Mostly because at the time I was insanely resistant with getting better lol so I probably dissociated a lot as to cope with my unwanted changing reality.
When I was 17 though, I had help from a therapist & an ED group. This time around, I’ve more or less kept it to myself.
The first few days without purging was completely fine. I ate like I normally would, though stopped myself from binging as to ultimately prevent it from leading to purging. & it’s been a good time tbh.
Today however, I felt nauseous. Health wise I feel fine, I don’t feel sick or as if I’m coming down with a cold. I’m pretty healthy when it comes to water consumption & snacking on healthier snack options here & there (though normally they’d get purged)
After I had dinner though, some spaghetti, I felt nauseous. Not after but like....while I was eating?? Like my body didn’t want to eat? It got so bad that I actually stopped having dinner because I thought I was going to through up.
Maybe 10 minutes after I stopped eating, the nauseated feeling went away.
My question is, is this a natural reaction? Is my body just learning how to get back to a normal state without b/p?
I know I should go in to see a doctor but I think I’ve been holding off on it because of Covid. Plus I’m terrified they’re going to find something seriously wrong with my insides or my blood or something. Idk. 
I’m scaring myself now."

How do you handle
I talk a lot about bulimia with my boyfriend and it turned out being with him kind of keeps me away from the purging part and helps me stop eating before I feel sick (still eat to much though) 
He’s being very strict because he wants me to get better. I agreed with this because I want to recover more than anything else in the world. 
Thats how He developed a very strong authority on me. 
I have the feeling he might be using it too further sometimes. He gets a blowjob every day, mostly more then one. I have this thoughts that he manipulates me for his own good because he got power over me through my weaknesses. 
He has total control of my emotions. If he feels less happy than I do, he’ll come to me and pull a few triggers to bring me to cry in 10 seconds. 
Then he’ll cuddle me and tell me he understands... it gets me confused but this overload keeps me from eating. 
He lives 500km away from me so we always spend a few days together, then I go back. 
When I get home, most of the time I’m nervously and emotionally exhausted and binge and purge 2-3 times to get me resettled. Sometimes it’s enough but mostly I continue during a few days before I come back to my yoga and meditation practice and then I get myself together and go back to that healthier lifestyle I’ve been working on so much. 

We’re meant to move in together in spring. I’m not sure about it. But I also have this thoughts that my bulimia makes a bad portrait of him because he keeps me from purging. He keeps offering sweets and crisps and so on though... 

And to this I answer : I must be manipulating him to buy this stuff for me because I’m such a wicked binger. 

That mental process is full of triggers and he pulls them and laughs. I don’t know if this can be a good training and he love me and I should stop overreacting or if I’m blinded by love, weakened by bulimia and actually his damn victim.

Think of it, you get an urge. The B/P urge. You sit in your car, bedroom, anywhere but the kitchen. Get your purge jam on (am I the only one with a playlist?), walk through a binge in your head (only in your head). Walk through every detail. What you’d reach for, how fast you’d down it, what you’d mix with it, this is ✨ guilt-free ✨ with all of the food you desire accessible to you. 

and then, *in your mind*, walk to your purge spot and imagine the sensation of purging:

the acid in your throat, the food coming up your nose, the heart pounding, the chest tightening, the burning sensation to come in your esophagus (that lasts for days after), the smell, the temp of the food, the tears in your eyes, the swelling in your face, everything. Give yourself the full mental experience. 
If you don’t vomit, rather restrict, walk yourself through the stages of your restriction. The 1-2 days of uncomfortable bloating. The indigestion.  The feeling of just wanting it again and it never being enough. 
Telling yourself again, “it’s the last time”. 

And then you open your eyes. 

You are back to where you started. Your stomach doesn’t have all the binge food in it. You feel the same you’d feel if you hadn’t purged/restricted your binge food. No drawbacks of health palpations, chest pains, shame, guilt, tooth decay, diarrhea, diabetes, kidney failure, cardiac arrest, etc.

*Trigger warning* 

Anorexia, Bulimia, Nicotine, Laxatives

So lately I’ve been relapsing extremely hard. I’ve been switching back and forth between restriction, b/p, and now my new adopted behavior: vaping. I just recently started it and oh my god it’s amazing. It literally suppresses my appetite so much. It takes away all of my cravings but at the same time I’m relying on it wayyyy too much. I’ll literally get up in the morning, down at least 1 or 2 bang energy drinks and hit my vape 10-12 times. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t enjoy b/p anymore, which I see as progress, but it’s like I’m trading one bad habit for another. I’ve also been using intimacy to numb the emotional & mental pain I’m going through as well. It really sucks because I feel so lonely and I was doing so good for so long... or eating “normally”. I actually gained quite a bit of weight back and now my main focus is to just get it all off again. I could really use some kind words of encouragement... and support. This battle feels so lonely. Love you all. ❤️"

Cool, doc. There are studies. But I know plenty of people who are bulimic and anorexic (Myself included) and we have lost a severe amount of weight. 

I have been seeking help, but it is hard to read about when doctors nowadays act like we bulimics aren't actually losing weight. I get it, it is to discourage teens and women and men from being bulimic by saying it doesn't work as a weight loss routine, but IT DOES WORK. In the most terrible way possible, but it does.

I do not see how lying will help, but I need help tips with the weight loss. My problem is severe, and again, these articles I read online do not help.

They claim my body is supposed to ""hold on to everything since it is so used to losing"" but it just doesn't. 

My PCP (Primary Care Physician) recently had this conversation with me about how the online discouragement of bulimia and anorexia often dismisses the symptoms of those who have been doing it a long time...

That feeling when you know you haven’t gotten it all up. When you told your family you were wrapping presents so you could lock your door, sit on your knees on the ground, and purge the chips you just ate into a bowl. Then sneakily go to the bathroom and try to get the rest of it up. When nothing more is coming, your gag reflex isn’t responding the same anymore because you’ve been doing it too much lately, but you’re so, so sure you haven’t gotten it all so you keep shoving your fingers down your throat, but nothing is coming. You feel disgusting, not for making yourself sick but for eating those chips. You knew the second you casually asked your brother to pick some up for you exactly how you would be spending the evening. You’re so close to your goal weight, and yet you sabotage with needless calories and trying to make up for them by purging them. You hate the way that you sometimes like the feeling of purging, and how it makes you feel like you’re actively doing something to help. 
The only sense of relief comes with the pangs of hunger later in the evening, and you try to take comfort in knowing that perhaps you got rid of those calories."

I don’t normally eat like that. I feel like I just binged, especially with the container of chips. I don’t have the urge to purge right now. I’m past the point of anything coming up if I did purge, which I’m proud of (I typically purge immediately after or within 20 minutes. But I ate over an hour ago)
Is this normal? I feel completely fine. I regret eating all the chips at once, but I’m not hating myself for it (keeping in mind that I would have eaten them all periodically anyway.)
I’m scared this is normal but one day soon I’m going to crazy binge & purge everything.
I’m scared this is a happy high, like it’s going “so well” but something triggering will happen where I’ll relapse.

Scrambled eggs & rice is my go to meal when I’m not sure what to eat. But I always purge it (like everything else) it definitely feels weird not to purge it.

Anyway so yeah, should I just go with it & not worry about it? How do I stop worrying about future stuff? I know that’s a loaded question. But I just have this insane fear that everything is good right now but one day soon I’ll relapse."

About 7 years ago I got home from college, my parents weren't around so it was the perfect time to binge. Binged mainly on frozen dinner spaghetti, ofcourse didn't properly chew cause I wanted to stuff as much down as possible in a short time, so I could purge before my parents got home.   
Started purging and I choked on the noodles. In my panic I took a deep breathe and got vomit in my lungs. That sh\*t hurts. I was so scared, thinking I was gonna die right there and then and my parents would find me. I flushed the toilet and cleaned up while coughing so hard, everything hurt so bad. I went to lay in bed and wait for my parents. They got home, heard me coughing and wheezing and I told them I got sick at school and it's been getting worse. I was coughing up mucus and blood. They took me to our GP, he sent me to the hospital caused it looked like pneumonia and I had a fever. Had the full check up and I told the doc what happened. Long story short, I was on several courses of antibiotics and couldnt go to college for a month, and then was short of breath for another couple months. The doc told my parents I had pneumonia, cause I was an adult and didnt want them to know what happened. In their eyes, my bulimia was a ""phase"" I went through when I was 15 years old, not an ongoing issue into my twenties. I didn't purge while I was recovering, but also used my sickness as an excuse to skip meals and eat very little for a couple months, then I went straight back to b/p.

Sooo last night, I used and abused DXM (cough syrup) for the 2nd day in a row and 3rd time overall to get high. I also smoked some of my mom's medical marijuana, and took my prescribed 1 mg Ativan to get high. I knew it was wrong. I especially knew if my best friend found out, she would be pissed.

The weird thing though is the DXM kinda triggered my ED (I've been diagnosed with bulimia) by giving me body dysmorphia. It made my face look sooo much thinner. Bc of this, I ended up looking at b\*\*\*spo/t\*\*\*spo and felt a strong urge to just starve for as long as I could.

Another thing DXM does is it decreases your appetite. So when I lost weight, I was so happy! However, I knew I needed help for this. I knew this was wrong. So I told my mom.

Aaaand of course, she got pissed .\_\_\_\_\_.

I didn't even know DXM would do this to me. Like, if this gets worse, if this gets out of control, which it already is starting to, how tf do I find a 3-in-one rehab/residential for ED/drugs/trauma??? And one that would be willing to accept my service dog on top of that. My mom, while she was pissed, sarcastically told me, ""Good luck,"" trying to find that 3-in-one."

My therapist ask me what other things I do after binging if I don’t purge and I said that I exercise. She basically told me that if I don’t purge after I binge then I’m basically good and there’s no mental health problem to that. It’s ok if I binge and exercise, just as long as I don’t purge. But there’s still problem with the binging. I’ve been trying to tell her for so long that my problem lay with binging. As long as I don’t binge, I won’t purge. I don’t really restrict my calories so it’s not like I binge because I restrict. It’s something else but I’m not getting a grasp on what it is yet. 
I don’t know my point is just that what she said rubs me the wrong way lol. It just feels like her invalidating binging eating disorder maybe? Or that I don’t have a problem as long as I don’t purge (?). It just sucks cause I already question if I really suffer an ED when I clearly do go through the binge-purge cycle but I just haven’t been purging as much since I’m so tired of it.

kbg5hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/kbg5hx/my_mom_keeps_triggering_me/,My mom keeps triggering me,7,3,1607737320.0,"A little bit of background: I’ve always had a poor body image, and from middle school through to college I dealt with bulimia that included heavy restricting. Through therapy and some deep thinking I realized a lot of it had to do with my family and the obsession with beauty in their culture (im a 1st generation American). 

    My extended family doesn’t take mental health seriously, even making fun of me and embarrassing me in front of the entire family when my toilet got clogged with vomit while visiting in their country. While my mom has cried and tried to reach me when I was at my worst, she’s also a major factor in triggering me. She constantly comments on my body, one day saying I look beautiful the next saying I look weird (ex: saying my head looks big or I look like a marshmallow on toothpicks). When I tell her it hurts when she insults me she gets angry and says I’m too sensitive and “Americanized” to take a joke. While it would probably be funny if I was a mentally healthy person, it actually exacerbates my BDD and sends me into a spiral. 

At this point I’ve moved back home out of necessity for covid related reasons, and I’m going to be living with her for a while, so instead of changing what she does, I want to find a way to protect myself. 

Currently, I’ve relapsed into restriction, but I’m taking care not to let it be unhealthy, I just want to lose weight, but when she sees me she starts making comments on my body, asking what I’ve eaten, acting all upset when I tell her to leave me alone. She guilt trips me into eating a lot of food, and I end up bingeing and purging for days. She becomes happier when I gain weight from this awful cycle, while I’m hurting inside. 

To reiterate, she won’t stop commenting on my body because “she’s my mom, she created me so she can comment on my body whenever she likes and if I don’t like it I’m being horrible to her because she was only joking” 
I can’t change how she was raised, or the culture she grew up in, but can I change the way it’s been affecting me?"

I tend to stay in that period for a while until finally it goes to far and I snap. My body can’t handle being deprived of nutrients anymore so then I go back to binging uncontrollably which then turns into binging and purging uncontrollably. 

These periods tend to last from a month to multiple months at a time. 

Binging and purging becomes my coping mechanism but eventually it just stops helping. Like I’m numb to it and I have no way to cope anymore. I guess that’s also why I go back into anorexic periods, because it’s another way to cope.

I then tried to off myself and i got a lot of attention from doctors, therapists and social services all wondering how they could help me. I dont think that helped me. I started to become obsessed with making myself sick and losing weight and finally after years of disordered eating and months of obsessive starvation, binging and purging i finally got to my goal 7 stone 13. i lost 2 stone in 3 months. 

but i still dont think i can stop. this is my life now and i dont think ive lost enough. i thought when i got here i would stop but i want to lose more. i want to be 6 stone 13. this will be hard to hide from my therapist who weighs me each week but i think i could weight my shoes and be able to lose weight whil still appear healthy to her so hopefully i can get to my new goal. 

this is a warning to those who have just started to fall into this pit of obsession that you won’t be able to stop. its impossible when you’re addicted and its part of who you are

i dont care if i lose teeth or if my throat rips to shreds i have to get to my goal weight and quickly"

We are currently looking for people over 16 who experience/have ever experienced eating disorder symptoms to take part in our research study and share their experiences. While we are looking to improve how psychologists and clinicians measure your eating disorder recovery process, you do not need to be currently in or considering recovery to participate. Anybody is welcome.

If you decide to take part or wish to see more information about the study (e.g. how we will keep your responses safe and what the questions will involve), please click the following link: [https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_1KVOaiQaiBIB1mB](https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1KVOaiQaiBIB1mB)

The study should take approximately 20 minutes to complete but you can take as long as you need. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm, and your eating disorder symptoms and recovery experience so far. If there is a chance that this could be triggering, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

Thank you,

Rebecca."

Its so effing expensive & have no money left. Been stealing food (both binge and regular stuff) which I’m not proud of, but am running out of money for the week within 2-3 days. Heart hurts and have no energy, but the worst part is just this terrible feeling of helplessness. Ive been trying SO hard these past 9 months and not only has nothing changed things have just gotten progressively worse. I realize it’s likely to stay this way till the lockdown ends (which is more or less a year here) and you guys it’s so damn depressing. Dunno if I can make it through another year of this. Also having no one to talk to adds another layer of despair which I’m sure a lot of y’all can relate to.

She says it isn't bulimia or anything but god i'm just so so scared i hope this isn't insensitive to anyone here i know i'm new to this and very uneducated lmao
she had an eating disorder for years now and we both have a big self harm problem. and anyways she told me about her purging earlier today and i just don't know what to do she says she hates doing it and that she's trying to stop and i just am so scared it's not gonna stop. i can really only compare purging to self harm because that's what i have experienced. I know when i started self harming it sounded the exact same to how she purges (only once a week short term relief, feeling horrible about it and vowing to never do it again).
Is purging similar to self harm? do i have a right to be so scared it's gonna get worse? is there any advice you could give me?
also i try and stay as supportive of her as i can i love her so much but some times i just say the wrong thing when it comes to eating disorders i feel horrible about not understanding it i hope i haven't said anything that might be ignorant or insensitive"

After I throw up, of course my hands stink so I would wash my hands with soap to take away the smell. Lately, I've been eating granola (about 1-2 tbs per day) and I hate it. To stop, I only rinse my hands with water after I purge so when go to put my hand that's holding the granola near my face, I smell the vomit and decide against eating it. I know it's gross but for some reason I only allow myself to eat granola and I need to stop before I gain any weight. 

2. Also, can purging cause watery and bloodshot eyes? I look like a monster after I purge but never when I don't. My face gets super red and my eyes are bloodshot and a lot of times a tear will come down my face (I'm not crying tho). Also my neck veins almost pop thru my skin. 

3. I am very active in church and a few semi-close friends have been talking to me concerning my weight. They are suspicious and say they never see me eat and have lost a lot of weight, although I don't see it except for a few pounds here and there. Have any of you ever dealt with religious (Christian in my case) people regarding an ED? I definitely don't want anyone to know but if they start asking questions I might have no choice but tell them."

I was sitting on a couch, draped in the orange evening sunlight coming through the blinds, and eating slices of American cheese. In order to prolong the mouthfeel and the flavour, I did not swallow it all the way, and instead pushed the clump of cheese back up when it passed the tonsils. Up until this point, I often got stomach poisoning and was treated at home with gallons of warm water which I drank and puked until only clean water came out. Because of this, I have lost my gag reflex and gained an ability to puke on demand, so when the clump of cheese went down the esophagus into the stomach I had no trouble bringing it back up. It was then that I realised that food could be enjoyed multiple times by regulating it back into my mouth again and again until it completely disintegrated and was no longer palatable. This habit lasted for a few years until a couple of close calls where I was caught off guard with a mouthful of puke. That's when I graduated to my current obsession: purging...

I am almost 24 now, and for the last 10 years, I have been overeating, binging, stuffing my mouth, pigging out and throwing up. It has long ago become more than a habit or compulsion, it is an addiction at this point. Even though I am able to curb it sometimes, I can never(so it seems) get rid of it completely. I was able to force myself to fast for weeks at a time, only drinking water, follow strict diets, and exercise, but my fear of getting fat and my compulsion to eat junk forces me to purge. As a guy who holds a no-bullshit, down to earth, masculine persona, I find it impossible to talk openly about this with anyone. Nobody knows, I do this as quietly and discreetly as I can. I am sure my family and gf suspect something, but they never made direct inquiries about bulimia, and considering my past illnesses I could always blame my back stomach when my mother asked if I puked. I really do not want this to become known, I just want to stop and find a way to control my urge to overeat. It is not pleasant and Is detrimental to my life. I waste money, time, and energy on something that upsets me. Today, I came home from work, and a compulsion to binge came over me. I was driven by what felt to be a foreign force to eat as quickly, and as much as I could. At first, I tried to rationalize: since there is an unfinished pack of ramen, there is no harm in finishing it up and then throwing it up, after all, it is unhealthy. So I inhaled a pack of uncooked ramen, and the binge started. At this point, I had tunnel vision, noise in my years, and an unquenchable desire to stuff my mouth. Not eat, it literally was about, putting things in my mouth and swallowing like a machine. I was overcome with feelings of impending doom and I felt that swallowing is the only way to stop it, but with every ""bite"" it felt closer and closer. I sprinted( not a metaphor) to the fringe, grabbed a jar of jam with noticeably shaking hands, and ate it with my fingers. Then I heated up a stick of butter in the microwave. While waiting for it to heat I ate condensed milk. Then I grabbed potato chips and mashed them with the butter and poured tea over the whole thing to make it wet. This bling craze culminated in me violently throwing up all over the toilet. After purging, drained, and lightheaded I had to stop myself from going back. Two hours later I did this again. I have to stop. This is taking over my life. It is clouding my mind. It's making me worse as a person.

Apologies for the long post and the drama. First time I ""told"" anyone. Any advice is welcomed."

I’m not too sure how to post about this or where so I thought this might be a good start. I have been slightly overweight my entire life and have an incredibly addictive personally. This along with my adoration of food made me develop a severe binging disorder over the past year. I am now trying to work on it and eat better so I have cut out everything I used to binge cold turkey but I still get intense cravings. As of now I have been doing it for about a week and I have already broken my diet and purged twice. I know it’s still so new but in my head it’s the only way to get the best of both worlds.

I've booked an appointment with a dietitian for the first time in years, but to be honest I'm not that committed out of fear of the weight gain, I saw a recovery story on YouTube that said that a weight gain of around 5 kg [11 lbs] was normal in the first month of recovery, mainly because bulimia messes up with your cells hydration and your digestive system so it takes time to heal that. My fear is that I'm currently at the higher end of a normal BMI, a 5 kg weight gain would set me in the overweight category.

I’m stuck in a bad restrict-binge cycle and it’s been that way for almost the entire year. I would eat 400-700 calories everyday for a month and then binge. The problem is that I don’t binge for just one day, I end up binging for like 3-5 days. I tell myself to stop binging but I end up binging again the next day cause my brain tells me to. I don’t think it’s extreme hunger because I would just eat and binge on sweets that I didn’t allow myself to eat before instead of craving for actual filling meals. Despite eating that amount of calories I don’t even lose weight anymore, that’s how badly I have messed up my metabolism. I end up just maintaining.

Do you think it’s okay to plan binges, like at least one binge per week? Do you think it’ll lessen my problem with binging or worsen it? Do you think it’ll just end up with me justifying my tendencies to binge due to restriction? I saw on ED youtube say how planning binges helps them lessen their obsessive food thoughts or urge to binge. Whenever I restrict I ALWAYS just think of food constantly the entire day, which was worsened by quarantine because I spend every second of everyday at home surrounded by food I could possible just binge. I just want to hear what people think about planned binges 🥺

Also, I think that people in general have a perception of what an eating disorder should look like. I’ve been dealing with bulimia for years and have fairly maintained a normal weight. That doesn’t mean my mental health is alright. I have suffered and let my disease control my life, all I thought about was food. I have people around me that have suffered from anorexia and it was interesting to see the response that she had and all the help that people were willing to give her. I don’t want to sound like I’m being bitter. But I feel that because bulimia doesn’t have a certain look, there isn’t as much help from people around you. I have heard more stories of people dealing with bulimia alone than anorexia (not going to recovery places, etc). When I opened up to one of my friends about my ED a few years ago when we were talking about our friend with anorexia, he told me that “wow I didn’t know you had it, like I met you a while ago, but were you like bad, like skinny before we met”. “I’ve never seen you like you know”. For a while I thought about those words so much. I kept telling myself that I didn’t have a problem and that I was overreacting with my ED. I was incredibly triggered by that comment. Now I’m in recovery and I feel good, however, I always wonder what would have happened if someone noticed and helped me when I was a 13 year old with bulimia."

so I’ve never written on Reddit before but I don’t really feel comfortable talking to anyone about this so I figured I’d just write this here. I’ve never been diagnosed with bulimia but I’ve always had a problem with eating. I’m 19 (almost 20) and ever since I can remember I’ve had a problem with binging. I started making myself sick when I was a senior in high school, but it was only like 2 times in that year. Then I went to college and I gained a lot of weight. The realization kicked in for me and I started making myself sick more and more often. 

It’s always after I eat something I know I shouldn’t have and I just have that feeling that overcomes my body that I feel like I can’t ignore. I’ll be out with friends and they want to get ice cream or dessert and I’ll go and get it with them, then immediately after I’ll feel instant regret. Like a sense of urgency- like I have to go get sick right now because I shouldnt have done that. One of the first times this happened, I even told my friends I didn’t feel well just to go pull trig behind a literal dumpster like wtf. I told them I just had a stomach ache and that’s why I threw up, when in reality I feel like I couldn’t even continue hanging out with them while it was still in my stomach. 

So I started doing the keto diet to lose weight and it made me feel so much better about myself, but sometimes I’ll just lose control and binge eat non-keto snacks, and it feels so good until it doesn’t. Like the realization sets in almost immediately after I finish eating and then the regret sets in. I want to stop the binging but I literally just feel like I can’t control it. 

I’ve only ever mentioned it slightly to one person that I do this- and it was my childhood best friend- and he really isn’t the kind of person who you go to with this sort of thing.

I am seriously struggling. Binging and purging is something that I’ve been struggling with on and off with for over two years now. I thought that I didn’t have an eating disorder, as the purging episodes would come in waves - sometimes I’d purge 10 times a week and sometimes I wouldn’t purge for 2 or 3 weeks. However, now it’s so constant. When I eat food, I can feel every ounce sitting in my stomach and I can’t help but purge. I’m starting to get really, really scared because I can see negative effects forming - constipation, yellowing teeth, exhaustion, constant hoarse throat, puffy eyes, etc. I have no idea where to go or what to do. 

I guess the moral of my tangent, when y’all were struggling and seeking help, where did you go? How on earth did you tell your doctor your binging and purging? 

Thank y’all so much for taking the time to read this."

I'm 20 years old and I've been suffering from Bulimia for a little over two years now. I just recently opened up to authorities such as my doctor, therapist and some friends. I discovered this subreddit a few months ago and saw that some were dealing with bulimia and eating disorders for so many years before opening up and I thought the two years were already aging time. The Bulimia spawned, mixed with some other factors, Depressions and I've also been in a clinic for a couple of days before dismissing myself because I thought I was strong enough to treat it ambulatory, but that's not the case. It's quite the opposite, actually. I've been told by my doctor that it's not unusual for people like us to, well, die. Even if you're not underweight, regurgitating can cause organ failure and then it's just a matter of time when your body stops the autopilot and rings all bells. I'm apathetic towards my life already and I'm just 20 years old. A situation and an age many of you probably are in as well. I've been living alone since I was 17 and I've always successfully put on a facade to not come off as suspicious. I hit the gym 4 times a week because I wanted to lose weight, but I strived for more and more. I lost more and more weight and combined with the Bulimia, I've become underweight. I don't go to the gym anymore because I've realized it harms me more than it helps me in my current situation. I have an eat attack about almost every day now and I realized that clinical treatment is the only other way besides basically dying at this point. Depression and Bulimia are nothing you should underestimate and I know it takes a lot of strength and self confidence to talk about an eating disorder. You show yourself at your worst and open up to others, showing weakness. It is easier to keep silent and instead of self reflecting, just ignoring it. I know how unorganized the thoughts and how bipolar the attitude can be. You constantly think about food, you're apathetic, you're feeling cold and so on. You probably know this yourself, but it's not the normal thoughts and behavior people like us should have. Do yourself the favor and, if you've tried everything before but nothing works, then talk with your doctor about clinical treatment. It is free here in Germany and I don't know how it exactly works for you guys, but the few days I was in the clinic helped me very much. So much that I thought I could handle it by myself, which sadly isn't the case. I'm scheduled for a 12 week treatment on the 4th of January and I know it's going to be a hard and energy consuming time, but it'll be for my own sake. A thing all of you should consider as well. Our body will just deteriorate further and further until the autopilot starts collapsing. I'm not quite ready to throw the towel yet and I hope in some way I can encourage someone to seek out help for their own sake. Keep safe, everybody."

So I really want to stop purging, at least as much as I am right now, because it’s gotten pretty out of control and I haven’t really been keeping anything down. My esophagus is getting torn up and there’s more blood in the purge every time and it’s more painful every time. 
The problem is: every time I eat even small amounts, it’s really painful and my stomach feels like it will burst. It’s a bit scary and very uncomfortable so I end up purging. 
Does anybody know if there are any foods that are maybe a bit easier on the digestive tract at first?

&#x200b;

Edits:

1.) (Aside from water and dissolved sodium and potassium chloride salt, which serves to dilute the stomach's contents with something at least not too hypotonic^(3) and yet still also fairly homeostatically neutral^(4).)

2.) (And also, I'm not taking activated carbon, >!i've tried that $hit before and it also would probably just make me throw up or if i didn't, even hurt my guts a lot and then give me diarrhea.!< The stuff i tried was made from burnt coconut shells though so maybe not all activated carbon is harmful and maybe only that was the problem, and like maybe even only with that particular pill-contained brand, like if maybe the shells they used were bad or something was wrong with the roasting process. Anyhow now I'm very wary of consuming activated carbon.)

3.) (And also to maybe help in making up a post-purge calorie defecit without adding anything more difficult and too toxic just yet, also some kind of healthyish sugar? (So like, the sugars naturally present in fruits are maybe ok, as well as also like pure glucose or even the sugar-alcohol glycerol?) Idk, but it seems to make some sense, scientifically anyway. Probably wouldn't help much with making back a 'fullness' defecit, though. Also, sugars--glucose most particularly--also help with increasing a fluid's hypertonicity, which, aside from impeding gut absorption, may also be important if, like, one wants to avoid just getting immediately all bloated again, even if it be only with fluids.)

4.) For one, perhaps near-isotonic; but additionally (and this is like maybe somewhat more important if the beverage leans on the hypotonic side of things since i think maybe more of it will be getting more quickly absorbed), also somewhat matching maintenance-level concentrations and relative ratios of sodium and potassium, chloride and maybe even some bicarbonate, maybe magnesium and/or calcium, perhaps even di-hydrogen- and/or mono-hydrogen- phosphate if the beverage includes that, glucose, maybe glycerol, and who knows, maybe even some people balance glucose levels with optimally homeostatically most-balanced levels of BHB. Could maybe be helpful if one wants to stress one's blood sugar insulin and glucagon feed-back system most minimally. This is all just the speculation of a novice studier of medicine, though."

Now that I’m bulimic I idolise anorexia more than anything. I hate myself for not being able to be that way again because that was true control, not this. I miss feeling good at something, I miss feelings small. 

It’s like nothing is ever good enough. Its like I’m constantly searching for some kind of a pattern or plan that makes me feel secure and safe and in control but nothing is ever good enough. Nothing ever makes me like myself more, if anything I like myself less. I tear myself apart because I idolise what I don’t have. I’m trying to find balance but can’t.

I guess I’m just scared because in my mind the effects of bulimia are worse (I know it mainly revolves around the severity of the disorder but i mean on a more general level I guess). I feel guilty for being like this and I don’t want to know how I’m destroying myself but then at the same time all I want to do is destroy myself. I just find it weird the difference. I guess even near the end of my last anorexic episode I stopped researching. I don’t know there was something so enticing at the beginning and now it’s just hell. Eating Disorders are the ultimate love-hate relationship, they convince you that they’re heaven, and in some ways they are, but mostly it’s just hell and even thought that’s becoming more clear to me as time passes I can’t escape it. Why does it have to be so addictive? I don’t feel capable of eating normally anymore, it’s either too much or too little there’s no in between anymore. It’s either purge or starve. I wish I never went down this path but I also know that I never would’ve lost weight another way, it’s just not who I am so in a big way I’m grateful and I feel some shame in admitting that"

I miss the days when I could just restrict. I miss feeling good at something, now I just feel like a failure. One time I heard someone say “most bulimics are just failed anorexics”, I feel like I failed. For a while I convinced myself it was just a stage, that I’d restrict again soon but needed a break for now. The longer this goes on the more frequent it becomes, the more it becomes my default coping mechanism. The more I become comfortable with my own vomit and forcing my fingers down my throat and the constant scratches that lay at the back of it. I’m scared of being comfortable with bulimia but it’s like it’s crept up on me without me realising. I hate myself and my body so much so why can’t I just find the motivation to restrict? Why does food dictate me so much? I have no control over anything anymore. It’s sad because it’s all my fault and realistically I could fix it, if I just got my shit together, but for some reason I can’t. 

P.s. Please don’t take offence by any of this, this is just what my head tells me. It’s definitely not how I see bulimia as a whole I just needed a place to express how I feel and view myself. I don’t know maybe it’ll help me hold myself accountable"

I’m naturally more muscular than her so my weight is managed different and because of that, it really bothers her if I’m ever lighter than her bc visually, it’s a lot different because she naturally has more curves than I do because I’m just really flat in general. 

And while I have never mentioned numbers or anything to her since I’ve been recovering, my weight loss has been visually noticeable and I know because she has pointed it out. I’m not sure what hat to do?

Like many of you this pandemic has thrown my eating habits waay off, and it is affecting everything. One of the worst problems I currently feel like I am dealing with is the changes in my posture from months of hardly exercising, stretching, and the bloating from all the bullshit I’ve put in my body that may have caused muscular damage.

Starting in October I decided to kick my ass into gear and joined a running group. Forgot how amazing it better feels to really move again and it has always helped me stay on track with sleep and diet as well. I’m now realizing that my form is way off, I look awkward when I run and hunch forward to accommodate my expanded tum...sometimes it helps with the bloat but sometimes it makes it worse since I have such a weak core now and feel like my muscles are growing outward. I used to do a lot of yoga too but my flexibility has lessened and I’m worried about hurting myself and making the problem worse. 

I’m wondering who else has felt this or had any muscular problems from bloat that they were able to fix. I know I need to ease into it but exercising again has helped my mental health immensely, I just feel like my core is totally shot. I wake up pretty sore every day and every bone in my body seems to crack at random. I even started to research things like diastasis recti (separation of ab muscles that can happen with pregnancy) and it’s freaking me out. I’d like to avoid going to a chiropractor but could use some direction on how to deal with this before I fall off the wagon.

TL;DR Fuck bloating for making ED recovery even more agonizing and making it impossible to read other body signals properly"

They received supportive, comforting, sympathetic replies. Much to be expected from a community that is understanding of the struggles on both sides of families that are or have been impacted by eating disorders.

I offered up some potential insights, under the disclaimer that I didn't know their dad and could be wrong, but basing my two-cents on what I have observed to be the case for the overwhelming majority. I've been on both sides of an eating disorder. I've said things I wish I could take back. I've ruined friendships, scarred family relationships, and my eating disorder continues to gouge chunks out of my life. We struggle, we endure, we STRUGGLE to endure, and we do what we can to help people find the light in dark spaces. That's one of the reasons I love forums such as this, though I've been largely silent in the past.

They responded that I was wrong and that I just didn't get their dad. Okay, that's totally fine. I knew I could be wrong!

Except for this:

""If I'm being honest my posting here isnt out of love, it's to find a way for him to stop wasting food and wasting the time of doctors cause it's really annoying hearing him yell at my mom to make him something to eat only to vomit it out and complain about wondering what's wrong with him.""

I'm sorry, what now? Do you mean to say you came to a forum full of bulimics, many of whom suffer INCREDIBLE guilt for our behaviors, but you don't actually want help -possibly- understanding why your ""loved"" one is dismissive, combative, and defiant? I definitely didn't do a good job addressing why they may be combative, but I could have....if you hadn't essentially just said you weren't posting because you actually cared. Please, let us give you support and advice so you can just throw our behaviors back at us....

What I'm getting at, and not doing as well at putting into words as I'd like to, is that all that did was validate something that I (and others on here) struggle with: I am a burden on my friends/family/loved ones. 

BRO, YOU'RE WORKING IN A CIRCLE HERE! You want your dad to stop, but you don't want to offer love or support which, frankly, is your best chance at getting it to stop. You've already decided that you definitely know the motives and thoughts of your father except if we know anything about eating disorders it's that the sufferer is going to (consciously or not) make sure you actually don't. These disorders need a facade in order to thrive. We build walls. You see what we want you to see. Until there's enough trust for us to start taking those walls down, you have no real idea what's behind them. But you won't do that because you think you already know....and the cycle continues.

One of my biggest issues when I was in res was about leaving. When you're in a controlled environment with people who GET it, steps towards recovery are much easier. I was shit scared about leaving because I know the world is full of people like this poster who truly *think* they get it, but have no.freaking.idea. My dad's first mealtime remark when I got home was ""You're going to eat ALL THAT!?"" about my planned-by-a-goddamn-dietician dinner, but I digress. Point being, once again, that people presume to understand eating disorders, as an umbrella (which is a misconception on its own).

I said on a different subreddit that trying to explain an eating disorder to someone who has never had one is like trying to explain colors to someone who was born blind. I also pointed out that their feelings are not more important than ours, but that they are AS important. Both sides are going to have to swallow their pride at some point, if neither is going to pack up and run (which is a whole other elephant we fear - constantly). The thing is, they aren't in a situation where they need support to overcome something....so the pride swallowing sometimes has to start with them.

Anyway, I've rambled longer than I intended to, but I needed to get that out."

It started in high school primarily as a response to trauma. Been in therapy for almost a decade and understands that for her it’s a control thing. Anyway, I found out recently that she has been struggling with relapses. She got sick a few nights and last night vomited blood. We went to get her checked out at an ER and they are referring her to a GI specialist now.

Last night after we got home she told me what was going on. Asked me if I was mad and of course I’m not. No one chooses to have to deal with this burden and I don’t think she’s weak or that she just “did it to herself” or any other misconceptions. I just want to help in any way I can and I’m kinda shocked if I’m being honest.

It was more of a problem when we were in high school and when she was first getting into therapy. She had a bit of a rough time in our junior year of college with it. She’s on medications that help with depression and chronic pain that caused weight gain. I think that’s been a big trigger for her.

I’ve never once commented on her weight and I think she’s beautiful. In her mind she’s “undesirable” (that’s what she told me one night when she was drunk) but I don’t understand what has made her feel this way. Over the past year we’ve both been incredibly busy with school and work and we haven’t been having as much sex as we used to but we cuddle way more too.

I just hate knowing she feels this way about herself and I hate thinking  about the fact that she’s been silently struggling with this for awhile and didn’t feel like she could tell me.

I don’t want to force her to talk to me or anyone. I’m patient and totally fine with never having answers to some of this. I just want to know if there’s anything that partners do unknowingly that makes situations like this worse? I just want to help in any way I can because I love her and know eating disorders are lethal. Any insight is greatly appreciated and I sincerely apologize if any of this is triggering"

Okay maybe I’m gonna start crying. I don’t have anyone to go to. I don’t know if I’d want to. I almost hate that I tried intuitive eating because I gained weight when I stopped tracking. But I also think I was getting better and less food obsessed. And then I started to track again a few days ago. And then past two days I have been eating trigger foods like ice cream and Oreos. Like all of them. 

I also met someone I want to be with. And I feel like I almost was eating as a deterrent. Almost intentionally to gain weight. As if gaining weight will make me more unattractive and if he decides he doesn’t want me it’ll be because of my body and not who I am. Or I could relapse and push him away and say that I’m the one who isn’t ready. Avoid the external pain of rejection by creating self inflicted pain. Maybe I’m just thinking too much. 

I need resources or a conversation. Idk"

k47qkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/k47qkh/date_night/,Date Night,3,3,1606777611.0,I’ve been talking to this guy for a few months now and he asked me over tonight to hang out. We were just texting about dinner and some cheap options that we could make at his place and he mentioned stir fry and at first I was all for it; but the more I think about it the more it’s stressing me out. I keep thinking about the calories and how the oil will sit in my stomach and make me feel sick and how it won’t be that satisfying and I think I might purge after. Anyone else experience anxiety before date nights or have always of coping with it? I’m worried my disease will affect how I act in my relationship and I want so badly for this to go well but honestly eating is such a big part of dating especially with being in quarantine and everything being shut down.

On good days or on bad days (the latter being the overwhelming majority), it feels like I'll never be okay, like I am going to suffer from this forever. That feeling of hopelessness, of despair, it almost as bad as the actual purging.

My husband and my therapist keep saying one day I will be okay, but here I am, on the toilet again, 20 pounds heavier than I've ever been, no longer athletic, ruined my teeth, skin and hair.... how will I ever be okay again?

Even every time I have a good day, I know in the back of my mind it won't last. I will fall again, and when I do, I b/p over 5 times a day and it carries on for at least a week. Then one good, then rinse and repeat.

It's frustrating as hell, and I wrote a poem about it (below) to try to express it better than I am here.

&#x200B;

    You tell me I’m going to be okay
    But here I am again...hooray 
    I want to believe I won’t stay
    In the darkness
    But I feel like the carcass
    Of my former being
    Constantly seeing
    The path that was once freeing
    But is no longer
    I should be stronger
    To be okay
    But the good days are at bay
    While I lay 
    Under the hay
    Stack that might weigh 
    1000 Pounds
    Made of my ups and downs
    And all the sounds
    Of my tears
    And my old peers
    And the past years
    And the gears
    That I transferred into motion
    My devotion
    To the notion
    Of success
    But I guess
    I must confess 
    That my stress
    Made me digress
    Into a child 
    All riled 
    And wild.
    How can this be reconciled
    With being okay?
    If I’m my own worst enemy
    And have no empathy
    For my own pain
    As I continue to be the stain
    On my happiness 
    Drowning in crappiness
    Reliving the haunting nightmare
    Under the glare 
    Of my former fare
    You tell me I’m going to be okay 
    But that continues to weigh
    On my conscious mind
    As I already feel I signed
    My life away"
