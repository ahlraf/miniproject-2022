knv785,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knv785/wish_i_was_alone_for_new_years/,Wish I was alone for new years,2,6,1609439101.0,"So I, 14, am sitting here, with my parents, uncle and aunt, wishing I was back home, alone in my room, probably watching some movie. My sister and her friends are all out at a party, and none of my friends are allowed to be anywhere else but with their own families. Honestly, I know I'm probably sounding like a brat or a moody teen, probably am to some extent too, but idk, I'm feeling sad and lonely and just telling someone feels good, even though you are all stranger I'll never meet. Idk whats wrong with spending the new years with these adults, maybe its the age difference, so I just know I won't have a good time, my parents probably know that too, but they still made me come. Since I'm at least 30+ years younger than everyone else, I'll just be sitting here doing nothing, browsing on my phone, then It'll run out of battery and I'll be staring at the wall till it's time to leave, like always. If I was home I'd at least ve able to do something fun, like playing my uke or music or smt, just anything else than sitting here trying myhardest to just make time fly so I can go home and go to bed.


Update: Their cat loves me now, my day is infinetly better:)"
knv720,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knv720/my_secret_reason_for_hooking_up_with_guys_is_so/,My secret reason for hooking up with guys is so that they're connected to me forever.,2,5,1609439087.0,"One thing I've noticed about many guys is that, once you hook up with them, you become part of their ""mental list"" so to speak. Most guys have a mental list of girls they've hooked up with, and they think back on this list from time to time, and it gives them pleasure to think about it. Unless it's a guy who's literally hooking up with so many people that he can't remember them, which very few guys are doing, there will always be a tiny spot in his mind with your name on it, as long as he lives. I've also noticed some guys keep a folder with pics of the girls they've hooked up with - not necessarily nudes, just nice photos, like you're all part of his ""collection"" in a way.

I've noticed that the guys I've hooked up with, even the guys who wanted nothing more than a hookup and not a relationship, are more reliable than anyone else I know in reaching out to me on birthdays, holidays, and when I've posted about a major life event on social media - happy or sad. It's like they'll always be fond of me in a way and think of me periodically because I am on their list.

So there are guys who I want to be special to forever - who I want to remember me forever. I know I'll never play a major role in their lives but it's still nice to be always connected to them like that.

I never trick anyone into hooking up with me, and I've never ""used"" anyone who had major feelings for me or wanted more. I would have been happy to have had a real relationship with any of the guys I hooked up with. It happened with some of them but most didn't want that with me. All I could get was a hookup with them and that was fine.

However, I told a friend about this and she said it was creepy because I was hooking up with them under a false pretense. I said that wasn't true because I never lied to them or somehow tricked them into it. But she said it was still a false pretense because they think I hook up with them JUST because I want hook up. They don't know a big part of it is that I think there's a good chance I'll be connected to them forever and always have a place in their mind."

I am going to share my worst moment of 2020, if there would be a way to forget or may be delete a moment from our life i will do that at any cost, because it was the first time i felt that i am worthless, for that moment i felt like everything , every single fucking thing what i have done till now got wasted. I am not a result driven person, i like to enjoy the journey more than anything, although destiny was beautiful and now i am in love with what i got at the end, it was like everything what i have dreamed of, so you would be thinking what was that moment that made me to even write this, it was glimpse of the end result, and every input what could be done was over, you may say it was like firing a missile, now tracking it and you computer is saying that it is going to hit your head in a minute & you don't have any control thing of the missile . But i was lucky enough or you may say i had done enough work so that at the end after falling from such high level, i was able to survive my crash landing too, i love the memories of my journey to the end goal or you may say a new start, i am in love with my new start too, i met some really good people, good would be less effective word for them, because i am with very few best people of my age group of my country, i just started my college life in the best college of my country ,and one of the best of the world. And i am doing really good too. I don't know if i really want to forget that moment, because it made me stronger and showed the reality like what could happen, ***I believe in hoping for the best and being ready for the worst***, still it was worse than even my worst nightmare so i guess now i am strong enough to handle any such pressure and failure of life, but that moment was a lot pain, if i will be able to forget that and just remember the lesson .

 ( i am not sharing any detail because i don't want you to follow me like who i am why i am, it's like something in my mind and taking a lot of space, so i wanted to write it  somewhere anonymously and feel lighter)"

knuspr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knuspr/my_parents_skipped_over_loving_me/,My parents skipped over loving me,2,1,1609437782.0,"This may be long I’ll add a TL;DR at the bottom. 

So I have a lot of siblings, 4 of them are from different marriages though and I only have one full blood sibling. The issue is we were completely forgotten as kids. 
Growing up our siblings were given everything. They got the sports, tutors, cars at 16, college funds, love, and attention, but my parents didn’t do any of that for me and my brother. It felt like we were meant to be seen and not heard, just an addition because that’s what your suppose to do when you get married. Growing up we basically raised each other and they were always more interested in what the other siblings were doing and what their needs were. I eventually coped with this and thought they were just done with kids and we were never wanted (both accidents) so that was that. 
Now my oldest sister has kids. And my parents can’t get enough of them. The last straw was this Christmas my mom and dad drove 15 hours to go see my sister and her kids and are now only 4 hours away from me and won’t come see me. (I can’t leave for an entire day because of work but they are both retired) 
I think I now have to come to terms with the fact they they still like kids and what to have kids to give attention to, they just never loved me. 
Anyone else have an experience like this? 

TL;DR My parents ignored me my entire life, I thought it was because they didn’t want to have more kids but now they can’t get enough of their grandkids from my sister and still don’t pay attention to me."
knusog,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knusog/i_suck_as_a_husband_and_father/,I suck as a husband and father,0,0,1609437779.0,"I cheated on my wife and blew up my family. We were in a rocky place she moved closer to her grandparent. I lived and worked without seeing her for 6 months.

Month 1 after no talking and getting yelled at for not talking loud enough and mumbling on the phone she cut contact with me for 5 days i wasnt in the best of places so i asked for a divorce. She called and cried and texted every hour it was the worst thing to go through.

Month 2 after dealing with myself i went to a different town for the day to shop and get outa my head i happend to run into an old friend from my childhood(A), i later messaged her asking where i can go to eat at thats local i was meeting a buddy for some beers she suggested a place then asked to tag along i was fine with it just us 3. Well it was just me and her catching up mostly talked all evening ended up getting drunk and then there was just this feeling of closeness i never felt and she held my hand and we kissed it was probably alcohol but we left together for the night.

 We spent every free moment i had together i felt guilty for how much fun  we had together we went to museums, art shows, strip clubs, baseball games A was truely my best friend. After a month A was pregnant her first my 3rd. I didnt know what to do i was moving jobs in 4 months . So we spent what time we could together like we always did.
At the middle of month 5 A loses the pregnancy and it crushes her and also me. She wants me to stay but im lost in the wind. Heart broken and everything i still feel broken from cheating, on top of this i was in an even worse spot mentally than when this all started. 

End of month six i ended up living on my brothers couch i still pay for everything for my wife, i meet with my wife and we still go through it but had disagreements. My children come to live with me for the summer that turns into for half a school year which turns into fulltime. My wife always argued with what she was owed feeling guilty i gave her everything besides full custody because my kids werent living with her.

 I tried committing suicide around the time A was due. Me and A are no longer speaking since the miscarriage. Im more focused on building a life for me and my kids. After 3 years and finally a good place in my career and having bought a house my wife reconciled with me even though i had another relationship while we were separated. 
We  are going strong through everything, i just cant talk about my loss or when it gets me down even with a new baby i still can not hurt for me and A's child. 

Ive met up with A on a business  trip. No we didnt have sex. She's married has a son with one on the way. All of us went to the childrens museum it was good talking with her  and sharing parenting tips.  It was good to catch up but now im mentally fucked up mouring a child i shouldnt have even had to begin with.
 Im ok i talked with my therapist and im not near selfharm its just making me feel like the worst father and husband for feeling like this while i have a family again."

as per the holidays I'm making an effort to enjoy fun food as it comes and eat healthy otherwise that is to say very limited snacks and candy replacing sugar with fruit, whole grains, high protien etc l stopped weighing myself because it was becoming toxic 
on top of all this i do an hour on the elliptical every night this is at a 1.0 incline and 4 resistance (it's a nordictrack)
but whenever I look in the mirror or put on clothes I cant percieve myself I cant tell what I look like I feel obese I eat something like pancakes for the first time in a month and feel guilty and stupid like I'm a disgusting whale 
sometimes I miss the body I had when I was skinny-fat it just sucks I hate feeling like I'm in a mushy skin suit and changing that cuts out any joy I have in food and results in me feeling downright exhausted I'm functional but miserable, but eating as is makes me feel heavier, obtuse and generally unfair  but the tradeoff is having energy and actually being able to lift shit (I live on a farm so it's nice to be able to lift a hay bale or water bucket without seeing ny life flash before my eyes) it's just frustrating and tiring and I feel ugly and mushy"

knulbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knulbc/i_just_want_forgiveness/,I just want forgiveness.,1,0,1609437127.0,"I dont know where else to put this so im trying here. It hurts. My stomachs in a knot, my head won't focus, I just want to sleep permanently and escape. I haven't cried in 10 years due to masculinity and the need to feel like I should be strong but I've been crying every night and I've forgotten how salty tears are.

I thought I'd grown accustomed to pain and could numb it out like I've been able to before but not this time. Here's the context. I've been seeing a girl for about a month and everything has been different. Normally my relationships end about the 3 months (its more of a pattern than a quilt) and end with me being cheated on. Its probably my poor taste in women but I always try to put 100% into a relationship and typically get maybe 30%. But not this time. This time I literally felt like I found my soul mate. Shes exactly like me, she's amazing, she's perfect, God she's so beautiful. She genuinely cares about me and is the sweetest, nicest person I've ever met. A heart of gold. But this time around instead of being cheated on, the situation is reverse. Last week she just found out she was pregnant with another man's baby from about 2 months before she met me (so she's 3 months pregnant). She we waited a week to get her head straight before telling me (I knew something was up because she was having pains so I told her to go the doctor and get checked. We didn't have much of conversation up until about 2 days ago). When she told me, I had a mix of the most confusing emotions I've ever had. I was angry but I knew it was nobodies fault and that my anger was just aimless and unjustified. After asking for advice about what I should do to some buddies from the Marines (I've never done this before because I've never really anyone growing up to having noone to talk too.  Bad childhood) I decided it doesn't matter, I want to be with her, even if it means supporting the child thats not mine. 

Now. I do not like the Father. Without this becoming insanely long, let's just say in my eyes hes kinda a scum bag. A quick recap, they dated in the past and he cheated on her with a married woman. But they're still friends. So theres animosity. The kicker? She texted me saying she talked with her family and him and felt she should do right by him and the child. She sent to this to me at 5:30 in the morning.

Now. I have anger problems. Combine that with bad trust problems from all my previous relationships (a lot) and I reacted like I did as if I had been cheated on. I said some terrible things. A combination of high emotions and generally being a grump in the morning when I wake up, my first response was ""so he won"". That was the first mistake. The second was accusing her of looking for an excuse to go back to him (a byproduct of being cheated on so much). The child did not deserve to be called an excuse. Her life is not a game. And when it hit me I said thise nasty things I felt my blood pressure drop. Her next text told me she regretted sending that message and wanted to send another saying she wanted to take it all back and she doesn't know what she was thinking and that she wants me and not him but now she wants me to leave her alone because I had hurt her. And she thought she knew me. I fucking cried. Im confused. She said she wants me and just leave her alone. She said she thought I'd fight for her when push comes to shove like I said I would but I just reacted like I would if I had been cheated on. She didn't deserve that. This situation isn't her fault.

Normally I just burn everything around me when I end up broken up with. Which is why I originally lashed out But not this time. I've sent her a few messages. I never seek forgiveness but this time I am. I hope I can be. Shes my happiness. I want to fight her. Im hoping that since she hasn't blocked yet that maybe there's still a chance. I normally don't hope because I have such a poor view of the world, of how life works, of how people are and terrible most are. But this time is different. 

So the point of this post is, do you think I can be forgiven? Can I ask for any advice? Do you think there's a chance? Sorry for a rambling incoherent post but my head is so jumbled I dont know what to do. Please someone just give me some hope."

I can't really stand behind the promise of America anymore, the shining potential of equality and freedom we CAN be, bolstered by the most inclusive and pliable government structure ever devised IMO. 

Trumpism, Josh Hawley, QAnon, the Kraken - this isn't what American should ever project. Dismissing the entirety of the Biden vote because you don't like the result...have you never been disappointed? How does losing equate to attempted coups and treason? And there's no accountability, meaning Sen. McConnell can continue to screw over all Americans, but especially the ones who need the most assistance, even if they don't get that. Marco Rubio can jump the line to get the vaccine and then in the  same moment CRITICIZE the public health officials who've done every fucking thing possible to mitigate the mendacity and vanity and ignorance of of idiots named MARCO RUBIO. Where are his criticism of DeSantis, as he slowly kills Florida? While VP Pence bemoans how the democrats want to help the poor. AS IF HELPING OTHERS IS A CHARACTER FLAW. Goddamn it, it's infuriating.

I'm a HS principal and a professor at a community college, US History, in fact. How do I tell students that life is full of disappointments when they see grown ass adult who've sworn to uphold the Constitution, work so diligently to undermine their own oaths, because they refuse to accept the truth? I used to believe that the American promise is the struggle toward true equality and justice for all, but in fact, no, the 21st century promise of America is that if I don't agree with you, you don't matter. 

So, now  I just kind of despair that all the potential and hope we've provided throughout our history, both to ourselves and the larger world community is lost. Instead of embracing our inner light, we've consumed fire and anger. All because they can't accept the results of the election, which has driven them over the edge. 

I love what America can stand for, but I can't stand America today."

I downloaded the app again because I was really lonely and needed someone to meet and just to hang out with. I didn’t change the age setting so it was basically 18 and up and I started swiping.

He was an attractive guy with funny pictures and a nice smile so I swiped right. Then I realized he’s 20. He texted me, we started talking and he asked me if I want to meet up. We both get tested for covid regularly so that wasn’t an issue. 


 Since then we’ve had like 8 dates and we ended up being in an FWB situation. I only slept with him after the 4th date or so, he’s not as experienced as me so I thought it’s best to take things slower than with an older guy. 

The age gap is too big for a relationship, I made that very clear and he’s fine with that. 

I like to talk to him, I like to listen to him, he is a great person and we have the kind of chemistry I’ve been missing for years. The sex is absolutely amazing. 

There’s only one person, my roommate who met him and knows about this. She’s not judging at all. 
But I made a post back then on Reddit, asking people for advice on this and I got terrible comments and messages, people telling me that I’m a creep and a predator. I felt like shit even though I know I’m not doing anything wrong. 

That’s it. It feels good to get it out because I started questioning my own judgement and my morals which is something I’ve never done before. I promised myself not to care, I’m gonna enjoy this while it lasts and communicate as openly as before so no one gets hurt. 

I wish a happy 2021 to everyone!"

It's a 1-2 year cycle of being completely broke, living somewhere where I don't like it, and feeling bad and sad. Then suddenly something good happens every time, I have some success, I'm happy, I feel hopeful, I work a lot, and a while later I end up at square one, always for different reasons. It seems like no matter how much I try to make it last, it's a never ending cycle.


I don't have depression or anything, like it doesn't happen because first I start to feel different.


And I end up like right now, broke, lonely, and feeling totally lost.


I just don't get it. Like now looking back, I regret again that I didn't use my time more wisely. I don't even know where all my time went. I worked a lot (I'm a freelancer, and how much I make or not make seems to go in circles too but it's always at least enough to live), but I also have plans for a real small business, something that's unique and that everyone tells me I really should keep pursuing. I put a ton of work into that, and really I can't even pinpoint why this also never takes off. It's not quality of effort or work, what drives me crazy is I DON'T KNOW WHY.


This has become such a pattern, and I'm normally pretty good at figuring stuff or myself out. But this I don't know.


It even happens when I'm dating. I meet a guy, he likes me, and suddenly it's just done. Or I don't understand while it's happening that the guy even likes me, or how much I like him.


I know it must be something I do, and really I wish I would know what it was so I could fix it. But I don't. I have friends and I'm a normal person. I don't get it.


So now I'm lost again. I'm subletting a place I don't like because work was slow and I couldn't renew my lease.


And 2 hours ago, my mom calls and says that for reasons Idk, a distant elderly uncle (whom I met once) has decided to gift me, my brother and my cousin a pretty generous amount of money for christmas. It's not a crazy amount, but enough for me to do much better come the next few months in addition to my own pay. Like I can look for a normal small apartment again. I'm pretty good at money management, so I'll just use it for deposit and stuffs.


And that's what I mean. Always something happens that I bounce back, but it never stays there. I don't know wtf it is then.


I already know I end up right back here again, a year or two at the most. It's been like this all my adult life. I'm so tired of it that sometimes I feel it's not even worth it anymore.


I get amazing out of the blue opportunities, I'm actually a pretty lucky person, and then I always manage to not make them last and I fucking don't know why or how. I analyzed it up and down and I just don't know why.


(And if someone has advice or anything, I'd love to:) Just nothing like go to counseling, because that's become a standard answer, and I'd rather hear if someone has personal advice or experience, because they've been there or they have an idea. The only counseling I'd love to go right now is business counceling, but that's too expensive).


And also thank you for listening."
kntt9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kntt9i/a_deep_conversation_with_my_so_made_me_realise/,A deep conversation with my SO made me realise something.,3,0,1609434630.0,"For some days, I've been thinking about myself, in my one year relationship with this beautiful person. I didn't think we'll last that long tbh, but we did. Within that one year, there were bad days, obviously. Bad days where we let our faults get the best of us, especially me.

During our bad days, I'd be mad and tell close friends how annoying he is, or how he doesn't understand me. Let's just say I get really defensive, but at the same time, I blame myself for it, a lot. Self blame usually comes up when that anger dies down, with the guilt following up. It wasn't nice, all those intense negative feelings coming at once, blaming him and mostly myself. 

I've considered ending our relationship at one point, but that was when I get in my angry state, not thinking rationally, but I'm happy I didn't, because I would have pushed him away. He's only one that's willing to deal with my shit because he's in love with me, and I'm in love with him.

The night before, I was in a fowl mood,  and I couldn't really identify what I was feeling at that moment, until I talked to a finsta friend. I realized that it was self anger because of my horrible flaw; overthinking. This has been a major issue in our relationship because I'd misunderstand something, then go out of control with my emotions, leading to intense overthinking like ""maybe he's just stupid, maybe I'm the cause of this, I shouldn't have said anything, is this it for us?"" Many scenarios will play in my head, I wouldn't want to believe them but it feels like my mind does its own thing. 

It's not like I haven't told him how I feel about my stupid flaw, I usually tell him with the thought of ""it's not like he'll understand."" I know he'll understand, but I keep believing what my mind brings up, then I stick to it. Kinda toxic if you ask me. 

Well, yesterday, i decided to discard that thought for once and told him how i feel about my flaw, and how it's a huge problem to people around me, and him. Then that thought came up again, ""He won't get it. Stop talking."" I pushed that thought, down down down, I wasn't going to fuck up again because of my over thinking side.

 I thought he'd probably brush it under the carpet, which I had believed for a while. But he didn't, he perfectly understood the fact that it's a part of me, though I'll have to work on it, and I've been through a lot before I met him, so it makes sense that I'm trying to protect myself, even though I really suck at it with my overthinking. He also stressed how crappy our long distance relationship is because we can't spend time together often, to loosen me up. 

After that short yet wholesome conversation, I realized that all along, I've been afraid. I was afraid that if I tell him all this, he wouldn't understand me. That fear grew in my chest, becoming an unbearable weight, thus making up stupid scenarios that he doesn't care about me, that he's just with me because of my body. I believed a lot of fucked up shit, I've said fowl things about him/to him, and I can't take it all back because of my overthinking ass. I felt terrible for my unforgivable acts in the past, all because I thought he didn't care about me that much. He forgave me, and I vowed to never make such mistake ever again. 

I realized how much he means to me. Yo, I love him...so  damn much. 

I need to improve myself, not just for him, but for me too. It's going to be really hard but it's worth a try. Even if we don't last in the end, I'll be happy that it didn't end because of me, I'm done blaming myself. 

If you read to this point, I'd like to send virtual hugs to you. This is something that I just had to type down. I don't think that fear will come back anytime soon tho."

You talk to each other and hang out when sun shines. You deal with your crap yourself or get professional help to do so and none of that ""hey you're my friend could you help me out with x, y, z"" shit and its variants.

If things get deep, some sort of anxious obligation switch turns on in me and I feel like I have to watch out for everything and my boundaries diminish and I feel responsible for anything that may go wrong. Suddenly I feel like I'm trapped with someone that may or may not be a benevolent person. I'm absolutely unable to enjoy these ""close friendships"" that are seen as the ideal. For me it's a source of anxiety. 

I don't want to discuss deep, personal things. I don't want to find myself in the position of a free therapist either. I don't want to go through the ""thick and thin"" and I don't want to pull anyone else through it either. If something's too big to handle alone, there's professionals of all sorts to help. I just cannot handle the responsibility of someone else's problems on top of my own. Let's not even go into the conflicts and disagreements and the anxiety attached. Those times when you see a notification and your pulse spikes, and you wonder if this is how it's supposed to be.

To those who can handle it, I applaud you. I'm just too weak for that."

I am socially anxious but I’ve learned to talk to people albeit with difficulty.

I also support my family working to help my ALS stricken step father and my mother who is physically disabled but can still get around often. 

I’ve tried asking out women to the point of being a gentleman but nobody will give me a chance. (I might be bicurious although women are more attractive.)

They are fine with ruining the lives of people for minor acts or perceived slights against them and minority groups. MeToo was dangerous the minute people who supported them said men or people accused of sexual misconduct should be fired or imprisoned without evidence. But this doesn't just apply to them. Many groups in modern day have taken to demanding extreme justice as if they want to be woke vigilantes. They all seem to have so much empathy, but not enough heart to apply it to both sides. They care about other people so much, but don't use their mind to control their emotional responses. 

This all makes them dangerous because the people who grow up with this kind of influence will one day have a chance to run the country. They will force everyone to wear a mask to hiding who they really are and walk carefully as though dealing with children. When they finally reach the government they will discover all kinds of tricks and trips to punish society and force this Social Justice mind set on everyone.

TL:DR - Woke groups who demand change to better the lives of others don't understand how their methods hurt society more than it helps."

It breaks my heart every single time. She tells me her cousins are mean to her. She comes home dirty, with discharge in her genitals. He lets her stay up late, constantly has people coming over despite of the pandemic, and has parties every weekend where he gets drunk even while my daughter is there. I feel he is putting me at risk (asthmatic & crohns) by constantly having people over. My daughter saw an ad for alcohol & says “look it’s daddy’s drink”. A family member told me they saw him at the store, & she was just running around and sitting on the floor while he was in a different aisle on his phone. He also no longer allows me to call her while she’s with him. Anytime I try to discuss any of this, he tells me I’m harassing him or manipulating our daughter.
 
When she comes home, she acts out & has nightmares. It usually takes her a few days to act normal again. I’ve contacted DCF, multiple lawyers, but all tell me the same thing. Nothing can be done. I agreed to split custody trying to be a good mom, & regret my decision every day. This sucks & I feel like I’ve failed my daughter."

I was happy to try and limit myself to my small circle of friends at that age, because I was aware that I wasn't one of the popular kids and didn't want the awkwardness of trying to fit in or from being laughed at for whatever awkward thing I did.

This would have been fine, but unfortunately there were a few who weren't content in ignoring me and seized upon my awkwardness for mockery and continuous bullying, especially during my last two years at the school. It wasn't physical, but mental. There were 3 main ones, and 2 or 3 others who would occasionally join in. It mostly seemed to consist of making me feel uncomfortable through making silly noises around me, and inferring that was me (I didn't even make noises), through invading my personal space, rubbing my back and squeezing my arms. They would grab my collar and shake it while making their silly noises and try to wind me up with their comments. On my birthday when waiting for class they sang happy birthday loudly, getting everyone's attention, and then mimicked pelvic thrusts on me, embarrassing me. Once they took photos of me without consent and one asked ""is this going on the geeks or freaks section?"" I also had bad acne, which didn't help with my self-confidence, and one would rub a friend's tie on my spotty back. All of this made me feel insecure and picked on.

Ok, none of it was anything like getting beaten up every day, but it happened regularly and made me feel upset and bullied. I am not a vindictive person, so if any of the culprits apologised to me sincerely then I would forgive them. They haven't, so until then they're dead to me. One did try adding me on Facebook; I rejected him. I have no idea if he would have apologised through that, but I didn't want to make it seem like he is forgiven, and he could have said sorry before if he wanted to.

What made things worse is that no-one who didn't bully me would say anything. They would either say nothing or in some cases laugh along. When someone who was at least polite or kind to me spoke to them as friends I felt a sense of betrayal. I didn't get why I deserved to be picked on or why no-one said anything, like it was ok what was happening to me. The worst was when someone who would be friendly would laugh though. I had a friend in chemistry who I could get on with, but once the three of them started invading my space and pushed me back while making 'witty' comments aimed at winding me up. I looked at my friend for help and noticed she was giggling. When she noticed me she covered her mouth, but her eyes gave it away that she could only suppress the laughter. I never mentioned it afterwards, but it did make me feel small when someone I thought of as a friend saw something which made me feel miserable not only not intervene, but think of it as a funny moment.

All this is in the past now, thankfully. When I went to sixth form college (for the benefit of non-Brits, sixth form is the two years before university when you sit A levels, which are used for entry to university. Most are part of the secondary school, but some sixth form colleges are separate to schools. In my hometown all secondary schools cease at GCSE, so every student goes to the sixth form college if they want to pursue A levels.) things improved massively. It had more students, and none of my former bullies were in the same classes, so I could avoid them. I used it as an opportunity to improve my confidence and it was the start of such. I have only improved from then on and now you wouldn't think I was the socially awkward, shy and bullied kid at age 16. Their attempts to pick on me reduced and it only happened a couple of occasions at the college and was not like before.

It has had an effect on me since, I get occasional dwellings on such, but I can deal with it without it impacting my mood. What gets me is the thoughts of my current friends I've made through university, and especially my girlfriend, if they were at my school. I shouldn't do, but I wonder what they would have done if they were there. I can't imagine them joining in, but I wonder if they would have been one of those who said nothing or maybe laughed along. Maybe that's unfair of me, because they're good people, but many of those who didn't do anything in my class would see themselves as such.  So, I get hurt imagining them being one of my classmates who did nothing and befriended my bullies.

And it is my girlfriend I am most bothered about. She's been great since we've been together (5 years now), we've been through a lot. She's helped with my anxiety disorder and I have been there for her when her mum died. We've been through a lot and I feel content settling down with her. I don't keep meaningful secrets from her, apart from this, because it embarrasses me. She knows I wasn't a popular kid, but I've always said I wasn't bullied through the shame. I have struggled to bring myself to though, because it hurts me too much. I would have it forever etched in my mind that she could be one of those who did and said nothing or worse, regardless of the rationality of it.

I know she would say that she wouldn't, and I believe she would be honest in what she thinks she would have done. I just think that many which stood by would say the same to their partners if they opened up to being bullying, because they are human and the bystander effect. I know it's pointless going through this thought, because nothing can be done, she wasn't there and I shouldn't worry about hypotheticals. However, the nature of it has hurt me deeply. I have nightmares where my giggling friend's face is replaced by my girlfriend's giggling face as my bullies torment me.

It's these wonderings which hurt me the most now. I don't want to tell all, because there's no need. I don't want to tell my parents, because there's nothing they can do now, and I don't want to sadden them. I want to tell my girlfriend though, when I feel the time is right, because I need to get it off my chest. I feel that speaking things through with her would rid myself of the shame and hurt, especially over how I wonder whether she'd have been a bystander. It might help start the process of moving on for good.

I am pleased I have spoken out on here, so it is no longer a complete secret to the world, even if those reading are strangers. It feels good to just spill out something which has dragged me down in my mind for over a decade."
knsl52,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knsl52/humanities_degrees_are_valuable_stop_comparing_us/,Humanities degrees are valuable. Stop comparing us to STEM graduates.,6,6,1609430728.0,"Long story short, I have relatives who are confused why I'm having a hard time looking for a proper job. They all went to college (not university) to study practical programs, and they were able to get a job relatively quickly. I'm the only one who went to university, but I studied a humanities program (not gender studies, in fact I studied a combination of foreign languages, policy, and philosophy). The fact of the matter is that humanities degrees are simply not as profitable from the onset, and often times its basically treated by the job market like a high school diploma. But, of course, in truth, it isn't any less valuable, the humanities is basically the study of how we organise as a society, it's how we create order out of nothing, art is valuable, philosophy is valuable, language is valuable, and policy is valuable, without these things society would collapse.

It's just very upsetting that my relatives can't grasp the fact that there are people out there like myself who aren't STEM-inclined, and that means we are not going to have your typical formulated career path, on the contrary we end up in jobs that is vaguely related to our background. I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to make use of what I have learned, but its really difficult right now, especially with the pandemic. It's just upsetting to be compared to STEM graduates all the time. It hurts."

knrwhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knrwhr/i_was_involved_not_the_victim_in_a_child_grooming/,"I was involved (not the victim) in a child grooming case. I found out some info about it today, six years later.",5,2,1609428463.0,"(Cw : no graphic descriptions, but mentions of child grooming)
In my final year of high school (2014) me and my friend group were ‘pretty good friends’ with a new teacher. He was quite young as far as the teachers in our school went(26-27) and because he was new to the school, we showed him around and sat in his room at lunchtime because he gave us somewhere to stay when we didn’t want to go outside, and he was friendly and helped us with our coursework. 

My friend group consisted of five girls including myself. Me and two of the girls (N and T) were quite shy, we didn’t say so much and got on with work, I joined in with the jokes, but didn’t do much. Two of my friends, (K and J) were a lot more confident. They took the affection from a young, male teacher and decided that they had crushes on him. He made the odd YouTube video in the easily approachable socially awkward ukulele man persona, which they found and watched and spoke about and acted like they were a secret, but he joined in. He laughed with them and showed them things that were too personal for a teacher to show students. He showed them his YouTube videos and his dogs and his family, and once even went as far as to show them where he lived. We lived in a small ish town, so we knew the areas well. 

They made sure to walk past his house on their route back from school, and they did all of the usual things that teenagers do when they have a crush on a teacher, but his reciprocation made us uncomfortable. K was more into him than J, they acted like they were together in all ways except physical when we were in his room for breaks. They flirted with eachother very obviously, and J backed off. Again, because we were all children and didn’t know that it was horrifically inappropriate. 

We had our leavers prom, and because we were supposedly friendly with him, we fired him an email asking where he was. Every other teacher was there, it was weird that he wasn’t there. He said he wasn’t coming, and to stop contacting him. None of us knew what was wrong with him, so obviously we were a bit hurt by it. 

A month after leaving school, I got a phone call from the police asking me to come to the station, I went down and I was asked questions regarding specifically my relationship with him. I told them truthfully, nothing physical happened with him, nothing at all with me happened with him other than he was a bit more friendly than a teacher should be.  
The police made it very clear that one of the girls in my friend group had been groomed by him. I am unsure as to the extent of the grooming, but it was still grooming. We all assumed it was K, because she was the most forward with him and it made the most sense for it to be her. We didn’t really speak much after that because we went to different colleges and drifted naturally.

It was all forgotten about, until a Twitter meme went around today. The post was about weird traumatic stuff that happened in high school, and I made a vague post regarding being called into the police station for my nonce teacher, and I got a message of J. She opened up to me and said that she didn’t say anything before because she didn’t want me to think anything bad about her and she felt bad for not telling any of her friends because it was too much to deal with. She hadn’t opened up on any of the specifics of what happened, which is completely understandable, but hearing about it made me feel so weird. 
She was one of the only people of the group that I still speak to, and not knowing and making offhand comments about it (not jokes, just ‘remember when’) feels so strange. 
It’s all buried now and the teacher has been suspended and I’m pretty sure he’s been arrested too, but having it all dredged up is so bizarre. I wasn’t a victim in the case by any means, but knowing that was going on without me being aware is absolutely soul destroying. 
I’m not looking for advice necessarily, just getting it all out"

I apologised and tried to clean it up and make it right and he keeps screaming about how thoughtless I was and if I just wiped the bottom of the mug or stopped overfilling things it wouldn’t have happened. I started trying to defend myself saying it was an accident, I didn’t understand why I was getting shouted at when he could have sat down and spoken to me calmly about how serious and precious it was etc. I admit I was overreacting but I get shouted at often and I’m really tired of it. My stepmum came in and treated me like a child (I am 18), asking what she would have said to me if she had spilt tea on my things (after I had already apologised profusely) to which I responded that I would be told that I am irresponsible with my things and shouldn’t have left it there and she got angry with me for ‘being disrespectful’. I feel really upset because my stepsister (17) never gets yelled at and she literally has a fake ID and goes out drinking all the time. I feel like I have to tread on eggshells at my dads house and be this perfect person because every time I do anything they don’t approve of I’m made fun of or told off. - but they don’t seem to approve of anything I do. I get told off for spending all day in my room revising for my exams, but when I do come downstairs they say I sit funny, I don’t watch TV or films properly (I have to use my phone at the same time because i have trouble concentrating due to mental illness), I’m too grumpy (because I am so uncomfortable). My stepsister never gets told off for anything, at least that I’ve seen, and she does a lot of the same things that I do during the day. I work so hard for school to try and get them to be happy with me and it never feels like enough. My grades have slipped because of the lockdown and I feel like I’m a failure. I can’t live solely at my mums house either because she is either working full time or drinking and being nasty to me. My life has been like this since I was 5 years old. I don’t know how I’m going to make it to university at this rate. I just feel like the joke, the mistake, the one no one wanted. But i feel like I am making a big deal out of things and I should be happy that I have a nice house, they buy me nice things, go to a good school etc. I just feel guilty for being alive and in the way 24/7. :("

I’ve been terrible with keeping conversation, frightened of being introduced to girls that I find attractive and so shit at trying to move past the friendly stage and actually flirt that it becomes embarrassing and it’s normally used as ammunition to take the piss out of me by my friends.

I live with my best friend (M26) who’s had his GF staying with us on and off for last 2 months. His older brother (M28) also lives with us and his GF is now staying as well. This has just made me feel even more depressed and insecure about the fact it’s been so long for me. I sometimes hear both couples in bed at night if I don’t have my TV on loud which has affected my sleep quality. I used to be able to go to sleep without any podcast or Netflix etc. Letting my thoughts just drift, now my my thoughts race and I end up needing some sort of distraction to fall asleep to.

I tend to play games to distract myself from this but doing things with my mate rarely ever happens anymore unless it’s with his GF as well. Watching movies with both couples is so depressing cause I can hear them kissing, whispering etc. Like normal couple stuff which I get (don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t want them to stop showing each other affection) but given I’ve spoken to my mate about my issues and confided in him about how I want to find someone but I’m super anxious and sensitive about it, I thought he’d be different.

I’m really looking forward to moving to London soon and starting again but I have a few months until then and my short term MH is being affected. 

Not sure what I’m wanting from this post but I can’t exactly tell my best-mate what I’m thinking so just wanting to vent really I guess. Happy to hear people’s thoughts and advice."

knqzps,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knqzps/my_parents_have_a_toxic_relationship/,My parents have a toxic relationship,2,0,1609425268.0,"Never talked about this before. My parents both teachers (my father has 2 degrees, mun ""just"" one), no financial problems, 3 houses, always traveling around the word, living in a free country (italy) have a toxic relationship. 
I know that they met when my dad was like 31 (now 54) and my mom 35 (now 58) and I always had the feeling that I happened (22, F), I wasn't planned. They got married when she was pregnant. My grandmother this summer told me that she was scared when my said to be pregnant, she wasn't happy.

Growing up i saw my dad being violent many times to my mom, to me and other people: I could never forget when he throw in the air a bowl with hot broth, which hit me near the ear and burnt my skin... I tried to forget and forgive many of these situation but even if you go past that they leave an invisible groove into you. 

Moreover, my father has been cheating on my mom (last 5 years), my mom knows as well but we don't have evidence. 
When he is free he spends all of the afternoon with ""a"" friend, a friend that is saved on his telephone as ""panda"" or ""cheese"" (whereas I'm just saved with my name)... this friend is a guy, 10 years younger, and my father is apparently heterosexual. They text all day long, my father sends him photos of everything he eats.
The fact that he is cheating on my mom with a man is not a problem, it would be as bad with a woman, the problem is that he uses that as an alibi. Sometimes to remark that he is heterosexual he says things like ""gay people are evil, i know many of them and they are bad""...  

At home there is always a cold war climate, we can't talk during the news otherwise he starts screaming... I obviously want them to divorce but my mom is too scared about my father's revenge.
I don't know what to do, I love my mom so much and I can't continue like this. 

I'm mad because I don't have any control, I can't divorce from them and I'm living my life scared about things that could happen, I'm mad cause we are in Italy not in an oppressive society against divorce, I'm mad cause they have money to pay lawyers yet I can't convince them."
knqzpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knqzpp/im_tired_of_being_me/,I'm tired of being me,2,7,1609425268.0,"I have CPTSD, recently diagnosed.  Its explained away a lot of my problems but now I'm left in a weird limbo.   I now know why I am the way I am, but the damage has already been done.  

For nearly 30 years I've struggled with what I thought was depression and told was anxiety by putting on this smiling face and lying my ass off.  'Yeah everything is great', ' I'm fine, lets talk about you instead' and overcompensating for my shitty self esteem by being what I thought everyone wanted me to be.   People correctly assumed I'm fake or a flake. Because I was.  I was spread so thin trying to be this perfect person and prove to people I'm worthy of their friendship.  Which I could never get because I was faking every moment of my happiness.  And not very well apparently. 

It led to being taken advantage of a lot, being stolen from, assumed to be dumb.. which I put up with because I craved acceptance in any form.   It was so exhausting trying to be what everyone wanted me to be that eventually I crashed and crashed hard into self destruct mode.  I couldnt understand how life just came so easily to everyone else while I struggled.  I became very depressed for a long time and still... nobody cared.   I get it now.  But before my diagnosis I felt crazy. Worthless.  I didnt want to exist.  It's hard to explain just how deep, hopeless and dark my life felt and still feels sometimes.  Thank you, Childhood Trauma, Neglect and Abusive Relationships.

This being a small place with smaller minds and long memories... it's been quite the journey.  I struggle a lot with wanting to explain why I am the way I am knowing nobody cares.  I feel like I've been freed from a cage only to be trapped in a smaller one. I have an amazing therapist,  1 person who truly gets me and my kids.  That's it.  No other close relationships including to my parents.  No siblings or close relatives.

Its lonely.  I appreciate what I do have ( my partner & children ) but it so dambed lonely sometimes.   CPTSD still makes me do things I dont want to do so I hesitate making new relationships because I feel these will end the same way as all the others.  And I'm not complaining.  I understand why my situation is what it is only too well.  Doesn't help that even today I'm so socially awkward it's often literally uncomfortable.  

I just wish it could have been different. Even knowing that most of these people are not good people for what they've done to myself or others...

  I still just wish I could go back in time and tell that kid itll be ok.   To stop being everything everyone wants and just be herself.  Maybe she wouldn't be so lonely and lost today.

Thanks for reading."

knqu7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knqu7o/struggling_with_my_sexuality_but_thankful_for_my/,Struggling with my sexuality but thankful for my gf,1,0,1609424675.0,"I'm considerably younger than my gf (shes 30 and I'm 22). She's the first person I've ever been with sexually, and we've definitely had a lot of fun. She has plenty more physical experience than me, and weve dated almost 2 years, so I've definitely picked up a few tricks.

With that being said, I definitely think I'm a sex/porn addict. I constantly think about sex, which makes me feel guilty, because it is often thoughts with other people. I don't ever want to cheat on/hurt my girlfriend, we've built SUCH a good life together.

A while ago, my girlfriend asked if I would be interested in opening up our relationship. I was VERY hostile about it, and pulled the ""am I not good enough for you yada yada"" stuff. My girlfriend said she shouldn't have brought it up and wont do it again.

Shes always been a very sexual person (she has a very high body count, not that I care at all) and has slept with pretty much every friend she has, male or female. I began to realize none of that stuff bothers me, because she's very respectful of my boundaries in that regard.

She'll go through phases where she really doesn't want to have sex, and she urges me to have sex with other people. I would tell her I didn't want to do that, because I wouldn't want her to sleep with other people, and she told me she had her fun in her 20's and she has no interest in seeing other people because she knows it would bother me, she just felt bad ""not being able to satisfy me"" so she wants me to know that as long as I communicate it with her, I can see other people.

I was very uncomfortable with that at first, and I told her that, and she was very cool about it and never brought it up again. However, I've been getting intense sexual urges and very curious about other people. I don't want to commit to anyone else at all, but I admit that I am interested in experiencing other people physically.

I sat down my gf like 6 months after we had that conversation, and I talked about it with her. She was very cool with it, but I told her I wouldn't be comfortable if our relationship had an imbalance where I got to see anyone she approved of, but she couldn't see anyone, so we discussed and agreed on some boundaries/ground rules.

1. If we have a threesome, it has to be someone we both agree on. If either party is unsure its a nogo period.
2. Swinging is awesome as long as we approve of both members of the other couple.
3. No talking about the sex we have with other people/ no comparisons.
4. We MUST be in constant communication about what is happening. If we sleep with someone without the other persons approval, its cheating.
5. Until I'm more comfortable, we both have to get laid at the same time if it's with other people, which is why I'm more interested in swinging/threesomes.
6. If anyone is uncomfortable, we drop it. No debates/complaints. We stay each other's priority. Whether it is a person, or the entire relationship as a whole. If one of us decides we don't like the openness, we close it back up.

I'm kind've excited to experiment with my sexuality, and I am really grateful to have my girlfriend. She is so open minded, and although shes excited to sleep with other people (she's never had a relationship that would be ok trying it), shes more excited that I get to experience other people. I am more interested in experiencing people WITH her (threesome/swinging) and she is too. It's just something special I feel makes me love my girlfriend even more.

With that being said, I don't think I would have any problems closing it off if I needed. Sex is good (addictingly good), but I've also gone months without having sex with my girlfriend (she has ptsd and around a certain time of year shuts off sexually). before, and I know that although we have great sex, my feelings for her and my heart are not in my dick. I just don't know where else I could find a relationship like this.

TL:DR: Gonna try opening up my relationship with my girlfriend. It was her idea and I hated it at first, and she was cool about it. I brought it back up and we are gonna try it and I'm super excited. 

Sorry for sounding like a mouth-foaming horny teen. Just wanted to talk about it but didn't wanna bug my friends. "

Don't spam me with insults because whatever you have to say to me I've probably already said it to myself.

I (14M) have violent and lustful fantasies all the time, they aren't unusually gross or like BDSM but they're immoral and violent, I'm repulsed and ashamed by them but they're more intriguing than normal fantasies. I know everyone has this but mine are seriously fucked up, I would be instantly disowned by everyone I know if they knew what I think about. 

I torture insects, like holding a lighter under a taped-over glass with a spider in whenever I've caught one, to watch it panic and struggle, I used to collect dead wasps, I tried to kill some geese today with a hunting slingshot (failed). 

I laugh in bad situations, not in like a ""oh it's all I can do. I'll try to make light of it. It's a coping mechanism"", it's none of that shit, it's a menacing laugh, like when my friend died of cancer at 13 I thought it was a shame but I didn't cry and I just got on with my day, and when I saw everyone else in tears I started smiling and had to stop myself from laughing, I tried to hide it but someone pointed it out and everyone looked at me spitefully as if I'd just murdered a baby. Whenever my mum is in tears because she's worried about my mental health I start laughing. Whenever my mum accidentally hurts herself I laugh at her (like I do find it funny) while my step sister asks if she's ok. I laughed at a rape story on Reddit today and now I want to kill myself.

I don't think I'm a sociopath, I figure that at sociopaths tend to be stupid, arrogant, and egotistical, and I can admit when I'm at fault, plus I hate bullying and manipulation, I don't manipulate because I haven't had any need to, but if someone is manipulated cleverly I admire it and if something terrible happens in my life I'll also admire it and find it funny, because it's like something ""good in quality"" that would happen in a movie or smth, that's the best way I can word it. 

I have a lot of destructive hobbies like spend a lot of my time burning stuff and I'm slowly building an arsenal of weapons (so far I have: lighters and deodorant, a compound bow, a hunting slingshot, a hunting knife, a baseball bat, a maglite torch, an axe and I think that's it so far, I plan on getting a refillable lighter and today as I was playing round with a spiked pole I got the idea of getting/making a spear). 

I find gore satisfying, I watch loads of videos of people dying (again I know that's fairly normal), sometimes when I see someone I imagine them being hoisted up by a noose or me shooting them with a shotgun (but not so much anymore), at one point I had violent fantasies about classmates (which, again, aren't so common anymore) see my first post for more info, also I know I'll never do a school shooting or someone similar because it's pathetic and unoriginal, if I was going to kill someone I'd have to make it memorable and fucked up, but I'd never do that because of prison and my family would despise me and it'd fuck them up mentally. I think I might be autistic, idk what's wrong with me, any suggestions?"

I got undressed. Sat down Stuck the barrel of my rifle into my mouth and pulled the trigger.

I tossed the gun away turned on the shower and sat in there crying until my friend found me.
She held my naked pathetic ass in that shower until I passed out. She dried me off and tucked me into bed. She never spoke of it after that.

I had been financially ruined by my then ex fiance who was cheating on me. My mother was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. I had a shit job with no prospects. I was in a bad place.

In the last 2331 days I have.

Fallen in love.

Took my first plane ride.

Moved to another state

Got engaged

Broke up

Moved back home

Found my purpose in life

Went back to school

Got my driver's license

Started a business

Got my associates degree

Tool up jewelry making

Ran my business into the ground

Got into my dream school

Bought my first car



I did all that and more. I have met wonderful people and friends. I have done things I never thought I would and gone places I never imagined.

This month I celebrated Christmas with my mother who has been in remission for five years. 

Next year I will finish my bachelor's degree with my masters not far behind.


I got a second chance at life because of a bullet manufactured in turkey 70 years ago failed quality control.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that sometimes you just need to get through that bad moment in time to come out the other side. Life can get better.


Edit - I didn't want to reply to each message that i wanted to reply to soo instead this update will do.


I didn't expect this to explode like it did. Its been a rough year and last night i felt the urge to share this. I gave my rifle back to my father after this happened, i didn't think it wise to have the temptation there for me on a bad day. 
Life hasn't been easy honestly its been more failure than success. Thank you all for your messages of encouragement im glad that this helped some of you. The thing that has really stuck with me since that day is that i am capable of pulling the trigger, so anytime i feel that poison weed of depression wrap itself around my heart i start reaching out to people, because i know exactly what i can do. So if anyone is struggling i encourage you to reach out to someone."

And I'm not talking about the cooperation and helping the weakest and supporting the group, because obviously that were the values that made humans progress as civil beings.
I'm talking about the modern kindness, where the weakest gets immunity against all criticism. Leading to the weak stays weak and strong skilled people gets frustrated. Think about it, when did we start to glorify and romanticize the weaknesses, like mental illnesses and suicide?
Yes we should sympathize with those but there is a fine line between empathy and glorifying and holy shit we crossed it.
Why can't tell a stupid person that he is stupid in his face? What is more beneficial for humanity? Not hurting the stupid person feelings? Or telling the truth for that person so he may try to be better? 

And then let's look at weak people themselves, everyone mistakenly think those people need help, and that's right but for how long? 
Weak people often find their comfort zone in weakness and they feed on others' empathy and help, always needing more. They are the most perfect manipulative personalities. 
 
If you are smart enough to not get caught in the trap of ""kindness and empathy"", then weak people are the perfect mirror for your own weaknesses. You will see your own weaknesses in them and hate them and yourself. 

There is no compromise with such people, you can't help someone who doesn't want to help himself. You just need  step back and  walk away with no intention to return. Because if you stayed you will get nothing but your energy drained by someone who would never change. 
If you have the basic human skills like being independent and the will to raise above your problems and always following the instincts of being stronger as a human, then weak people are not your game. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your life."

I'm gonna sit in the bedroom and probably cry all night thinking of 2020. I experienced too many emotions during this year and it's hard.
I'm writing this post hoping I will get some strength from you guys on reddit. I hope I will enter 2021with different mindset. Im trying to think of the positive things that happened in my life. I'm trying to believe that loneliness is for me and this is what I have chosen long time ago when I was rather isolated than socially magnetic. I'm daydreaming and this is what keeps me afloat very often. In my past I travelled almost 2 years completely alone meeting on my way random people with whom I shared my best moments and made some meaningful memories. But now I'm just burned by romantic relationships, jobless and tired of hoping for real happiness. 
I'm physically healthy, I applied for some job positions and that's what gives me hopes. Kind of excited of new year but also scared af.
Well, now I'm going to kick back and relax on the park bench and watching what's going on around me.
Why the world is so beautiful but so sad at the same time?

I'm wishing you an amazing new year's eve, no matter if you spend this day alone or with others live the moment with an open heart and be your own best friend.

knop1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knop1m/im_using_this_to_write_out_my_thoughts/,I’m using this to write out my thoughts,1,0,1609415448.0,"I normally make a new account to do this, if you’re one of the people who’s always on here just helping people, you’re really awesome and I want the best for you in life.

This is going to be very vague. 

I hope you feel no pain, I hope you’re able to move on and forget about it. I wish I could take any pain you’re experiencing if you are. 

If you feel anything negative, I want to experience it times 100. 

You don’t deserve to feel sad, you deserve happiness for the rest of your life. But I can’t control that, and that’s the worst part. 

If I was apart of your pain, like if it’s my fault, or I’m apart of it, I’m so fucking sorry. I’m so sorry. I can’t take back anything, nobody can, but please don’t feel this way. Please. I hope there’s a god and it takes care of you. I will burn in hell and experience   nothing but torture and suffering if it means you can have peace with your life. 

I know I’m not evil, because I feel this way, but I can’t help but feel like I am. Nobody should ever have hurt you. I’ll slice my shit up if. I’m just gonna do it. 

I can’t forgive myself. Everyone tells me to, but the thought that it might linger with you just kills me inside and I’m so fucking sorry. I can’t take it back I can’t take it back, but please be strong and move forward. Please be happy with yourself, you’ve done nothing wrong, you don’t deserve to feel sad if you do, you don’t deserve pain if you have it. 

I’m don’t deserve to know whether you do or don’t. All I can do is be a good person from now on and make sure I don’t hurt anyone ever again, because I’ll break my fucking face on the pavement if I ever do it again. I’m not kidding I’ll slam my fucking head into the concrete if I find out you’re sad. I know it won’t fix you, but please let me be selfish. You don’t have to be sad. Please don’t be sad, please, please try and be happy, please find the strength. Holy shit. Idk what else to say, I’m not magic, I’m a fucking asshole. 

I really wish they let me die, the people who tell me to move on and that it’s ok. I wish they would let me fucking die because I’m too damn weak to live with myself. 

I’m being held up by family and friends, people who care so much about me and I just sulk. Pathetic worthless piece of shit who doesn’t deserve to do good. They tell you you have to though. I can’t be stuck like this. I have to move forward myself as well. I have to. I don’t care what happens to me. So I’ll do it for them. Please think of them. Please let it drive you to be better. 

Dying would be way easier though, it would make them so sad though. And I hate that. I really wish they’d hate me. I wish they. 

I have to breath, I have to clear my head, please be stronger. 

WAKE THE FUCK UP

I ignore it though, I hear him in my head, there’s gotta be at least 4 of me by now. 

One of them I fucking hate, and is the reason for everything that’s wrong. I fucking hate you so much. 

One of them is the me right now, I’ll call him justice, this one, I’m mixed about, he does nothing but hurt me but only because I deserve it. I ask him for advice on certain things that would require his expertise. Anything that requires justice, I bring him out.

There’s the other one, the feeler you. He does nothing but cry and care for others. He’s your empathy, your humanity, your, he’s necessary. Without him you are stuck at the one you hate, without this one you are trash. Pathetic trash without this one, seriously without this one I would’ve killed you already, you’re so lucky he lets you cry and care about people now. I promise you if you didn’t have this I would’ve killed me already. 

And then there’s him, that guy, the one who is above all of these, well not right now at least, he’s the one that yelled wake up. I have him locked away right now, I’m not letting you move forward until you’re ready. I don’t want you to feel like him yet, happy, confident, excited, happy. This one gets so much work done you wouldn’t believe it, a machine this one, is nothing but good vibes and work. Calm, collected. So fucking calm when you get to be him. Care free, nothing can go wrong, no stress no nothing. Just existing and living. I like this one the most, it’ll help me with my goals.

Don’t worry, I can’t kill you yet, we have work to do still me. When I say you or him, I’m talking about myself. In the third person. Yea. 

The doctor says you’re fine, idk if they saw this though, this part of you. Because whether you like it or not, we are all you. Everything those are, is all you. You aren’t just them sometimes and sometimes not, that’s just you. That’s why the doctors say nothing is wrong, you don’t let the others talk out loud. I guess there’s a 5th one 

I’ll call him public image, this is who you show to strangers and when you need to be on your best behavior with your friends friends. He has nothing on his mind mostly, just the conversation.  Very self aware this one is, if his face looks a way, he notices and fixes it. He doesn’t show the sad ones or the scary ones to anyone he shouldn’t, and if it does slip, he makes sure to fake yawn or something like that. 

I’m bored now, who is this one? I guess this is your boredom, he doesn’t care about much, just wants shit to be done with. I don’t like him, me, right now, my immediate emotions are getting me “angry” at myself. This is what I think we’re split, there’s different answers to even my conscious mind, why is there so much arguments and hold ons. Why can’t I just be a set person like everyone else

I’m really done now bye"

I know this probably won't get read by 99% of you but I figure what matters is getting stuff off my chest. I don't wish to go into great detail about myself so for the sake of brevity I am a lazy, depressed doomer that has suffered from porn addiction for the past 3 and a half years.

I have essentially ruined my life but I haven't quite given up hope just yet. I have spent many years of my life hoping I could stumble upon something by random that would make me happy and fantasize about it. Only thing is that never ever happens and I get even more depressed. I have also used my dark traumatic past as a crutch/shield and not really take personal responsibility for my short-comings. So let's get into the things I want to achieve within the next 52 weeks.

# 1. No more porn and masturbation

Porn and masturbation were my only sources of happiness I have had for the past 3 and a half years. I have spent hours on end satisfying myself just to keep the dark thoughts away. It has come at the expense of my social life and academic success. So I want to make it official and put an end to it. No more porn. No more masturbation. Cold turkey

# 2. No more internet addiction

Since I was 10, the internet has been used to fight of the loneliness/anxiety I have been suffering from. It gave me the illusion that I am having a great time. It has gotten to the point where I watch any video just for the sake of feeling companionship and I force myself to laugh at any comedy-related video just to make myself believe I am happy. Just like my porn addiction it has cost me my social life and my studies. So there. I am going to restrict my time spent skiving around on the internet just to make me feel better. Sorry Cr1tikal and Muta. Thanks for the years of making me laugh.

# 3. No more self-victimization

I went through quite a fair bit of trauma/abuse form my childhood. I kind of realize that I use it as a crutch/shield whenever I screw something up in my life. For instance, I go ""Oh man. If my mom didn't hit and scream at me so much, maybe I wouldn't be addicted to the internet to make me happy."" So I want it to come to a stop. I am a grown-ass adult and I need to take responsibility for my actions and learn from my mistakes. Matter of fact I need to stop giving myself a hard time for screwing something up and actually learn from it so I don't screw up again. So there. No more self-victimization.

# 4. Living in the here and now

I realize that my mind keeps replaying dark scenarios from my past and it has distracted me from the things that really matter. It has also made me think about dark, toxic stuff that hasn't happened yet such as imagining people are mocking and denigrating me behind my back. I also realize that I fantasize about an unrealistically happy future (I'm talking levels that would make cheesy Hollywood writers blush) that I wouldn't have to work for because I would stumble upon it by pure dumb luck and everything would be hunky dory. That is yet another thing I need to stop. Yes, I want to have a bright future and yes, I have to earn it. The only way I can do that is living in the here and now and focus and the things that actually truly matter.

# 5. Bettering myself

I often fantasize about a girl that would love and care for me and if I don't love myself who would ? And what is the best way to love yourself ? Bettering myself. I want to live each day better than my last and be the best version of myself I can be. I want to give myself a reason to respect myself than I did a little more than the day before and hopefully snowball that into being a stronger, smarter and happier person than I was yesterday. There are a few things I want to attain by the December 31 2021.

# 6. Things I want to attain by December 31 2021

* Passing the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) exam
* Be decent at programming languages and shell-scripting
* Develop a decent understanding of networking
* Understand basic Windows and Linux administration
* Get a physically attractive body (Basically work-out, eat healthy and put on muscle. If there are any height-boosting exercises let me know haha).
* Get at least 2 new friends.

That's about all the resolutions I have for 2021. I hope to come back with all the above accomplished and ultimately be a healthier and happier person. See you guys in 52 weeks. Hopefully whoever reads this accomplishes their 2021 resolutions as well.  

Take care and god speed :)

I love working with them even though it can be stressful at times. I know there are thousands of children in the foster care in my state (including several that are my students). However, after researching the foster care system, I've concluded it would be best for me to serve these children as an educator, and maybe becoming an advocate at a later date.

The problem is, I still really want to raise one child. None of my friends do. It doesn't make any logical sense. It's super expensive, time-consuming, and challenging. The planet already has almost 8 billion people on it and I don't have any special traits to pass on. I would just care and teach the child the best I can with my husband and encourage him or her to make positive choices to improve the planet. Really, I could do a lot more good by donating my money and time to those in need, right?

Does anyone else struggle with these feelings? I'm the only one in my friend group that wants to raise a kid and I feel embarrassed that I want to do something that's fundamentally selfish. I would rather be in their shoes, and want to be childless! I hear about the strain on resources caused by large populations and am trying to limit my family's impact on the Earth. Sometimes it feels so complicated to exist and want to reproduce."

I’ve been on his ass about losing weight because I’ve always been so scared that I’d lose him due to his poor health. 

It all feels so stupid right now. He’s an essential worker and he’s been working this entire year because we were trying to save up and now he’s so sick. 

I’ve been trying to be calm in front of him, but my heart is breaking seeing him get worse everyday. I’ve been crying every night and I’m just so fucking scared. 

Usually he’s the person I’d talk to about this type of stuff, but I can’t because I don’t want him to be afraid. 

I’m praying that he recovers soon and takes better care of his health after doing so."

To laugh at people who to travel to Bali and talk about a spiritual experience is a privileged thing in itself. I haven't left my home country for fifteen years - I can't afford to go on holiday and I'd love to travel but I find the snobbery aimed at both people who can't travel and people who travel to certain destinations quite disheartening. Of course there are people who travel for the 'wrong' reasons and travel to places like Bali is a complex ethical issue in itself but not everyone is the same.

I dislike the disdain aimed at people who haven't left their home country either. Places like Britain, America and Japan might be among the most economically developed places in the world but they're also expensive places to live. You can be intelligent and hard-working but still be only able to cover the basics. There are plenty of 'poor' people who are respectful of and interested in different cultures, foods, languages, histories etc. but can't experience it.

I'm just posting this because somebody I respect refers to this attitude fairly frequently."

We were trying to run back to the restaurant where I had left her with her also then-boyfriend. They didn’t make it back to the hotel and when I got through to them she had taken a bad turn and he couldn’t get her under control. While scanning the streets desperately trying to find them my then-bf turns to me and says “it’s the first year I haven’t done the countdown.""

In the lift getting my friend back to her hotel room she stared into the mirror at her wine-stained mouth and said “my lips are purple like Alice’s now.”

I’ve never been a huge fan of New Years: the pressure to make it the Best Night Ever, discussing weeks in advance what all your friends are planning on doing, disappointment when the night unfolds just like Any Other Night, because that’s all it is at the end of the day. But after that year, I have never ever cared what I end up doing on this night. Last year I spent it cuddling a very large dog, just me and him and some average film on the TV. I think I fell asleep at 11.

This year obviously a lot of people don’t have a choice about how they spend New Years - lockdowns, curfews, venues closed. I know so many people will be upset or disappointed. I feel almost guilty that I can’t understand this, I feel guilty that I just don’t care myself.

Each year since that one has been different - different emotions or memories coming up, maybe one year I will party and not want to think about it, the next it hits harder. This year all I keep thinking about is how much I wish Alice was with us - how much I wish she could see us now - my other friend has a baby with someone new, someone good for her, she cycles and she gardens and she’s happy. I’m in my first relationship since the one at that time, we have our own flat and a cat. I wish more than anything she could meet my boyfriend. I know she would love him, and him her.

I have nothing profound to wrap this up with, absolutely nothing. I just wanted to scream into the void this year. 

Happy New Year, whatever that means to you. Sorry if none of this made sense."

For example, if somebody says the word ""sky,"" you'd think of the color blue, or white fluffy clouds, or various weather conditions, etc. But with these people, the associated thoughts and scenes are death, a whole lot of death, and more death. And that's an insanely massive understatement. But technically they aren't the ones who did it, they're just related to the actual perpetrators.

If I don't sufficiently hate these people, I feel like it's disrespecting the victims. But that's not how assigning blame is supposed to work from a logical standpoint. But logic isn't particularly effective here because it feels like thoughts entirely shut off if I try to push the issue, the guilt of failing to hate them sufficiently makes me remember all kinds of screwed up things until I feel horribly ill. Being able to argue with myself is already completely nuts, to also trigger physical reactions like nausea, headaches, crying, and shaking is another level of unreasonable.

If they declare war again I'm going to fucking vomit, technically that should never happen because we got nukes now but they really stress me out because they do significantly worse things than just killing people."

So 3 years ago I had heart surgery. Because of this I whenever I have any sort of dental work done I have to to tell them and get a clearance form sent to the dental office.
It’s fine, I get it. And it’s not a big deal.
Usually.
One month ago my tooth front tooth chipped where it had been filled. When I made my appointment with my normal dentist they told me it was because I needed a root canal and the filling wasn’t holding up.
They told me they did root canals but not with my insurance (I’m in US, state aid, so it’s not great.)
So! I get ahold of my insurance and am given a depressing moly small list of places to go. The first I call shouldn’t have even been on the list because they didn’t take my insurance.
Reluctantly I called the only local one. 
Dental Dreams.
It had one star reviews. But what am I gonna do.
The first time I go they have me go through a consultation. Even though I already know what’s wrong they can’t just take my word for it.
I sit in the car (they have you sit until they call you in because of covid) for almost 3 hours!!! And then they finally take me back to take an X-ray, confirm that I need what I already knew I needed and tell me to make another appointment.
I make a new appointment.
When I go to this one my heart doctors office was supposed to have already sent the medical clearance. But the hadn’t apparently. So I spent 2 hours talking to Dental Dreams and then calling my doctors office repeatedly to try to get them TO JUST FAX THE STUPID PAPERWORK BACK.
By the end of the 2 hours they still hadn’t. I was told I should probably just go and I didn’t have a lot of choices. Clearly nothing was going to get down that day.

So yesterday comes. I have yet another appointment. I have had to take off work for all 3 of these appointments (and apparently whatever future one(s) I’ll have to make now).
Listen to this insanity.
I could cry, I have never been so excited to get a root canal. I just want this disaster put behind me.
I am fucking ecstatic when they actually give me a call only a couple of minutes into waiting! Maybe this won’t be such a god awful experience!
I go on back.
The dentist and assistants are gathering supplies.
He gives me the first 2 shots of numbing agent (sorry I know it has a name, but I don’t know it). Even though it’s 2 shots, they take it out and put it back in, so it’s lots of different pokes.
Like I mentioned before, it’s one of the front teeth. Like the two very front ones? It’s number 9 if your curious and know anything about tooth placement. 
So when he’s sticking these giant needles in my mouth it’s in the very front gums and then on the other side by the roof of my mouth.
Idk why (I’ve had a lot of work done, years of addiction right fucked my teeth up) but the front of the mouth is SO painful.
It hurts like hell. But it’s okay!!!
I’m finally getting this done!! I could cry in relief.

I sit and wait while the numbing stuff does it’s thing.

The dentist comes back maybe 10 minutes later or so.
Sits down and tells me that they didn’t have cetain thing they needed (a rubber something or I don’t know to be honest I might’ve remembered if I hadn’t spiraled into shock).
I just sat for a minute like I was waiting for the punchline. Because he’s joking right?? 
He has to be. This has been a horrible experience and it’s going to be over soon, right?!?!?
No. Of course he’s not joking.
He 100% shot my face full of numbing medication and doesn’t have to proper stuff to do the procedure.

I’m not sure how I didn’t start crying right there.
So he tells me that next time he’ll see what he can do but that part of it has calcified so I may need a referral. So I tell him I’d rather have the referral now (I can’t imagine getting l ANOTHER face full of needles to be told AGAIN that he can’t do anything)

So now my tooth is still all fucked up. 
I’ve taken off 3 days of work and will need to take off more for the same damn procedure.
I’ll have to get another clearance from my heart doctor. (Which as stated above, was also a nightmare)

I have this handy little referral, I’m going to give them a call tomorrow, they’re like 2 hours away. I expect even more bullshit because none of this has gone smoothly.


I am SO tired, my tooth hurts and looks like shit. Making me feel like shit on multiple levels. 
Anyway, I really had to get this out somewhere.

I’m hella devastated. The only good part is that at least since I’m wearing a mask no one has to look at my gross fucking cracked up tooth."

I think that I spent so long ignoring my inner child and letting myself build up walls around me for protection, and I think I started doing this from a really young age. But I’ve realized so much in the past few days that in building these layers  over and over I’ve just been hurting myself. 

When you are wounded, you put a bandage on it for a while, but eventually it has to be exposed to light and air, or it won’t really get better, just worse. 

I haven’t let these hurts be exposed to light and air. And therefore, it’s hurt all the more. 

I think in 2021, I’m going to really work on healing, starting with the things that started when I was small. 

I guess I’ve realized that they run a lot deeper than I thought. I’ve forgotten how to love my inner child because I spent so much time trying to protect, being in survival mode and like literally just trying to make it to the next part. Idk, I’m just rambling at this point. I’m not really like hey New Years resolutions, but it is what it is.

I used to not be like this. Like yeah, there was some anxiety that I got from my upbringing . But after my freshman year of college, when I dated my ex, and stuff with my mom, I am completely different now. 

I used to be so different. And growth is good, like I’m glad I have the emotional intelligence I do now. 

But I feel like there are things that I have been putting off dealing with. I’ve been so afraid to grieve them. And I know that I have to.

I need to let myself heal. 

If you happen to read all of this, say a little prayer for me. Also any suggestions on how to love my inner child more?"

This is the second day in a row that DPD have attempted to deliver my package to the wrong house  at 7am in the morning, one of them was literally the house next door, everyone in my lane has a clearly labeled house, but let's say the person doesn't answer the door and they read my deliver to a safe place message, surely at this point it's quite clear, that ain't my house, but yano, let's say that that fails, we get to the 3rd option deliver to a neighbour, also nothing

Might I also add that the first time he tried to deliver to my neighbour (thinking it was me) but didn't come to my door (the neighbor on the other side is quite a while away cuz these guys are minted)

The driver has to take a photo of where he tried to deliver except the photo has been pitch black both days (well not quite) and I've barely been able to work out where he's trying to deliver so now I have to wait a week for the next delivery (new year's holiday and stuff) and if I miss that one (ofc I will if he continues like this) then I have to drive for over an hour to collect 1 bloody book, it would probably fit through my letter box, THE LETTER BOX. But if I'm wrong about all this and he has got the right house, then he's not even bothering to deliver!


I know this is small but it's really pissed me off, I've never had this problem with any deliver service before, not even yodel and I just want my parcel cuz atm I'm just £10 down (ik that may not seem like a lot but for me £10 is like big bucks)

He is a rescue with the sweetest and mildest disposition. Wednesday is a giant livestock guardian dog. We didn’t really know much about his history except that he was returned due to a dog fight at no fault of his own.

We found after a few days that he has a chronic leg injury that would lead to him being lame eventually. He is on pain medication everyday but he is mostly very mobile and happy. He chases the cat sometimes but very slowly, so he was good. 

However due to the pandemic, he had developed aggressive behaviour towards my husband, growling, barking and some stalking when he comes home and goes to work. We can only suspect that it’s a part of his instinct keeping my husband in the home was somehow his perceived job. 

I could prevent thing escalating as my dog is quite attached to me and never shown me any negative behaviours. I could call him and keep them apart. We worked with a behaviorist for three months and there was progress to the point that we felt that my husband can probably go to work without me waking up. My husband is on shift work and gets up really early and was trying to be considerate as I have my own work time too. Unfortunately, due to my husband’s week-on,week-off work schedule, I think Wednesday eventually forgot the context and ended up attacking my husband biting him 4 times on the leg and almost tackling him to bite him on the face. My husband did not need stitches but he was bleeding for 2days and had massive bruising. The night of the attack Wednesday seemed clueless that he did anything wrong even affectionately laying his head on my husband’s lap for pets. 

We have never hit Wednesday. At most we had used a stern voice. I just wanted to get that out there. We have done all positive reinforcement training, counter conditioning and desensitization, but we have failed to give him a more predictable schedule. 

I love this dog quite a lot, and am heartbroken. My husband still cares a lot about Wednesday, still walks him, still goes on car rides but no longer feel like we could keep him. My husband no longer trusts Wednesday and that’s fair and understandable. My husband even fears the future of when I go back to physically leaving the house that Wednesday’s aggression would escalate. I am also scared that the next time, my husband would get more severely injured and that would force my hand to put him down.

We decided to rehome him as a sanctuary dog in an acreage. And I want to believe that this is the best for him. That he would not get depressed at being rehomed again. Most of it is guilt. I feel bad that I have promised this being a home for the rest of his life and I cannot with good conscience fight to have him stay in our life when it is now a question of safety. I want to believe that he fits an acreage better, that having other companion dogs would enrich his life. That not being with me would make him happier in the long run.

That I will miss him terribly but in the end I have done what I could for him. I am so sad and I don’t know how to feel okay about this whole thing. I can’t eat or sleep and I feel bad wanting to keep him at the expense of my husband’s safety and being helpless and giving him up after all the good intention and love and the work to gain his trust.


I had dreaded every email replies and every phone call and wished that somehow no one will take him and we will just be forced to keep him. But that’s unfair to my husband. Tonight the animal sanctuary place called and will be booking us in for a meet and greet and I know that this makes it the final days with my Wednesday and I can’t stop crying. 

I know my problem doesn’t seem big but I don’t really know how I’m supposed to be okay."

But I'm 3 hours away from 2021 and I'm at my parents house with my sister, and my two kids and I'm hiding in the bathroom as I type this because my grief is too big to share with them right now. This is my dad's last New Years Eve. He was diagnosed with kidney failure 2 weeks ago, totally out of the blue, and his heart is too weak for any effective form of treatment.

2021 is the year my father is going to die and just thinking that takes my breath away.

In a few minutes I'll have to go out and put my son to bed then watch my daughter play her first game of Cribbage with my father, who loves the game, knowing it may be their only game. Mum, Dad and my sister are all going about their evening as usual and I just want to scream from not acknowledging the elephant in the room. We talk about it often - even joking about going to a funeral yesterday held in the hall Dad's will be in, and taking a pad and paper to jot down notes on. And Dad was so ill two weeks ago that we thought he wouldn't make it to Christmas, but once the kidney destroying meds he was on were out of his system and the new ones kicked in he started looking and acting like he was a month ago, we almost can't believe it's true, and I am so grateful for every day with him that's just normal. Except tonight, tonight I can't seem to do that.

Ok, thanks to any who've read. I really do feel lighter after getting that off my chest. Wishing you all, everything you need and plenty of what you want in the final hours of 2020 and in 2021."

I don’t need a job at the moment, both of my parents love me and I love them, I have an annoying sister whom I love, I’ve got video games and endless amounts of entertainment through phones and whatnot, my education is planned and money doesn’t seem to be a problem for me. I should be completely happy and lucky in how I am living, but emotionally I feel terrible.

With all this, certain days I feel lonely, sad, angry, self-loathing and embarrassed at myself due to how I look at my friends, how I’m slowly losing the confidence to talk to anyone or even share anything about myself. I have a friend at school who does jujitsu and tells everything she encounters, whether it may be returning to her home completely screwed or just telling me about any funny moments that occur. The more I listen to her talking, I get interested and think about joining, but I feel embarrassed or even stupid to think that I could join or talk about something else, and the situation gets awkward for me and not her. I play video games regularly and I find it hard to play without anyone I know not because that I don’t know anyone but for the fact that I don’t feel like talking to other people at any point in time, to share a laugh or any weird story(am I alone here or does everyone feel the same?). Lastly, I always think about myself and some of my friends at school. When I think of them, I always think that they are hanging out with each other and having a crazy time that I probably would enjoy, but I feel reluctant. I barely go to others’ houses and when I do its for a birthday, a family reunion or an overly organized play day. I don’t feel like I should go or ask my parents to drop me off since my mom works a bunch at the day, my dad is exhausted from night shifts and has to take care of me and my sister, and I live quite far from my friends, so I just assumed that whenever I did ask I would be refused. Whenever there’s a date to chill with other friends I feel excited to go yet I don’t feel like going.

I used to be a ongoing kid at school, but slowly I guessed I became more introverted and became to self-aware of my actions to do anything. This is probably a teenager phase but I just want to point all of my thoughts that have been lingering in my mind on this most likely forgotten and unseen post, butI do hope that finally I get to act for myself

I wish I had friends. Or at the very least a best friend. Not so much irl to hang out, because I’m not a very out going person, but someone who would text me silly things, ask how I’m doing every now and then. I have a few acquaintances that I’ll message and see how they are, wish them a good day, show genuine care for them, but I never receive it in return. I don’t always want to be the one to start the conversation but that’s what all this has turned into. And I’m just lonely for real friendships I guess.

I got close to someone who I thought was a very close best friend. Met in an online game I play with my so. I still care very much for them but I’ve been pushed aside for someone else. Lots of broken promises and lots of what comes across as making fun of me. I’m left out of almost everything and when their new friend isn’t around then I’m suddenly good enough to talk to or play with. And that hurts like hell. But I’m not the type of person to say no. So I suck it up and deal with it. 

I just wish I had someone in my life that cared for me. That would worry about my well-being or even miss me when I’m not around. Someone I have things in common with. Someone I can vent to about a game or work or home life. But I don’t think that’ll ever happen. It’s hard because I’m not in the best mental health lately either. And having someone to be able to talk to would be so nice. Anyways, sorry to blabber on. I know I have my so, but having another girlfriend to talk to would be such a joy.

We lived the last 5 years of our marriage completely miserable and avoided each other as much as we could. 

We tried therapy, but it was too little, too late, and in the end, I asked for a divorce and she agreed. We're both to blame. 

We have two daughters (15 and 18) together and I really wanted to focus on caring for them and showing them that it's possible to be happy in this life. I started dating shortly after the divorce was final, and met an amazing person and our relationship progressed very quickly. I've been very happy since meeting her and moving in with her, but I've noticed that my daughters are stuck in the ""life sucks"" phase that their mother tends to live in. They both live with their mom because they don't want to live with me and my girlfriend and her kids, which I understand. 

I feel guilty for looking for happiness in my life, and basically trading over to a whole new family to get it, while my kids now live with a parent who's always depressed and thinks the world is out to get her. Sometimes I feel like I should've just stayed there for them and found happiness in a hobby or something."

We've always been friendly but often go months or years without talking. 

After a serious tragedy in my life back in September, we started talking again and we planned a weekend for me to visit. I go and we end up having sex. She made it abundantly clear that it was casual and she had no romantic feelings for me whatsoever. I was disappointed but didn't tell her and agreed to the casual nature. 

At some point in the following weeks she referred to us as friends-with-benefits and denied that it was a one night stand.

She starts seeing another guy and our conversations drop off and the tone changed from flirty and affectionate to polite and cordial as well as occurring less frequently. Over the Christmas weekend it ended between them and she and I started talking more. The tone of our conversations did not change back. In retrospect I should have just moved on.

Tonight she texted me something about nobody wanting to sleep with her, and I told her that I wanted to. She then told me I was making her uncomfortable and that she had made herself clear about only being friends. I told her how previously she said we were friends with benefits, etc. She said that was fair enough, but now we are only friends.

I was feeling guilty for thinking our arrangement hadn't changed and embarrassed about it too. She restated her friends-only position and I, in my negative feelings, asked if she slept with me out of pity. She got very upset and ended the conversation. 

I texted her an hour later apologizing for the inappropriate final text and explained how I didn't know our arrangement had changed and that I must have been in denial of obvious facts. I apologized again and sent the text. I have yet to hear back.

I feel like i let my jealousy, fear of loneliness, and actual romantic feelings for her ruin our friendship. I am very ashamed of my words and feelings, so my plan moving forward is to exit her life out of shame. I've already deleted her number. 

I feel like even if she does forgive me then the event would always hang over the friendship and poison any positive interactions. Its not very mature, but I don't know how else to proceed."

I recently let my best friend of 10 years come and stay with me and my boyfriend for the next 2 months because she is getting ready to move to another country for work.

I love her to death and she is a wonderful person, but there is one problem. Sometimes when she drinks alcohol, she can get a little out of control and it really kills my mood. When we were younger, it was amusing and we all laughed about it the next day. But we’re both 28 now, and I’m starting to get really annoyed at the fact that she can’t control her drinking at this age.

I don’t feel like I should be responsible for having to go pick her up from wherever she is at 12:30 am like I’m her mother, but I feel like I have to because she is my friend and I should be there for her.

This doesn’t happen all too often so I wouldn’t go as far as to call her an alcoholic. I just think she doesn’t know when to say she has had enough and continues to drink beyond her limit.

Tonight was the last straw. Her mom called me panicked because she had been drinking and fell asleep at a friend’s house. She asked me to pick her up and bring her home which I did. It took 3 people about 30 minutes to get her from the car to her room because she was too intoxicated to walk on her own. We ended up having to call 911 because she started coughing uncontrollably, and we thought she could be choking on her own vomit. Now we have to monitor her through the night to make sure she continues to breathe normally.

I get really frustrated because it’s not like I don’t have plans of my own, but I have to stop what I’m doing to deal with her. Like I said, I love her so much and I really value our friendship. But at what point is a line being crossed? Do I need to continue to be there for her as a friend even though she can get a little crazy? Do I need to talk with her about this?

I don’t know what to do! Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

In 2019 I got out of a relationship that made me feel lost and depressed. I even tried to kill myself. I didn’t have the motivation to go to college and I had a pretty shit paying job. I lost my best friend and ruined the relationship I had with my 2 closest cousins. 

But being alone taught me so much, especially conserving my energy. I saw a therapist, enrolled in college, found another job and continued to work on myself. While I was still unhappy, I just kept it pushin’ because all I knew was that I didn’t want to be stuck in the same place I always was. I didn’t want to depend on other people to “save” me because I wasn’t strong enough to save myself. 

Later in the year I met **him**. A kind, gentle, and patient soul. It always felt too good to be true, I was so scared to love someone again and lose myself. I felt like I had been progressing so much, I was worried that he would be a distraction. But instead, he made it so easy. We learned each other’s ins and outs, our triggers and guilty pleasures. We both had our flaws but we loved each other anyway. 

2020 has been a tough year for all of us. But even in this dark time, I had an outpour of blessings. This year I got engaged, we bought a house together, I started an amazing job where I do meaningful work and am literally saving lives, I’m able to apply for nursing school by next winter quarter, mended my relationship with my cousins and I’m currently 9 months pregnant (and yes still working full time lol) with a baby boy who I’ll be meeting in 3 weeks (more or less). 

This has been one of the most challenging years of my life but I really did **that** and I could not be more proud of myself.

15 minutes later when another doctor came in and checked me she saw my baby's cord was hanging out. I had a prolapsed cord. She shoved her hand up me and I was rushed to the OR. My fiance was not allowed to come with me. No one told him what was going on just left him in the room.
I found out later he was having a panic attack and because of covid nobody in her family's could be there. I heard a doctor yell that she had a dead baby on her hands and everything went white. I remember thinking I would trade my life for his. I coded on the table. They were able to save both of us. In the truest sense of the word I was not there. I had missed the birth of my baby. I was not there. I was gone when he was born.
I didn't get to see my baby for 2 days. He was in the NICU and I was in the regular ICU. It took 2 days for me to be able to get up and get in a wheel chair. It was another 3 days before it was allowed to pick him up. I couldn't breastfeed and I did not get to take care of my baby for a long time. 
I was in the ICU for a week and then I was discharged. My baby was still in the NICU. I was only allowed to see him a few hours a day. He did very well and was able to transfer to a hospital with a nesting area. I was so glad the doctor suggested it. I was crying all the time without him. 
We spent three more weeks in the hospital. After a week the nurses noticed I couldn't walk very well and I was on 5 different medications. They arranged for us to have a private room with a bed for me and meals delivered so I could rest. They were awesome.  We went home when he was a month old. 
I missed his birth and now I cry every day because I have to leave him to work. The doctor said I have post partum depression. I resent every moment away from my baby. He is only 3 months and I can't stay with him. I hate not being the one taking care of him. 
I'm tired. I'm sad. I just want my baby."

I have a friend (A) who wants to goto a busy and popular tourist area in California for New Year's Eve in the middle of rapidly worsening pandemic. On the other hand, another group of friend's (B) wants to do something similar but in a more socially distanced AirBNB than a popular hotel. Unfortunately these groups have never really gotten along with each other over the years due to differing polarizing personalities and other shenanigans throughout our school days.

I'm just trying to stay in my room like I have all fucking year until the pandemic calms the fuck down, California stops being on fire with the coronavirus, and I can safely go on Hinge dates again. Turning down friend (A) at the tourist area led him to getting irritated with me, as he obviously wants to do something but has always been in the belief group of ""I'm not gonna be told what to do about the government"" and downplaying the pandemic/not being scared. Now I am telling group of friend's (B) that I want to hold off on doing the socially distanced trip as I don't want to upset friend (A) who some people in group of friend's (B) doesn't like. 

I'm just losing my fucking mind over here dealing with the twists and turns and complexities of navigating all of these groups of friend's who don't get along but also try to get me to go out and about during an unrealistic time period that I am just trying to get my fucking immuno-compromised ass through alive and in one piece. The guilt, shameful cognitive dissonance and awkwardness of American society and people right now is too much to fucking deal with and it's making my mind seethe in irritation and anger. 

Now don't get me wrong, I love all of my friends, and would travel all over with them if time's were normal. I try to generally be a welcoming and encouraging person with everybody. 

But fuck me for being an introvert and having no problem doing nothing and having things to work on instead of going out to what is going to amount to being a major Super Spreader Holiday New Year.

A while back i tried expressing that the past two weeks had been really terrible and i just needed to breath a bit, my mother then said  that things had been bad for her and she ""cried herself to sleep"" multiple times.

(Tw:mentions of suicide) 
The reason that the past two weeks had been so bad was because my best friend almost died by alcohol poisoning and i watched another friend slit their wrist in front of me. I wasnt able to help either. With my friend i was frozen. All i could do was watch and grab their backpack and fucking cry out side of the nurses office.
I was stressed and constantly on the verge of a complete breakdown or passing out. I asked for a break but i was brushed off.

So parents, please, dont tell your kid to ""suck it up"" or downplay it bc you think that theyre just being ""immature"". Because you dont know the reason."

Today one year ago, I was 12.

I was at my grandparents’ house without a mask. Because that was normal. 

Today one year ago, I was preparing for 2020. Something in my intuition told me that this would be the decade everything in my life flipped upside down. 

This would probably be the decade my grandparents died (they’re in their mid seventies; also, my grandma is obese and my grandpa has heart troubles). It also would probably be the decade where I moved out and went to college. That would mean my parents would probably move out to the east coast. My grandparents’ house (my real home) would be sold, along with every other house from my childhood. And I shouldn’t even be sad about it, because it’s normal. I didn’t even expect to live to 2030 because I was struggling with depression and suicidal ideations. 

I went into 2020 crying, sitting on the bed next to my grandma.

I didn’t see a way out. I knew that everything I had ever known would crumble this decade.

That was one year ago. Well, a lot changed.

I am still depressed, but now it’s worse and I’m on prescription antidepressants. My grandparents are still alive. I wrote a few songs. I picked up the viola and I am never letting it go. I got a new interest in physics. I joined Reddit. I graduated and turned 13. I started at a new middle school. I couldn’t concentrate on anything and failed most of my classes. I almost lost my viola privileges, my only dream. I almost attempted suicide. I self-harmed at one point. I got rid of my LGBT-phobia. I realized that I’m not heterosexual or cisgender, which probably won’t sit well with my LGBT-phobic family. My parents got a new house (we’re not moving, we’re using it as an air-bnb but also as a vacation home). 

It’s not what I expected. I feel like the me I entered 2020 with is dead now, and someone new entirely is the person I’m leaving this year with. I don’t know if I’m still me. I don’t know if I started out as me and became me. But the person I used to be was crushed, and the person I am now is both broken and unbreakable.

Somehow, I don’t feel like I grew. I just... changed. Not for the better. Not for the worse. I’m gray. 

I went into 2020 crying on a bed next to my grandma. When the time comes, I’m coming out of it crying in a dark house alone in my room. 

Happy New Year’s Eve."

I'm in University now and went to a Uni in a different province - although I called my parents quite frequently, I very rarely called my grandparents. I suppose your bond with family really does start thinning from here; as I adjusted to my more adult independent life and started calling even my parents less and less, much less my grandparents.

I'm back home because of COVID now but because for some reason Universities decided to make online school HELLA difficult, even now during winter break I still have a shit ton of work so when my dad video-called my grandparents every few days I still rarely showed up to even say hello. Today is the last day of 2020 in China so my dad video-called with my grandparents, and I went over just as he was about to hang up to say some well wishes. I ended up chatting with my grandpa for a lot longer and before ending the call I wished him Happy New Year and he smiled and said ""Just to be able to see our \[my name\] makes me so happy"" and it hit me how much it meant to them when I showed up in the video calls, even if it's just for a few minutes to say hello.

If you were raised in a Chinese family you might be able to understand my emotions a bit better at these words - hell, I think I can count the number of compliments my family has given me on one hand because words of affection and praise are so rare in this culture. Needless to say I teared up as I did my homework after - all these years I've been so focused on my goals (first it was getting into uni, then getting good grades, then first internship, and now second internship, it never ends) and my grandparents have always asked my dad how I was doing, whether I was eating well, and now even when I'm home I couldn't even bother to show up to greet them because of my workaholic mindset that made me feel guilty whenever I wasn't doing work.

I am hit with the sudden realization that time does not turn back, and they're really getting older and older. Chasing my dreams doesn't mean I should put everything else on pause because life doesn't work that way - time is flowing for everyone and there are things you can't get back.

If your grandparents are still around and they mean a lot to you, I hope these thoughts of mine reach you. No matter what method you use to communicate with them, appreciate every moment because eventually these will become moments you cannot ever go back to no matter how much you want to."

All relationships take work and it'd be foolish to think otherwise, but, whether it be a lack of dating prospects in the area, the dates going nowhere, or of course just being hurt by people who you thought you could trust, people who are able to find someone you can put your full life and trust on the long term are lucky.

I think you're an asshole if, during a global pandemic where people are extremely isolated, you're in a relationship and ranting to a single person about your relationship problems if that person has expressed *any* amount of frustration about being single before. There are plenty of single people who are bitter hearing about relationship issues during normal times, do you really think they want to hear about your relationship problems during a global pandemic? Virtual dating is not the best and New Years Eve will be especially lonely and cold for a lot of people this year.

Single people don't want your pity, we just want the option to start dating again and for couples to recognize a long term loving partner is a gift so please shut up about your small relationship squabbles. Save it for your therapist. Everyone is struggling in different ways during the pandemic, some A LOT more than others. Lots of issues are coming out in relationships, breakups, job loss, health problems... couples don't have it easy by default.

I just lost my relationship a few weeks ago. I know that I was questioning whether or not he was right for me, but I think I lost someone I really connected with. I am so scared right now. He told me that he wanted to get back together a few weeks ago, but then he left me hanging again because he “needs space”. I miss what we had. I loved him so much. He turned into a stranger, but part of me wants to salvage what we had, to see if I can get back the person he used to be. But if I get back together with him, what if he hurts me like this again and leaves? If that happens, I will have no one to blame but myself for trusting him again. And there’s a huge risk in putting myself back out there. What if I meet a man and fall in love only for him to cheat on me, become physically abusive, or worse?

I was planning for a future with this man. All my plans, gone. Out the window. Just like that. I was going to find a job in the town where he worked, and we were going to find a place together. Now I’ve lost any sense of certainty I had.

I am barely making enough to cover my car and other expenses right now. My sister just got a job in her field and is going to move to an exciting new city, and here I am living at home and scraping by on two part-time jobs. I have a teaching degree and wound up leaving a terrible charter school job my first year. I substitute taught after that, and I loved it, but schools are all shut down now. I want to go back to subbing, but is that really a career? I am scared to teach again. I want something with a work-life balance, and teaching doesn’t really have that. At least not in my experience. I don’t know what else I can use my degree for. I want to be able to rent an apartment and support myself fully. Even with subbing, I’m not sure I could afford my own apartment. I’d probably have to get a roommate. I only have a handful of good friends and most are still in school.

I published my first novel. It’s selling decently, but not exceptionally. Right now I’m just hoping that it’ll churn out enough money to pay for what I invested into hiring an editor and cover artist. I feel like it will be a miracle if I actually earn a profit. I want to make money off my writing, but I don’t know if that’s going to happen.

I’m grateful that I’m employed right now. Grateful that I have a roof over my head. My ex told me that I was behind in life. I feel like he’s probably right. I feel like I screwed up by picking the wrong college major and now I’ve messed up monumentally and gotten myself deep into a rut. I have nothing figured out and I’m spiraling into a loop of anxiety and distress because of it. I have a therapy appointment next week. I’ve been browsing Indeed for an hour now. I know that I need to stop throwing myself a pity party and get my life together. I just needed to vent."
knk7nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knk7nc/circumcision_as_a_latino_teen_affected_me/,Circumcision as a latino teen affected me.,7,4,1609394109.0,"I started watching porn when I was around 13. During this, I started to notice how my penis was different from the ones in the videos. I didn't know at the time, but I was uncut and all the penises I was seeing were circumcised. 

Me, being innocent and with full access to the internet, started to research more about it. I discovered the process of circumcision, and how it was very common among people and had lots of advantages. I also saw articles saying how ""Partners prefer cut penises"", how they were ""prettier"", ""'cleaner"" and how they were better overall. I didn't realize that all the articles I was reading were American, and referred to the culture in the US, where circumcision is a common practice. I'm latino, and have been all my life in south america, but due to those articles I thought that circumcision was common all around the globe, and I was different because I wasn't circumcised, when its actually the contrary. This brought me down because I thought I was the uncommon one when actually all of my friends were the same as me. 

Some time later, in a doctor's appointment they discovered I had phimosis (search it up if you dont know what that is). The doctor told my parents the only solution was circumcision. I quickly accepted, because it was my chance to be like the rest. So, I got circumcised. 

A lot of time has passed since then, and I have gotten a lot of information about the subject. I have read how circumcision makes you lose sensitivity, how its basically child mutilation, and how uncommon it is on places outside the US. I've seen the recent uprising of people on Twitter saying uncut penises are better than cut penises, the memes about circumcised people, among other things. I also haven't seen a single cut latino on the internet. Ever. Which ironically puts me in the situation I thought I was when I was little, being the ""different"" one. I think the thing that angered me the most is when I discovered that circumcision is actually recommended to be the last resort in a case of phimosis, and how there are better ways to cure it, which made me realize that my doctor basically wanted to take my parents money by showing them the most expensive solution to my problem. 

I feel like I'm missing something on me. I've gotten rejections because of my penis, mostly because it is uncommon here. Reading how you lose sensitivity as the years go by, how low are the circumcision rates where I live, and all the facts about something I can't change makes me feel in a way that just makes me miserable, as exaggerated as it sounds. 

This is in no way an anti-circumcion post. In the end, it solved my problem, but the cost was high. I honestly don't know what my goal by writing this was.

So I didn’t feel like I had any super deep thoughts on the shrooms when I finally tried them. I was wrong. Took a few days of replay in my head to percolate through, but they basically kept repeating the same thing over and over, which was that the bad things about me are like tattoos & decorations that I decided to let represent me, but they are all external. They said every failure to succeed or to launch, or to feel proud and confident is all down to me believing that something is wrong with me because that’s what i was told every day until I got on a plane to Cali.  

This thing that also stops me from ever being sure enough of myself to just go for something because I am more sure that I haven’t done enough for my kids, myself or others so I can’t presume think of myself as prone to success. They said to stop white knuckling my own progress. I am enough and more importantly I have done enough. 
Then, I was practicing EMDR and watching a traumatic scene between me and my mom. As the EMDR worked, I suddenly understand that that 17 year old girl is not me. We turn over every cell in our bodies many times over in the time between now and the past. Physically, I am literally not her. 

We are all a piece of the same universal spark, which means there is nothing special to me about her pain. Everyone alive has pain and we are all the same spark, so i should not attach extra importance to any particular spark from the past. So I don’t need to respond and live from that baseline, because that’s not my story. It’s hers, the 17 year old. So I can empathize with her but I don’t have to take on the grief or feel any of the shame or disappointment. I don’t need to appropriate her experience and make it my own. Most of all I don’t have to stick to the narrative. 

This is very freeing. It means that I can reevaluate myself using only what currently do or say and my current motivations. It also means I can think on this some more and then cut down some of the bad mental habits I have turned to when trying to smother history. But I’m stoned so will have to schedule that thinking for another time. Thanks for being a place I could write this."

I feel like for the majority of the time between when it happened and now, I've put it away and ignored it. Like I would forget that it happened until something came up. I think I'm lucky in the sense that it's not at the front of my mind all the time, which I know some people deal with. 

I'm getting the feeling that it's in the back of my mind, though. Like it's just sitting there and it's creepy. I feel like I should talk to someone about it. I've gone through the intimacy problems when it came to being with other people, but I still feel like there's something that isn't ""solved"", for lack of a better word. 

Lately, when I try to bring it up, I do so when I'm drunk (because it's hard to talk about sober). It's like I want to talk about it, but I don't know how or who it's appropriate to talk to. I can't go into counseling drunk, so I don't know how to deal with it in another way. I tried going to a rape victims counseling program but I got scared and never went again. 

I tried to bring it up while drunk a few nights ago, but not really talk about the situation that happened. My roommates know I was raped, but that's about it (I think I told them months ago when I was drunk again). Our conversation shifted and I decided to bring up the local rape victims support group. That alone, sort of makes me feel weird. I've been pretty down for the last two days as a result of just making that comment, which by itself didn't specifically pertain to my life, just the work the group does. I just don't want to be with people for a while. 

So I'm not sure if it's embarrassment or something else. I want to talk about it, but I want to know that I can actually speak on it before I pay for therapy with my old therapists whom I loved so much -- I've just never really gotten into this with them. 

I think the rape has been on my mind more since classes have ended - especially because I've had more time to think. I don't know. I just want someone else's input on what I should do."

Pandemic aside, it still would have been an incredibly shitty year. I did get laid off due to the pandemic but it was the first time I have ever been let go from any job. It sucked but I know I will come out the other side of that. 

Over the last 7 years, my mother has battled ovarian cancer. She has been such a strong, resilient fighter through it all. But this year, it has taken a huge toll on her. It has been hard to see how much it has affected even the smallest things like just walking to the bathroom. While I don’t know what is yet to come, I am able to look at it differently and have been able to cope with the anticipatory grief. 

The hardest part of 2020 was the aftermath of getting out of an abusive relationship. Maybe being so isolated during the pandemic didn’t help, but there were some really dark days. I couldn’t understand what I went through and most days I still don’t. I can’t comprehend how a weapon can put someone through that or even justify any of it. To tell someone you love them then lie to their face and make them feel like they are crazy. To belittle them and constantly put down everything they do. I became a shell of myself.  It is still a long road ahead. 

I am just ready to let all this heaviness from 2020 stop getting me down. More than anything I want to move on from that abusive relationship. I want to stop letting him come back into my life to bring me down and stop me from moving forward. I have never been one for resolutions or anything like that. But I am ready to put his year behind me, especially him. I will be stronger and wiser moving forward."

this friend, who ill call ruby, has recently exploded in popularity on twitter for. shitposting essentially. she is hilarious and im glad everyone sees how wonderful she is, but uhhh i gotta say!!!! i'm nowhere near that popular and i'm really jealous!!!!

like i was making a screenprint today and i was feeling Okay about it, and then when i checked twitter while i ate my supper i saw ruby had tweeted something like five minutes prior and had hundreds of favourites and retweets already. and i was just. immediately BATHING in envy. i don't even want to finish my print anymore. i spend HOURS on them and they get like three favourites At Most but ruby says something like 'what if cars were powered by broccoli?? 🤪' and she gets thousands. 

i just don't understand, and i feel terrible about how much i'm starting to. dislike her. like i said, we've been friends for five years, and that's making these feelings so much more painful. we're inseparable, and we always joke about how we're like a Value Pack of opposites. i'm the extrovert, she's the introvert. she's the Cottagecore GF and i'm the Goth GF, and if ur friends with ruby, you're friends with me too - but everyone \~Really\~  wants ruby and not me. it just feels almost like proof that i'll never be as liked as her, and no one will ever like me or my prints or anything no matter how hard i try.

that being said though, i try my damnedest not to let this get in the way of our friendship - she's pretty much my only confidant, and the only other admin of my writing group. but. i can't seem to turn off this Vicious Jealousy Goblin in my brain either. i could be doing fine and then see ruby get retweeted onto my timeline Again and then feel awful for the rest of the day.

i know it would be dumb to cut her off just because She Gets More Attention Than Me, but. i'm really, really tempted. if i got as much traffic as her i wouldn't care at all. but because she gets SO much for saying ONE thing and i don't get half as many for hours of effort....that feels like something's wrong with Me Personally, u know? ruby's my best friend, and i feel like i'm living in her shadow; which really hurts."

   My dad’s girlfriend has been around for about three years and we have developed a stronger relationship together over the quarantine definitely. But every time she leaves to go back to her house or to just go to the store or something, I get really anxious and worry that she won’t come back which then makes me get this nervous feeling in my stomach and I feel like I want to cry. I had this feeling for at least a year and a half with her and I feel bad that I think like this every time she leaves. I’m also just confused why I feel like this with her and not anyone else. When my mom’s boyfriend leaves I never feel anxious about it. I know he’ll come back. I know that she will come back but my head is telling me not. 
     I feel childish sometimes too because some days I just want to snuggle up on the couch next to her and let her arm wrap around me. But I just don’t get why my relationship with her is so close but so far feeling at the same time(if that makes any sense). For example: I’m not a hugger normally but from the first week I met her, I just felt comfortable hugging her. It’s not like I don’t give my parents hugs but they are still uncomfortable to me but they aren’t with her. I feel comfortable talking to her about how I feel but I get so nervous to start the conversation of how I feel. I love spending time with her but at the same time I feel nervous like I need to be with her all the time because I’m so afraid that she will leave and not come back. I’ve begun to realize that I don’t even like going to friends’ houses houses now when she is at our house because I’m afraid that she won’t be there when I come back. All of this is just so confusing to me though and I really wish someone could relate or help me with why I feel like this. The only reason why I think I’m so anxious is that when my dad and my stepmom broke up, it was so sudden and it was like one day she was there and the next she wasn’t. 
   Sorry this was so long and probably confusing. I’m even confused just reading it myself but I feel like this is not normal."

I just wanna say that I'm so happy that I'm reading again!! Ever since I was a kid, I really love reading books. I think I was in 3rd grade when I first read a novel and I fell in love with books. But life did not turn out well for me, I was diagnosed of depression and anxiety when I was in 8th grade and I just stopped doing the things that I love. I tried to read again before but I just couldn't finish the book. Before I always read like 20-30 pages but when depression hit me, I can only read like 2-3 pages because I'm having a hard time to concentrate and focus. I was so frustrated that I don't want to read anymore or finish the book. I was really depressed since books are the only thing that keeps me company. I've been going to therapy for two years now and I'm slowly healing and doing better. I know this year was so bad but I took this time to really reflect about everything. I don't know what happened but something like clicked on me and told me to try and read again, its like this inner child of me told me to read again and maybe something will change. So I download the book ""Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury"" because someone recommended it to me years ago and I tried to read again. Even though I'm kinda slow on reading books but I am so happy that I'm starting to read again!! I can now concentrate and focus while reading. I was crying few weeks ago since I can feel the excitement, love and joy again when I was starting to read. I feel like I'm a kid again because of this happiness that I have right now. I really can't wait to go to the bookstore and buy books again!!! Since there's a pandemic going on and I cannot go to the bookstore yet, I decided to bought a kindle for Christmas to award myself and I was so happy!!

I don't know if anyone will read this but I really cannot express how happy I am that's why I decided to put a post here. If you want to recommend me some books to read since I did not read books for almost 6 years, let me know. I don't have any prefer genre since I read all kinds of books but I love reading sci-fi books and nonfiction books too. Right now, I'm re-reading the ""The Hitchhikers's Guide to the Galaxy"" on my kindle.

I met him in my early 20's when he and his friends briefly lived in my city. None of us had any money and we were all living crazy lives of running around the city drunk and high, having adventures, living in shitty squalid housing, and trying to make something of ourselves.   


I met Carlos and his friends through a very random series of events and loosely connected people. To this day, Carlos is the most beautiful man I have EVER seen in my life. I was too intimidated to talk to him. His friend, X, was immediately interested in me and somewhat latched onto me, paying me a ton of attention. So the whole night, I hung out with X, but couldn't take my eyes off Carlos, and also couldn't talk to him. Of course that same very night, Carlos met an extremely beautiful girl, they kissed, and I painfully watched the whole thing.   


So I briefly dated X for a few months and hung around their friends a bit. X met someone else and tried to play both of us for a minute, then chose her and was done with me. I was fine with that, it wasn't meant to be with him at all. I forgave him and then their whole friend group moved across the country, including the new girlfriends.   


I was in touch with X on rare occasions and followed their lives online from a distance as our lives have gone in completely different directions over the past 12 years. As I could see online, Carlos stayed in a long relationship for many years, then another long one with a different person. I'd occasionally look in on them wondering if they changed or aged, but they never did, and Carlos only got more and more beautiful.  


I haven't thought about X and his friends in several years but as this insane year of 2020 draws to an end, and I became single this year, I was thinking about all the different periods of my life and the people I met along the way.   


I looked them up for the first time in years and looked at Carlos, and all of a sudden I felt extremely overwhelmed. I was overwhelmed that when I look at him, I still feel the same way as the first night I saw him. Many times in my life I've felt like I'd regret it forever if I missed out on doing something, and I have been able to do all the things I wanted to. But I was suddenly overwhelmed with the feeling that if I never tried to make something happen between me and Carlos, I would regret it for the rest of my life, more than any other human action I've missed out on.   


Yes, I recognize it's crazy and weird to feel this way about someone I met so long ago and barely talked to. On the other hand I think it says something that I still feel this same way 12 years later, that I could feel so strongly after 12 year with so little to go on. This has never happened to me before with any other person, I've had a very typical dating and relationship history, and am not prone to strong feelings over people I don't know.   


I've never cheated and I've never allowed someone to cheat on a significant other WITH me, either. So I know many people would think I am a trash person for this, but I AM going to try to get Carlos to cheat on his girlfriend with me. Because of course he has one, as always, although this one seems to be relatively new.   


I am going to try my absolute hardest to hook up with him, and if we hook up just once, that's all I need from him."

I use to work in a decently large shopping centre, of course with a big food court, and every day I would see a shocking amount of kids under the age of 12 who probably weigh just as much as a me (5'11 male decently built with but of excess weight), and all I can think about is how pathetic and useless the parents are who let their children get to this state. Now I understand people will get mad at this and downvote me because it is an unpopular opinion, so let me just state my POV;

Healthy food is NOT expensive, if anything it's cheaper then a consistent source of fast food, but it does take knowledge of what to buy and how to prepare it, which should be mandated to be taught in schools, or at least a very mainstream class that teaches people to produce easy and healthy meals. 

A child will most likely not have the knowledge of what is good and bad for the person, and how to moderate. Because honestly before I started fasting, where u monitored my intake and how much cardio I need to do to remove it, I didn't really have an idea.

And regardless, the parents SHOULD be able to keep their children's weight in line, make sure they are exercising, eating decently healthy, remove unnecessary sodium from their diet. I understand you can't stop them from eating stuff with you aren't with them, but don't just buy them chocolates or candy every time they ask, and if they're 10 years old and crying in target because they can't get a snickers, and you cave in and buy it, them YOU are a bad parent. FFS give your child discipline."

But at the same time, it's hard on my body physically and emotionally. I'm sure he would say the same, or not. Yet I was hoping for a proposal next year, seeing as he said he was planning one....and the week before the breakup I was smitten as hell. He came to visit early this month for my bday, and then when he got back things were fine until the 20th when he decided that he can't handle a relationship at the moment.

In which he also said he loved me but was no longer in love with me...

I would have been elated at the idea of carrying his baby if it weren't for the fact that I was dumped and have no idea if we will ever get back together again. He basically upped and left me alone. Maybe he didn't mean to, but that's what it feels like. I wasn't feeling good but figured it was stress. I didn't eat after the breakup for a week, and then I also had drinks on Christmas thinking that things were fine.

Well, they weren't. I haven't been taking care of myself. Early this morning I woke up with cramping in my lower back but just took it as another sign that my period was on it's way. Did some high intensity cardio. Next thing I know it was a repeat of last time and I was having a miscarriage. It's exhausting. This year, this month, this week has been nothing but exahusting events after exhausting events.

I had a hard time and am still having a hard time over the breakup. Breaking up means I have to say goodbye to all those sweet and beautiful dreams I had together with him... and I feel like this is another reminder.

I'm in pain, I'm miserable. I don't want to eat again. I know he is going through a lot of depression which has been made worse because of covid. At the same time I wish I could just tell him and be held by him. For me it feels unfair. Because I can't even tell him since we have broken up. Yes, he is a friend. But I don't want to make him feel guilty or worse off."
knho8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knho8u/hating_religions_and_religious_people_regardless/,Hating religions and religious people regardless is stupid,7,4,1609384651.0,"The thing is simple, everywhere I go on reddit I see people insulting religions and religious people often for no reason, or maybe generalizing certain behaviours.

I repute myself Christian, and sometimes I pray even on my own, but I only follow the idea that you should love everyone independently of gender, religion, skin colour etc. And you shouldn't hold prejudices (I'm not perfect in this, because I actually hold some prejudices on black people for example, but even then it's only toward strangers, because once I start socializing I've got no problems no matter the colour of the skin).

Yet sometimes, when I read some comments, it seems as if every Christian is some kind of hypocrite homophobic and backward idiot who can't do anything on his own which thinks that every merit goes to God.

Something that I can't understand even more is getting angry when someone prays for Covid's victims or something similar; I'm not saying that prayers alone will resolve everything, but once someone isn't a medic what can he do other than remain indoors and offering spiritual support to others?

In my opinion most religions, unless they are cults, nowdays have positive and inclusive ideas (even if faith for me should always be based on your personal beliefs, and not blindly following those of other people), and while the books which they are based off have  several centuries, and have some ancient ideals, it doesn't mean that you can't follow the good ideals they contain.

So if you had some bad experiences with religion, insult the people that caused them, if you think that some ideas are stupid, that depends, because sometimes I do too (like I don't absolutely think that God has created us, but I believe that some perfect or near-perfect being exists and that he could do something about our prayers, if he cares enough to); and remember that if some asshole uses religion as an excuse to behave like that, it's not the religion fault, but the person.

So I want to conclude saying good life to everyone, hope this is the right sub for this rant, because after exhausting all my remaining energy in this post, I noticed that where i live it's fucking 4 a.m. and now i need sleep."

I also love my father he was always there for me and taught me to be respectful to other people. I am a very gentle boy and have never hit anyone. but I am about to. ever since my 14-year-old sister got a phone she has become ruder and disrespectful. it started with fairly innocent stuff like her opening a door and saying some slang like hey btches or some other trendy stuff like that. I think this is where the problem started my mom never used any form of discipline or either put any boundaries. later on, she started talking with people that have no form of discipline or any morals. she started talking with a bunch of losers. I mean losers as unpleasant people that have nothing to offer other than the pinnacle of human greed. (I wanna add that she lost all of her old friends that used to be with her) she had a lot of drama last year and lost most of her friends. don't blame them in fact I can understand them. I also wish I could get rid of her but it looks like I'm gonna be either me or my mom to leave first. my mom has three kids and that includes me. I'm the older one (17) and we have another one who is (7). the 7-year-old is somewhat a spoiled brat but it's not something I am worried off. my 14-year-old sister is making our family torn apart. she will lie about going to the mall to hang out with friends and stay over at a friend's house and sleepover without telling my mother and if called by mom she will either hang up or deny it until night arrives and she manipulates my mom to let her stay even though she lied.

One day when she did the same thing my mom was sick. and usually, my mom would pick up my sister.

due to the fear of having covid and my mom not feeling in great shape. she could not get her. this is where i don't get my mom. why would she in the first place drive her back home. she lied about it and now she should take the consequences of her actions and take the bus home herself. the whole trip back home will take 25 min maximum. so it's not that bad. but what my sister did instead of taking a 25-minute trip. is calling my mom for over 7 hours on repeat asking to get driven home when my mom cant, she kept demanding and spammed us on my mom's messages and even me on my Snapchat. my mom told her that she was sick and she would not believe it. it was my mom's day off as well since she had been working all week providing for the family. so I wanted my mom to slack off that day. that did not work though and it ended up with my mom smashing her head in a wall from all the stress. I and my dad completely freaked out. my mom was running for the kitchen drawer and tried to get a knife. we stopped her and I'm not sure what would have happened if I or my dad was not there. it might seem a bit intense but I'm only covering so much of the stress she puts on the family. she curses us out all the time. goes out without asking. and lately, i have not been able to get enough sleep. she has been talking with a bunch of people on her phone all night and because of our thin walls, i can hear anything. her voice shocks me every time she speaks a sentence. my heart starts pounding and I feel uneasy and the volume of the noise of course. I have only been getting a few hours of sleep and I feel very shitty. as I'm writing this my sister about 40 minutes ago used the oven in the middle of the night without asking anyone and tried to make a cake with the cake we were gonna eat for new Year eve. small petty stuff like that ended up with me almost punching her. my dad pushed me away from her and my mom blamed my dad for being violent. my dad is cold-blooded and never reacts to stress or ever gets angry he is pretty chill. but this is the first time I have seen him go on his knees and let out a moaning cry. after my parents left the room I could hear her laugh at her friends. I told her from the bottom of my heart that I think she is a disgusting person and she called me a f\*ggot. I can't take this anymore and my mom cant, depression runs in my family and I have never thought to be a guy who is depressed. she is the only problem I have in my life. I told my online friends about my situation. but they said that she was neglected. and I told her that my mom would give all the attention in the world. but they kept on insisting that it reflects the parents. but neither of my parents are manipulative and does not care about their family. my online friends might be a bit rough but they are the reason I'm not bored when I'm awake so il forgive them for that. this felt good to get off my chest and thank you if you made it this far. id love any constructive ideas and thoughts on this!!!"

I think as a team we had a very good dynamic and we often got praised and recognized for the work we were doing by both higher ups within the company and external collaborators. I had always been used to working alone or maybe assigning some tasks to an intern so I didn't really have a clue how to be someone's line manager. However I did my best to encourage and push forward the achievements of my direct report and in return she was very receptive and also very supportive, trying to help me as much as possible and always told me I was the best boss she could hope for. However, I had the suspicion that she saw me as more than a co-worker because she made several attempts to bond with me outside of work, possibly even a silly office crush. Yet, I thought that it would be unprofessional of me to befriend my direct reports so outside of work I kept my distance.

Fast forward a year later, I move across the country for a better-paid position with more responsibilities and a bigger team. However I feel like I don't have the same dynamic with this team. I feel like my direct reports don't really put in all that much effort and often times I have to thoroughly review their work. Maybe having worked for more than half the time since I've been with them remotely did not really enable adequate communication. However I feel like I am getting busier and busier trying to work with my new team and the work is not really the best I've produced in my life. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my first direct report and how much I miss her supportive attitude. I called her once when the number of covid cases exploded in the state she was in to check that she was OK but I kept it rather professional.

This month has been particularly bad and a few kind words from someone in my trade would help a lot, but it would feel awkward to ask for her supportive attitude when she no longer works with me. It makes me sad and regret the fact I never made an effort to be her friend outside of work too, especially now that I realize that people more experienced than me often form bonds with those below them within the company hierarchy. I suppose you don't fully appreciate what you had until you lose it."

I am a creative person. I am a writer, I want to spend my life writing and researching and I want to be known for these things. I make stuff like crafts and sewing, painting, making things all the time which I know could be sold, but I just don't have the confidence to sell them.

My SO proposed on Christmas day. We've been together for 8 years, and this year has been tough like it has been for so many of us. He was made redundant and has struggled with getting another job. We're signing on to universal credit from the beginning of Jan, I've never had to do this before. He has job prospects, but I work in a shop making just above minimum. When I have tried to get a proper job in the past, I've really struggled mentally to deal with the full time hours, and the office politics and not taking my work home with me. I had a mental breakdown after only a year and it broke me entirely. Now I'm terrified of getting a 'real job'.

But now we're looking at getting married. We had money in the bank saved at the beginning of this year but due to the redundancy and a car collision where I was at fault, and then repairs to the replacement car we bought, those savings are almost gone. We scrimped for years to get to that point and in the course of 10 months they're almost wiped. 

Despite this, we're now looking at getting married and everything seems so crazy expensive. I'm happy to either get married for cheap or to wait until we can afford the wedding we actually want but... My SO pointed out that even if we save £400 every month for the next two years (which is impossible - even before he was redundant, that would wipe out all our money for the month) then we won't even save £10k. I don't intend to spend anywhere near that amount on a wedding, but it did make me suddenly think about, what about when we want to save for a house? A down payment for a house will be easily £20-30k. That'll be at least 6 years of saving and no eating or doing anything that's fun.

So the obvious thing is that I get a better job, right? I stop pursuing writing, stop working in a shop which until now pays our bills (his cheque covered our rent) and find something that pays better just so we can live a comfortable life.

Only that thought terrifies me.

Not the comfortable life bit. The getting a job which I will hate and will probably break me again just so I can have enough money to not be on the brink of poverty for the rest of my life.

I don't think I live in the real world."

I loved her, deeply. Despise our highs and lows, I thought we tried our best to construct a healthy relationship, and technically, on relationship *was* good and our intimacy was excellent. For context, we are both 29 years old.

Well, yesterday, she told me after coming back from work in tears : *I can't take it anymore...*

I was in shock. We talked, we talked, and we talked...  and today (she spent the last night at her girl friend to rationalize everything and think about it) she officially admitted that for the past 2 years, she lost her desire to be with me, and that despise all her efforts, she couldn't manage to overcome her initial thoughts. She also admitted that she didn't feel the desire to have sex with me anymore, even though the sex was totally fine and I had no doubts about that part of our relationship whatsoever. I would argue the sex was better now than it was during the first 3 years.

Tonight, we both cried at our kitchen table for a whole hour. She said I was an exceptional person, and that she didn't want to see me suffer for so long, which is why she told me everything now. She said that she wants to part ways, and live independently for a while, to rebuild herself. So it's not a break, but an official statement...

&#x200B;

This is awful. Terrible. I am speechless. She left the house a hour ago to go sleep at her girl friend's house, and that she'll come back tomorrow to pick up some stuff.

&#x200B;

We share a house together, in a small little town in my small rural region where I brought her a few years ago after we met in college. There is no escape over here, pretty much all our friends are mutual. Everywhere I go, it will remind me of her. All her friends that I've talked so far have pretty much told me (and they were in TOTAL SHOCK too) that despise this, they will remain my friend and that they'll always be there for me.

&#x200B;

I'm sitting right here, looking at all the furniture we bought together, all the memories, all the fun boardgames we played together, remembering all the friends we met/had with each other from the past years, etc. The sniff of her perfume as I walked into our bedroom earlier brought me to tears. This is... this is... there are no words for it. I thought everything was fine... EVERYONE thought everything was fine, we were considered a ""textbook example of a good relationship""... I loved her family and they all loved me, same thing for her with my family... we were cuddling and having fun just a few days ago... This is a dream, right, this must be a dream..."

She has two wonderful kids. The relationship between is rocky sometimes but most of the time they are ok. She is awesome and made an agreement with him to pay WAY LESS the child amount that he should. He pays like $200 per kid a month. He is a good father, he does spend time with them every other day but she has the lion share of the bills and responsibilities. Whenever she has extra money like when they gave us the ebt cards he wanted half of the amount even though she had them the whole time and he only feeds the kids 4 times a week max. He lives with his family where he doesn't pay rent or pay bills and they only ask him for basic personal necessities for the house. He wanted to use the card for that. He has a really good job but he doesn't really like it. G's ex-husband has mentioned that he is unhappy with his job. Lately a member of her family who we will call C spoke with her. C works in a high earning job which G's ex-husband could work in and therefore make more money. C was asking if there was any chance of them getting back together and she let him know that that ship has sailed. C said that the only way he would help would be is G's ex-husband  would give her more money for the kids. G knows that he is unhappy with work but they are ok in the parental relationship but if he does get the work G would probably have to get him to court to pay more which would get him way angry at her and he would gripe and hate giving any extra money at all. Trust me on this he would. I have known them both for years it's true. G came to ask me what I thought. I really hate the idea of denying an opportunity but at the same time I think things are ok how they are. Her ex doesn't know anything. We were thinking that if he was that unhappy he could have done something himself to get in a better job or something that he liked. We leave to you reddit."

About a month and a half ago i started hanging out with my cousin who lives across the street from me(We've always been friends, hungout a few times outside of family events) First, I would come over n smoke, we would joke n bs, I would help her out with her kids, then go home. Sometimes I'd fall asleep here, or just ask if I could stay to not be rude. Normally I'd sleep at the foot of the bed or in the living room. Most nights after the kids fall asleep we'd listen to music, smoke, have wine, etc. At some point our conversation got flirty. Kind of like a ""I'm joking unless you're down"" kinda thing. 
Well clearly we were both down one night almost two weeks ago n things took a turn. 
Currently, behind closed doors things are kindaa... ""relationship"" like but not a bf/gf relationship. . I mean like, were flirtatious, hugging, snuggling, and have done the deed a few times since..
Were first cousins and understand why its ""wrong"" to the extent of children but were safe. 
Since we know it's a harshly judged subject were not telling anyone we know at all. But family is questioning.. so I need to know
Are we f*cked up or?
Why IS it so harshly judged?
Anyone have a similar situation?
Why does it feel... right??

TLDR: cousins, hangout, little flirt, big flirt, kiss, fornicate, likey."

My mom caused a huge fight over it. This made my boyfriend and I sad. On Saturday, my mom made a casual, offhanded, remark that ""It was a good thing my boyfriend was sad he couldn't see me. He deserved a taste of his own medicine for not letting her see me earlier this year.""

That pissed me off. I already validated my mom feeling hurt over not being able to see me the day before she made that remark, plus numerous times way before that. The fact that she could be so cruel and unemphatic to my boyfriend and I's feelings caused me to cancel plans. She was telling me to just let go and didn't show any concern when I was visibly upset. She insisted we go to the mall while I was upset. I had her leave my house early as a result of her invalidating behavior. Tomorrow is her birthday. That's part of what is making me feel for her."
kngmsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kngmsv/i_accidentally_backed_into_a_car_and_then_left/,"I accidentally backed into a car and then left, technically.",1,3,1609381005.0," I was driving in a town notorious for accidents due to impatient and inexperienced drivers and narrow roads. I was making a K-turn on a street when suddenly a car came driving towards with me and gave no signs that they were stopping, we're gonna call this car, Car B. Maybe out of fear or some reaction I slowly backed up and hit the car that was parked on the other side of the road, we'll call this one Car C. The driver wasn't there, I waited for about 20 minutes but I'm a doordash driver and had to deliver food. I went to inspect Car C but I couldn't see any visible damage, but there was a small scratch on my car that I discovered after the ordeal which leads me to believe there had to have been something done to theirs. I drove to a parking lot across the street, just so I wasn't blocking anyone. I was looking down at my phone, texting my parents about the situation and when I looked up the owner of Car C got inside their vehicle and drove off. Now normally, this would have been a series of pretty lucky events, perhaps he didn't see the damage if there was any, or perhaps it was so minor that it didn't matter, but what's worrying me is that Car B, the car that was driving towards me without stopping, parked on the other side of the road during the entire situation. Once Car C was gone, I started driving and as soon as I started driving Car B started driving behind me as well. I immediately pulled over to see if Car B wanted to confront me, or say something but after I pulled over he drove right passed me without even looking at me. I'm worried they saw I bumped the car, stayed to make sure I stayed, took a picture of my car and plate, and went to report it. There was no actual report of the ""accident"" made, I first looked through my car to see if I could write a note but the car is brand new so I had neither paper nor anything to write with. I should have been more attentive when the owner of Car C got in their vehicle. I'm worried because technically, what I did was a hit and run. If at any moment the owner of the vehicle either finds the damage if there was any, or if he knew there was damage and suddenly decided to report it, I'm worried that Car B would already have taken a picture of my car, so tracking me down would be easy. Sorry for the long story, I'm super stressed about this right now. I just purchased this car recently because 6 months ago I was rear ended and my car was totaled meaning I've been out of a job since then. I've had my new car for about a week and can't afford to lose my license over something like this. Thank you for your support, I have no idea what to do."

I’ve drank everyday since my mom passed away as a coping mechanism. I have had night terrors since I was a kid. And they used to be scary... to the point that I woke myself up screaming to her holding me. Now, they are realistic dreams that she’s still alive.and every time I wake up it’s because I’m crying because I want it to be real. 

My mom died when I was 17. She was 36. 

So now I drink because drunk people don’t usually dream when they pass out: which is how I’ve navigated my last decade. It’s only when I’m sober for bed that I have elaborate dreams of why and how she’s still here. And every time I’m just happy to hear and see her even though her voice has faded with time. 

I have decided now at 33 that’s it’s time I regain my life. I want to be sober and do what sober people do (I’m still looking into it) but I know that 
I don’t want my life revolving around a timer of when to start drinking. I want my husband to know that I do love him by falling asleep with him. I want me to know that I’m going to OK!!! 

I just want to be ok..."

Its been the worst year of my life so far, and I'm sure a lot of people feel this way. I couldn't remember the last time I felt a bit of happiness. I was absolutely dreading today because I've been in an abusive unstable house with severe mental health problems, and on Christmas I tried to take my life again.

But today, I felt moments where I was happy. It was my birthday, and although it wasn't perfect and although its not been ideal in the pandemic, I think I needed today more than ever. 

I've been sung happy birthday four times today, I woke up to find a package of presents from my mum, my twin, my twin's gf and their family. I met up with a couple friends for a walk, watched a film with another, spoke with my twin who I couldn't be with, played scrabble with my housemate and watched some tv with my mum who has supported me all year. 

Even though I have had some insecurities, meltdowns and sadness, that have threatened to send me into a spiral, even though my dad isnt alive to be with me, it was a good day. 

It might not be much when I compare myself to other people I know, but I am so grateful for the love around me, and the reminder that I might not have much, but I have more than I think. People love me, and I needed this more than I can ever let anyone know. 

I really hope I can hold on to this memory through the bad times. Maybe things can get better some day."

As I get older it gets tougher to have my birthday on NYE - everyone wants me to plan something I want to do, everywhere is super expensive and overcrowded, everyone has some sort of plan already so whatever plan I do make just ends up on the “I’ll stop by” list. The last couple years my birthday has sucked (thanks to the shitty men). 

This year I was actually looking forward to my birthday. I’m single, and I kind of love that the pressure of finding a bar and/or restaurant is off since everything is closed due to covid. My two best friends and I made plans 2 months ago to just make cocktails and hang out. They were texting me all up until yesterday about how excited they were and I got everything prepared - bought snacks, drinks, an outfit, etc. 

Yesterday I found out one friend (B) decided to live with her parents a few days ago. B says her parents aren’t comfortable with her being inside anywhere because of covid. That’s fine, makes sense. We decided to change plans and hang out outside during the day for a couple hours so friend B could drive home before the drunk drivers were out. I was a little bummed I’d be alone for NYE night but was glad we were able to work something out.

Until today. I got a text after I got off work that the whole thing is cancelled. Turns out my other friend (C) moved out of state a week ago. Her plan was to fly in to celebrate - which is super nice - but decided that since plans were changed to a day time event , it wasn’t worth it.  Plus no one was aware C planned to hang out with us right after getting off an airplane from a place that isn’t doing well covid-wise. B decided that since C isn’t coming anymore, it’s not worth it to do anything. 

I feel so frustrated and lonely. I’ll be completely alone on my birthday. Not even my roommate will be home since I let her know weeks ago that I’d be celebrating with friends tomorrow. Im trying not to be upset with my friends. I know most of this is because of covid. I just feel so defeated. 

Happy new year y’all. God I hope 2021 is just a sliver better than 2020."

I was just talking to my parents about how I don't want to move in with a significant other seeing as they alway argue about even the most mundane things. I then said (jokingly) that if they argue so much that they should just divorce. My parents then took me into the lounge room and said that they were going to split up for 12 months. My parents have split up before (only for 4 months thought) and during this period they went to marriage counselling and ended up together again at the end. 

I would be lying if I said that their marriage wasn't as good as has been lately. This includes them not acting all lovey dovey as per usual, not talking/joking as much with each other and not having sex (I know this because they always sleep with their bedroom door open ""so that the cat can go inside""). 

I honestly don't know how to cope with this news. I still get to go the same school (thank God) but I don't know if I have to stop living in this house and if I have to  move neighbourhoods. Also, the fact that they are splitting up for 12 months makes me think that they are splitting up for good and will end up getting a divorce.

3 years ago i worked at a well known family friendly chain restaurant. it was my first serving job. i had worked in a previously toxic environment as a busser & left due to ongoing harassment. i made it clear to the manager that hired me that i would not be harassed like that (the place was a locally owned sports restaurant/bar & everyone knew how bad it was). i clearly indicated in my interview that i had applied *here* because i was being harassed *there*. it was promised to me i would have no problems.

l o l.

i had a coworker, who was a dishwasher/busser, that was on the autism spectrum & after a month of working there he started sexually harassing me. started out with reference comments such as “liking women in red lipstick” (which i wore often because it was winter going into spring) & then it advanced. he became brave & would grab my hips & ass in the kitchen but if there was an available reachable body part he would *randomly, not every time* make it a point to touch me when i would walk past him anywhere in the restaurant). the physical part started out as hugs & i tried to make it clear that i didn’t like hugging my coworkers, because i don’t. i keep work very much work & don’t take home to work nor work back home. i made it very apparent i am a personal bubble kinda person & he continued to touch me. when he realized i wasn’t gonna hug him multiple times every shift, it got to the point where when i didn’t accept his friend request on facebook, he confronted me in person. i would say, “i only accept people that i personally associate with” & he would say “am i not your friend?” one can only imagine how fed up i became. so i reported it to management & it got brushed under the rug as “he has autism, you have to understand that he doesn’t know boundaries.”

eventually i quit the job because he, management & several other people were too problematic. i continued my education, & now am mad i never took legal action against the dude for harassment.

to this day i feel extremely mad because i reported him & made myself the bad guy for even saying anything, but i feel even worse because it didn’t matter he made me uncomfortable & touched me inappropriately, but because “he has autism” it was written off as friendly. & because i’m a social pushover, i tried to get my point across without hurting his feelings, which made him feel like i was his friend, & i regret not telling him to get the fuck off of me or else.

i should have taken legal action but everyone in my community would have been pissed & i would have been the evil person for thinking that an autistic man would sexually harass me."

But I'm 24, and I've struggled on and off with depression since I was a teenager. One thing that was/is hard for me when I'm feeling down is taking care of my health and hygiene, gross I know. I've gotten a bit better in the second half of 2020 but when it comes to my teeth, a lot of damage has already been done. 

I haven't been to a dentist since 2018 (after coming out of a long depression, go figure), I got some cavities filled and a root canal. My habits had gotten so bad I honestly forgot brushing your tongue was a thing. They were very concerned about my tongue but luckily it was fine, just the multiple cavities and tooth that needed a root canal. Since the root canal and crown I've not been back to any dentist, and after the shit show that was 2020, struggling again with depression 2019/2020, the fog has started to lift a bit, and I realize I've really hurt myself these past couple years. I have so much pain in my mouth some days, that I finally scheduled an appointment with a dentist who accepts my insurance and is accepting new patients (took a while to find one) but they're scheduling out to mid February, so I've got to just suck it up for the next month and a half.

Also I know in the year of covid complaining about my birthday probably seems trivial but hopefully I'll be excused for my ranting.

As the title implies my birthday has the misfortune of falling on NYE and while not the worst day for a birthday (pretty sure Xmas day would win on that one) for as long as I can remember it's been pretty awful, from the condescending default response when I tell people of 'everyone is out celebrating your birthday' to the endless excuses friends and family have to not spend any time with me on the day as they have other plans that 'I wouldn't be interested in' and the dreaded joint birthday/xmas presents, which 90% of the time is the same thing my brother gets but for him it's just an Xmas present because he's fortunate to have his birthday earlier in the year (not such an issue these days but as a kid growing up and seeing that it really gets to you).

I even had one guy message me the other day and literally say to me ""at least no one has to make shitty excuses for not seeing you this year"" after my area of the UK was put into Tier 4 (lockdown in all but name). I know that guy was just trying to have a joke with what he said but it's the absolute truth in that is what happens every year. Even my mum forgot it was my birthday when asking what I was planning to do for new years (we are in a support bubble, for non UK peeps it might be worth looking up) and when I replied with getting a year older she sounded very surprised and asked if it really was my birthday and then remembering 'Oh yeah it is'.

This year will be the 2nd year that it will just be me and my 2yo with the first being a bit of a blur as it was not long after my 10 year relationship with my kids mum ended, and it just feels like whats the point, I don't remember the last time I got a card, or call or even a Facebook message from the majority of my family or friend group on my actual birthday, a couple tend to trickle in for about a week after with the customary sorry I forgot message.

This year of all years nobody should be out celebrating on NYE to help contain covid, but for me what hits home is that for my birthday at least this is normal, I wouldn't be going out because anyone I try to invite out or make plans with already has plans and doesn't want me there. So I guess it'll just be another normal day for me, looking after my kid, putting her to bed, and spending the rest of it alone, not really much to celebrate from what I can see."

I’m just saying like if they love them so much why do they waste their time wanting others to know, like seriously I don’t give a shit about your thoughts on your favourite celeb’s posts, and I sure as shit don’t wanna see you and another Stan exchange cringe conversation.

My point is;
that it really looks (crystal clear) like a waste of time and I wish I could just be a Stan for a day and see what their mindset is like and why they feel so compelled to what someone-
(who has not got a single clue who they are) 
does and feel the need to actually wanna get into their life almost; it seems."

knf38w,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knf38w/i_met_my_dads_mistress_and_her_kids_today/,I met my dad’s mistress and her kids today,6,5,1609375846.0,"She was...nice. A friendly lady. Her daughters too, but we didn’t have much in common. Both of them are still really young, 9 and 12.

I’ve suspected my dad has had an affair with this lady for a while. Never confirmed until today, but he would spend every single weekend out of the house with her. As the months went on I saw my mom become more and more miserable. Angry. Tired. Sad. She knew, but she wasn’t and still isn’t in a financial position to leave him. He refuses to divorce. Says it’s bullshit and that him and mom are gonna stay together. But him and his mistress are together, too. His mistress knows about my mom, always has.

I’ve met this woman twice. Twice. Her kids once. Yet today she kept calling us a family. ”This is family time” ”family bonding” ”family day out”. The 12 year old said she was so excited to have a big sister. But...we’re not a family. I don’t want to be part of their family. I have one already, I have a mom and I have a brother and I have a dad. The mistress kept overstepping so many physical boundaries. She hooked her arm in mine as we walked, pet my hand during dinner, stayed uncomfortably close, kept calling me ”honey” and ”sweetie”. The 12 year old looked so happy when telling her mom that she was gonna go for drinks with me on her 18th birthday. The 9 year old excitedly told me that she wants me to do her makeup sometime.

It disgusted me how easy it was for dad and his mistress to kiss or hold hands in front of me and my brother, who - to dad’s knowledge - still thought him and mom were happily together. It made me physically ill when her kids so easily called my dad their stepdad, or called themselves my brother’s new sisters. I’m 18 years old but I still couldn’t help but think ”he’s my dad, not yours” ”that’s my brother, not yours”, like a pouty child about a toy.

Dad and I have had a strained relationship for years now. I can go days without talking to him. When we do talk, it’s awkward. Feels unnatural. Yet I’m so irrationally angry that these people are taking him away from me. Maybe because I know, deep down, that I’m a disappointment to him. He’ll love his new stepdaughters more because they’re more like the daughter he wanted me to be. And it hurts. My brother will finally have sisters closer to his age. Maybe he’ll like them more than me too.

They’re planning on us all meeting up ”as a family” more often. I don’t want to. At the same time, I don’t want to hurt the kids by not going. They believe they have a cool new big sister who’ll drive them places and buy them alcohol for parties and do everything sisters do. But I don’t think I’ll ever be that, ever.

I hate seeing my mom hurting. I want her to leave, as soon as possible. And I want to go with her. I don’t know how often I’ll visit my dad.

I don’t hate my dad, or his mistress, or her kids. They were nice people. I’m sure I would’ve adored them under different circumstances. I feel so numb, yet so angry and hurt at the same time. I knew this was coming, but it still feels like a trainwreck."

I don't post often, am I supposed to put that there?? 🤷 Well, I did. 

Not gonna lie, I'm angry. He knows better, he is a fucking nurse and has worked (intermittent, short times) on the covid unit in his hospital. In most ways he is using as much precaution as any of us can for this awful last year, when it comes to personal safety.
Masks, limited contact with groups outside of home, etc.

In one major way he has just gone full cognitive dissonance though. At his own house.

He had one roommate, and a drunk garage tenant before the pandemic. Already, my concerns about the lack of cleanliness and them being nasty messy roommates who break everything was a thing. Pre-covid I'm saying there were at least a dozen public health violations.

They all share one bathroom, and the garage dweller (who comes in to use kitchen and bathroom) does not wash his hands after using the bathroom. (soap, and sink is always dry after he leaves. No running water sound) He also wears adult diapers due to being a dialysis patient I guess, and since he is 90% of the time incoherently drunk he smears shit on the toilet, etc. It's fucking gross always. Cuts himself (drunk falls etc. no one knows how usually) and leaves bloody fingerprints around the kitchen cabinets and fridge. I'm not exaggerating, and I'm only mentioning 1/20th of the list of utter bullshit. 

The other roommate has two older teen sons who visit a couple days every week. The piss around the toilet floor seems to match up with their visit days. 
Alright, but off the bathroom topic...

Covid-wise, already there is more risk the more people you have sharing a residence.
This is BF+ his 2 kids part time, roommate A+ his 2 kids pt, and a garage drunk. 7 people. 
4 of whom are back and forth between houses weekly.
A nurse, a grocery worker, and a 3x's per wk. dialysis patient/ 3x's wk bar frequenter. (Dive bar full of antimask covid denying idiots, btw)

Then in I guess April, BF allowed some sad sack friend of theirs to move in too, Roommate S. This is great for garage dude because they can both go to bars together now, AND invite random bar dwellers, one night stands, and those who are generally unconcerned about covid being real, back home to be drunk there and party. 
Cops/fire department have been there 5 times that I'm aware of. Last time to serve papers to Roommate S. They are fall down-blackout-scare the neighbors types. Holiday parties of large groups? Yeah, they travel out of town for those and bring whatever germs back to the house. No big deal, it's just people's lives at stake.

I am so pissed that BF is allowing the chaos shit show covid fest to happen in the home he is buying, which has been for 2 of the 3 years we've dated in our plans for me to live in with him someday. They are trashing it. He hates it now. He also won't say shit about it. 

They are putting him and the kids at risk. He now works on a nursing unit, so that puts greater risk on those patients. 

Roommate A had his kids come over WHILE sick somewhere in October. (My thoughts here are apparently not popular either. I believe during a pandemic a sick kid needs to stay at the house it originated in until better, not spread it to other houses)  Did not even make the minimal effort to confine to their bedroom. In fact, brought his TV downstairs to the common space to play videogames on, while the sick kid was OPEN-COUGHING all over the whole place. SIX of them in the house got that cold because of him.  If it had been covid, how many people are each of them exposing outside the house every day? He wonders why I won't go there anymore? He is a fucking nurse for God's sake. He is not a stupid person. His bipolar disorder does cause him to
have some poor decision making at times. But this is just no assertiveness walking all over him. Idk.

Cops. Property destruction. Issues w neighbors now because of the druggie assholes dudes bring over, etc. I almost smashed a pickle jar over the head of one making threats during summer. Got him arrested for VERY drunk driving also. I am 43 years old and have removed that type of shitbag drama from my life 2 decades ago for a reason. BF is on his own a good person who doesn't participate in such shady illegal shit as these guys, I did not expect him to have it around us, ever. 

He apparently has really fucking awful boundaries and will just let shitty people walk on him. I could list another page detailing their antics and bs. He is being taken advantage of and it is making me sick. 
Not actually sick, probably only because I have refused to step foot into the place in months. But sick to my stomach how he won't listen to me about them. I am the only one who does have his back. 

His own kids' visits are suspended (their choice, older teens) right now because they don't feel safe there. 
One came for a couple weeks but stayed confined to his room only, because of the high risk factors in the rest of the house. 
He is allowing these morons free run of his house at the loss of his own kids feeling safe, home, while there. 
He has lost our nights where I stay there and we can sleep together and be close. 

Now, roommate Jackass has moved in some ex's grown son onto a couch. 
Mushroom dealer hippy is another one I forgot to mention also. He was a homeless dude that Garage-Drunk brought home off the street, stayed a little while. 
I've lost count. 9 regulars, plus guests?

They act like it's a pandemic free zone. I am honestly fucking shocked they all haven't gotten it yet. 
 
BF is mad at ME for (admittedly frequently!) repeatedly warning him about the super spreader set up they have going on over there with his Wombmates.
At the Branch Covidian Sect of the Chaos Commune. 
He doesn't want me to call them names, so I'm just gonna go ahead and use ALL of the names here. Because fuck those dudes.

I'm apparently not supposed to mention my concerns or irritations to him again ""until March"" which is his latest move out deadline for the 40-50 yr old frat boys. Each of the other, like 8 deadlines, have been rescinded. Call me crazy for not having much faith in March deadline happening.

He's mad I won't go over there anymore.
Am I the asshole for having boundaries for my safety and health? 

Why tf would I skip holiday gatherings with my own family and friends just to be at risk from a bunch of dirty addicts who can't act like responsible humans? 

I'm just sick of it. 

I am not saying I don't want advice, or validation, or anything else...I would greatly welcome some commiserating just to not feel alone! But mostly I really did just need to get it off my chest. Swearwords helped. Thanks, if you read it. 

TLDR: Long term boyfriend is living in a petrie dish and I don't know if I can ever see him the same way after covid. Priorities seem fucked imo."

So I guess I have an okay life, no actually a good life, one I feel grateful for everyday but sometimes it seems like if I do one mistep one mistake the world is going to fall apart

This sounds weird even to me but I’m so tired of being extremely cautious not to hurt anyone I’m so tired of giving my all to people who don’t reciprocate and while yes that is my fault, I’m so tired of feeling guilty for everything, burdensome whenever I think about my needs, everyone always says give without expecting a return but I’m so tired of that

I want more for me, no one’s ever loved me, and I keep questioning what could be so wrong with me for that to be my reality, maybe it’s because I take things too seriously (I thought for a long time I was ugly, but I know I’m not honestly)
(I’m glad this rhymes ngl)

I really really wish I didn’t want to love and be loved, it would make my life so much easier 

Anyway segwaying back to being a people pleaser I don’t really know how to change that, and if I change it will people leave me (I don’t have many I don’t think I could handle that) 

I just, you know, I want the wheel to turn to the brighter side of life, the exciting side of life where I don’t even have the will to overthink everything, where I just feel content 

Rn I feel guilty for venting, everyone around me is going through a very tough time and I just keep telling myself I don’t deserve to feel sad but I do feel it, I feel sad lonely pathetic, I feel like I’m constantly making efforts that amount to nothing, & everytime I’m happy about anything I find myself wanting more 

This also makes me disappointed in myself bc I’ve been working on my gratitude for a while now but I’m just not in a grateful place anymore & I’m tired of trying to be positive all the time

He was married before he was married to my mother and he had another woman who he had a child with out of wed lock. And then after all that he married my mother, a beautiful, innocent, happy woman who has never done anything. After she got married she found out the truth about my father. And then after years of living a kind of normal life I found out that I have a half sister when I was 20! My dad basically left his daughter, he paid child support and saw her a couple times but besides that he really hasn’t. After finding out the truth I was more upset for his other daughter. My dad was a good dad growing up and he is a good man now but she never had a dad figure which can be devastating.  My mother moved across the world because of an arranged marriage just to find out her husband has all this baggage.
I am mad at my mother’s family for not doing a good job in finding her a better husband! My mom was so great and she could have been so happy but instead she is on a psychotic break from all the built up feelings. My life recently fell apart and I just wish she had married a better man!"

Since the virus is getting so bad there’s a concern that it will get worse in the coming months. It sucks that this even has to happen. Also there’s paying for the cost of dorm, dining hall, and everything else. While I understand those factors, I feel like if I took classes at home, I would have less motivation. It was hard enough moving out from the dorms and finishing at home during winter break. It feels so isolating. At least when I was on campus this semester, I could balance socializing with working. Now, I would get to see no one. I have no friends here in my town. When I’m at home, I feel so lonely. I’m going to miss my friends. I know that I’ll return for next fall, but that feels so far away. I’m not sure how I’ll manage. I’m glad I was able to spend some time with them, but I was hoping to finish this school year with them :(

I wish I lived in a place where there are more things to do. But no, everything is closed. I’ve never liked living here, it’s so boring. Just a bunch of dry desert area and barely any trees. In a town where everyone seems to stay here their entire lives and no one seems to have the motivation to go anywhere else. I want to live in a place where there is an abundance of grass and trees. I used to live in a place that was like that, but I didn’t get to experience much of it. I hope someday I’ll be able to go back to that. I know there are better places to live, but overall I just don’t see myself living in this whole state. Even if my parents picked to live here. That’s great for them, I’m glad they like it. But, there’s no future for me here. Once I’m done with college, I want to work to make sure I get out of here. I just hope that the virus won’t last too long because I don’t want to be stuck here. That’s my only wish.

I can’t wait to look back on this as just another chapter that has passed in life and currently I would be in a place where I want to be."
kne9vd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kne9vd/the_mental_and_emotional_load_of_marriage/,The mental and emotional load of marriage.,1,2,1609373163.0,"I’ve (30) posted a couple times over the past few days about an issue I’ve had with my husband (24). We’ve recently had the addition of our second child into the family and I’m having a full time of it nursing and feeling run down after the anxiety of a high-risk pregnancy during covid times with little in the way of support due to lockdowns etc. 

He is a wonderful dad to our toddler and does his best most days to entertain her, take her to park and play games etc. He’s a loving husband to me, very affectionate and caring and tries his best to look after me as I’ve been unwell of late. However, he is no where near as hands on with baby as he was with our first born. He doesn’t hold her for more than 5 minutes at a time unless she’s asleep on him, and can’t stand it when she cries and get stressy. So the task of baby raising goes to me, when the toddler isn’t also clinging to me somewhere as she’s had a hard time adjusting to not being the only child mommy cuddles. 

We’ve had a rough time of getting into the swing of things as a new family of four I’ll admit. One area that’s severely suffered is the housework, and it’s only getting worse. He is one of those types that “just doesn’t see it” or does not realise what needs to be done without being told (mommy did everything for darling boy at home prior to meeting me) and then resents being told. 

So I literally can’t win. I hate when the house gets a mess, it impacts my mental health but I’m doing my best to nurse and raise two kids through a spell of not being well physically (thank you long Covid). I can’t just leave him to it in the hopes it’ll get done because it doesn’t, I hate having to tell him what to do which feels like nagging to the both of us I’m sure. I’m struggling with this mental load he puts on me, if I’m not physically doing the things, I have to delegate to him and be manager of the home instead. Chore charts don’t work, he didn’t read them. Giving him a list to do by day’s end goes much the same way. I’ve asked him to do laundry because we’re running out of clean things for baby - he’s forgotten or ran out of time two days in a row now. I lose my shit with him when it gets too much and end up feeling an asshole because who likes being told they’re not good enough when they’re great at pretty much everything else? 

My Mom has come over a couple times to help out but he moans about her to me when she’s here because she can be hard to like at times. 

I have twinges of regret at having married such a young guy and having two kids with him all the in space of three years. Not smart, but I love him and my children dearly and obviously don’t regret them.  

Not much point to this really I’m just venting at how hard I’m finding life and marriage rn. Any suggestions welcome."

I’m currently in a weird place mentally. I’m living with my mother until I start college(a semester late due to covid this year). I haven’t worked in a few months. Like what am I actually doing? I look back at what were supposed to be those “young free teen years”.....I graduated high school in may....just turned 19 and I haven’t really experienced a whole lot. I’ve never even been in a real relationship or anything. As I stated before I haven’t been able to work in a while, and I do have a bit saved and all, but it just feels like I should be doing more than I am right now. I just feel useless in every aspect. Relationships, jobs, friendships, etc. it’s hard to see people my my age thriving. When i start my semester in a bit, I’ll be working on my campus as well, which is helping me feel better about not accomplishing anything right now/ previously. But like, I feel so much time has been lost with me not bettering my life. What I’ve written is all over the place and juvenile considering there are people with extreme hardships out there, but I’ve been feeling bad and wanting to vent. Hoping for a better year.

In public I see couples kissing, hugging and being so in love and inside I cry. I see my friends who were single when I finished high school in 2018 who have found their soul mates and getting married. I’m still a virgin, never been kissed, never held a hand or been cuddled, I don’t even remember the last time I’ve heard a complement. My parents and very emotional abusive and when I was younger both mother and father were physical. All I want is love, someone to take me away from this pain but in my heart I know I’ll never have that. I go to sleep every night crying and cuddling my pillow. 

I actually went to 3 psychics in different countries and all of them said the same thing about my future soulmate. That my she’ll be beautiful, the kind of beautiful where it catches the attention of everyone, she’ll be rich might be in the public eye( celebrity, influencer) or in the medical field. She’ll won’t be from my country ( I’m in South Africa) probably from Northern Europe ( Sweden, Norway etc) UK, France, Australia and Russia. She’ll be a little taller then me, have blonde hair and blue eyes and love me forever and be loyal and supportive but the reason we haven’t met is because she is struggling with a relationship but when we do meet it will be magic our relationship will be full of love, passion and care, she’ll want a big family. I know this sounds stupid and that some people don’t believe in this but what are the changes of 3 psychics from different countries saying the same  thing about my soulmate, I don’t know maybe it just gives me hope.

My main goal in life is to be a husband and father, to have a couple kids by 25 and have 12 kids max ( I know ☺️) to live on a farm in my dream house, to have a lot of dogs and animals everywhere and make enough money to support my family and maybe a few luxuries. I dream about this life, I’ll never stop wishing for this life but I now that it will never happen. Life is never good to me . I’m less than average looking, short for my age, have a small dick and a lot of mental issues as well as suicidal tendencies. I hope she’ll find me soon and end my pain. I don’t want to be alone and drink to feel numb or find any way to get high so I don’t feel sad or cut, burn and whip myself because I so much anger. I want to find my angel 

To my soulmate where ever you are I LOVE YOU, I pray for your safety, health and happiness. Please find me, I can’t promise you the world but I can promise you my heart. I’ll see you in my dreams tonight"

And then it was my time to shine.
In mother’s fifth month of pregnancy, the doctor said it’s a boy, a third boy. Mother was the happiest. 
But as a surprise, the day she gave birth, the nurse came in to announce: What a beautiful girl!
Mother was chocked and confused. It was supposed to be a boy.
However, on the other hand, father at that moment was THE happiest. He was happy more than he did when he had two boys before that.
That’s when he said: I’ll name her Noor, let her be the Noor of my life.
It added much more value to my life now. I mean imagine being the light of someone’s life! And whose life? Your own father.

We talked to each other enough and made plans with each other enough where at the moment I didn’t feel the need to extend my social circle. 

I would say that the main reason I had a few friends in the first place is because I’m not exactly the most comfortable meeting new people. It’s confusing because I mean if I’m uncomfortable meeting new people how did I make those few friends in the first place? It makes no sense but somehow I still did. 

What still makes me feel bad to this day is that when school was still in session this girl who’s locker was next to mine would always say “Hi (my name)” or “How was your day?” and even though I responded to her at the time my mindset was “Why is this girl who I don’t know talking to me?” And I think she caught on to that. Now I know that she was just being nice, but I wish I had known that earlier bc who knows I might have become friends with her.

Unfortunately, about two months after quarantine started Tim and his family had to move to another city and after that we slowly stopped talking to each other as much.

I still have a group of friends that I keep in touch with through Discord but that’s the problem. See, my parents have been very strict with quarantine (which I understand) so I’ve only seen my friends in person once since March.

When the main form of communication you have had for months is through texts it isn’t a surprise that your social skills while talking to people in person gets worse and that’s what has happened to me.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can improve my social skills? Any help would be much appreciated.

TLDR: Bc of quarantine my social skills while talking to people in person have gotten a lot worse and I’m not sure what to do."

I was in the 99th percentile for written language. I know that rationally the tests are a flawed system, but I didn't then, and I was happy.

But when I went to high school I started downhill, and now I'm 21 and can barely do simple math. I got diagnosed with dyslexia, dyscalculia and GAD, then social anxiety, then ADHD, and now autism spectrum disorder. 

It's to the point now that I try to play D&D with my friends and I can't calculate my own attack rolls, which is pathetic because I only attack once. They're all lawyers or STEM field graduates meanwhile I'm not even halfway through an associates because I can't even take a complete part-time coarse load without trying to kill myself halfway through the semester. I don't have health insurance anymore because I'm out of school and my job doesn't provide it, and I know that everyone else detests me for it. My parents tell me it's okay but I can see how much they wish they had an ""easy"" child. 

I don't have any real friends either, because I can only handle talking to people for a couple hours before I have to close myself off again, and work (or school, before I dropped out) sucks most of my time away. I have a girlfriend but I'm always scared I'll do something to make her leave me. I can't comprehend basic ideas like how government functions or deductive/inductive reasoning, I can't study because I can't read books anymore (no attention span) and I don't have any empathy so I just guess how other people are feeling all the time (spoiler: I think everyone is angry and hates me).

I just can't see it getting better. I keep pretending I'm happy but therapy isn't working anymore so I can't think of any bright lights in my future. I just wish I had the skills to make my life worth living."

Tldr: step mom and my dad are on drugs bad. They claim their behavior  is due to severe psychological issues and neurological misfires. Step mom is delusional and believes she's being drugged with feteynol and I think she believes it herself. She is in full psychosis and I'm scared for their lives. I need advice. 

So..I keep rerighting this because I don't want to add all the sob story and trauma..i just need to rant about the current situation.. This is a bit long though so bare with me. 

Basically my step mom and dad have been on and off on drugs for as long as I can remember. I lived with my mom but my step siblings had no choice but to live with them. We were all used to the drugs and sneaking around but we were all taken care of. My dad never missed a day of work and they always put aside time for us kids. Bad habits aside, atleast they stayed good parents. (Usually) 

Well the drugs got bad recently and my step brother and sister moved out within hours of a huge fight. Step mom was acting eradict, staying up all hours of the night, fighting, breaking things, saying "" I'm afraid I'm going to hurt the baby"" (her grandbaby that is living with them) my sister finally had enough and left. I didn't know the extent of what was going on until I visited on Christmas eve...

My step mom has always been loving and intelligent. A good talker and super silly.  Normally I would be embraced as soon as I walked in but this time I was really taken aback. She was in her room rummaging through things and I said hey how are you? And she responded with this long explanation about how her body is growing glass and she has found 500 peices of glass comimg out of her foot. I was obviously in shock when I heard this. By the time she left the room she was stumbling and slurring claiming that it was her vertigo (she always claimed that her highs were just her vertigo acting up) her eyes were rolling all around. She kept dozing off waking up, rambling, and then asleep again. I have never seen her like this. My sister wasn't fazed, this is what she's been dealing with for months. 

My dad on the other hand is his normal self for the most part, he cut back on drinking from a 12 pack a day to a 6 pack a month, he even switched from cigs to a vape. Hes a big goof ball and it was nice seeing that side of him still.. but he's so sickly skinny.. my dad was always been super muscular and tall. His severe back injuries and surgeries obviously have had an impact on muscle mass but I've never seen him so skinny before, and it happened within a few months. He's struggled with heroin on and off the last few years after his brother overdosed. I'm afraid he's using it again. 

And being the understanding gullible person I am, And even with all these signs stated above, they convinced me that step mom has severe psychological issues and health issues that doctors won't look into. I was made to believe that my dad randomly passing out were possibly mini strokes. And that step moms passing out were neurological misfires and it'll happen for a few days at a time..he told me he'll take her to the ER if it continues for more than 24 hours... (obviously bc she won't be high anymore) 

It took a lot of reflection for me to realize I was being deceived. It sounds so obvious but they've always been ""honest"" about their drug use in the past so they're being  honest with me now right? 

Step mom also told my sister that she believes she's being drugged and that's the cause of her health issues. She buys percs of the street for her pain and claimed it's being laced with feteynol. And i genuinely think she actually believes this. I think she's completely delusional from all the meth and past childhood abuse that's been brought to the surface. Shes also self harming and is covered in cuts. 

To top it all off, they're  in contact with family that are HEAVILY on meth and heroin so much so,, that they're not even human beings anymore. My cousin is killing himself with heroin and my aunt and uncle are on meth.. those 3 are living with my grandparents, and 3 cousins (one of them being only 6 years old) my grandparents are too nice for their own good and won't kick them out, unfortunately it is enabling the drug use and they're blind to it. Even though they recently lost their son to heroin.

With all of this going on, My dad also just won a lawsuit for a car accident and now has $ 20,000 at their disposal...I think it's pretty obvious where it's gonna go as much as he says it's going to stay in the savings. 

I'm just so so sick to my stomach and frustrated with everything. I'm desperate..how can I help? When my sister confronted them it ended horribly. They called it disrespectful because it's their house and they provide everything they need and blah blah blah. I can't lose any more family to drugs. I've already lost 2 uncles to heroin. I cannot lose my dad and step mom, I feel like im.at a breaking point and im.not even there living it.."

He made it so hard for me to leave, when I had to leave because I'd discovered myself as a severe codependent and needed to be alone. Right from the day I met him he knew aloneness is what I needed, to explore myself, my sexuality. I'd not long left my partner before that to do exactly that (all I'd known my entire adolescence and early adulthood was being in a relationship, plus a narc and controlling mother in my childhood. I needed to heal).
We were housemates first, then lovers. He put the pressure one just enough for me to disregard my own shit and date him. And fuck I was and am in love but Christ it was a turbulent relationship. Only a couple of months but it's shaken me to my absolute core. I tried to leave 3 times. The first time I just... Got back in bed with him when he asked and we resumed the relationship anyway. Second time we broke up, and I moved to my dad's. I went running back. And then finally, a week later I cut it off for good. This was far from a good healthy play on my behalf, but I was poured on with words of him already being jealous of my next 'boyfriend'. He convinced me I was only afraid, and wrong for being so, rather than knowing my deeper truth of needing independence. He screamed at me that he'll never ever ever ever (ever) trust anyone again. Saying he'll definitely miss me more than I him. 
And I know it's my choice to be alone, but I recently went to message him to apologize for the way I behaved and some of the awful things I'd said, and on the way to his profile discovered he was, just a few months later, seeing someone else already. She was able to commit more than I ever could, becoming Facebook official and sharing photos. They look happy. But it stings so fucking much. How can you claim to love me so much, saying you've never felt this way, the chemistry was unreal, and yet just. Move on. And be fine. While I'm still here, alone, picking up the pieces and dealing with all of your bullshit you unloaded and projected onto me, still. My two relationships before this one lasted much much longer and were much healthier and still, they moved on before I could. Am I really that replaceable? 
All I can do now is just try to love myself and continue to heal. But you wanted this, you wanted me, I gave every part of me to you, and you... Tore me apart from the inside out.
We were both selfish, it was toxic. I don't know anymore. I just want to be okay yet here I am wondering if I'll ever be able to have a healthy relationship with the amount of walls and protection I've built for myself over my entire life, with this switch in my brain that flicks involuntarily when I entered a relationship to drop my own life for theirs.
And they can all just be happy. Every ex is still with the same partner now. Like I was just the stepping stone confused with real love. I don't fucking know anymore"

If even one person reads this and reconsiders some things, this was worth it.)

This text is both a confession and a story to maybe inspire others to reflect upon their behaviours. While I use gender-neutral language, it is no secret that men, especially under the age of 30 by my estimate, especially those that spend a lot of their time on the internet, are much more in danger when it comes to certain bad consequences of internet usage. So if you belong into that group, this may be a good opportunity to reflect on what you consume and how much.

I try to make it as short as possible, but a few facts have to be known about me to put some things into context:

I have psychological disorders that lead to depression and other symptoms which make it impossible for me to work until this day, quite possibly my entire life. Which is why I had to develop or construct defense mechanisms to get out of certain situations I had the need to protect myself of. One of the best tools I found was reason and arguing, specifically used with eloquent rhetoric - as a teenager I was the definition of the ""debate me""-guy, logical reasons for behaviours are everything, feelings aren't arguments and so on. It worked well in certain areas (being able to calmly explain what the exact problem is with my illnesses and what does or doesn't make sense); in others not so well (you can't exactly debate a girl into making out with you).

Overall, reason and logic are very dear to me - the beauty of arguments, proofs or just the fact that it saved me so many times in my life are why I hold them in such high regard. There were of course many situations during my life in which it was proven to me that I wasn't above emotional decisions, behaviours or even fears I couldn't suppress with my willpower alone to act rationally.

But in this recent year, a couple of revelations presented themselves together that made it completely clear to my rather narcissistic, childish subconscious, that I was never the thorough, reasonable guy impervious to emotional seductions - I just didn't notice my own. They were hidden both from society, where someone could have called me out for my bullshit and from myself. It's easy to convince yourself when you're good at convincing others. And so those activities could grow.

Of course I was always aware that I'm not perfect - but there's a big difference between agreeing with a statement that really can't be denied (I'm a human, so of course I'm not perfect) and getting hit in the face with the humiliation of this reality like cold water.

While there are other addictions I developed and are harming me, what I want to focus on is porn and extreme, shocking content in general. This isn’t limited to sexual arousing stuff – spending hours on 4chan, reading about what actual Nazis say, watching videos of suicides, gorevideos, people fucking animals … I’ve seen everything. And I mean everything.

The difference between a harmless fascination for the morbid and shocking and what happened to me, or rather, what I did, is the pattern and the escalation.

Things out of the norm have always attracted me, whether it be in politics, fiction or in reality. What better place to come across such things as the internet? But even earlier began, it seems, my love for escapism into art. Videogames, books or movies were always my favorite hobbies, I never went out and played football. Well nothing really wrong with that per se of course, I'm far from demonizing those things. That being said, the internet opened up a new world for me. Endless worlds, to be exact - not just is it perfect for escaping real life in many more ways than with other mediums but I also found friends for the first time in my life (I was bullied a lot.)

But if you're decent at using a PC, have a lot of free time, are curious and all that, it doesn't take long until you discover porn and subsequently the darker side of the internet. I think I might have been 12 or 13 the first time I watched porn and hentai and it soon became a normal part of my daily life.

Flash forward to years later. After years and years of trying to get a normal life together before my twentieth birthday and finally just being a NEET (not in education, employment or training) it became clear that I was not fit to do anything productive in society. Why is it relevant? The problem that came with that was time. A lot of free time. Mostly bedridden for a time due to crippling depression, with a laptop and a smartphone.

Not to say I am not to blame but the preconditions for my consume of porn and other things to escalate couldn't have been more perfect. More porn, more extreme or exotic porn and hentai - I tried out almost every genre. Spending so much time on 4chan and the more infamous boards, reading extreme horror literature ... I wanted to see everything. The most fucked up shit imaginable. Why? It fascinated me, such was my reasoning at the time. I wanted to experience it all, everything human beings have done, the curiosity was insatiable. The shock, the high when I found something new - probably the only thing close to joy I felt many, many times. I saw videos, pictures or clips of things that a normal person would never get in contact with. I heard of the Darknet and learned how to access it. And with it, how to watch child pornography. Now, not everyone who is curious as to what this actually looks like is a pedophile in the making, just like not everyone that wants to read ""Mein Kampf"", the book of Adolf Hitler, is gonna be corrupted by it. That's human nature, many people are curious about these sorts of things, especially about things that are demonized as the ultimate evil. Again, the problem was that the combination of my life, my escapism which had given me so much over the course of my life and protected me from many things, the search for new highs of shock and the desensitization due to normal porn and of course the ability to apply cold logic to why this isn't someting immoral created a pattern of behaviour. This pattern had its first bad ending when I masturbated to child porn. When I downloaded it first I was just curious - but there came a time where I found the thought of it arousing. Why? Well it's new, shocking and exciting. And I acted upon that arousal. Why? I just did. No real thinking occurred.

It damaged me. This is nothing compared to what happened to those poor children, don't misunderstand me. I am not the victim here, overall. But due to the fact that this text is about what I've done wrong, I also have to tell people who might be on a similiar path how it affected me.

Those instances in where I did this are years behind and it still affects me, because of three reasons:

\-I will never be able to change this. I am someone who masturbated to child porn. Knowing what people might think of me when they would know and what I myself think of me is a mixture of pain and fear that gets lesser with time but it doesn't go away.

\-The fear of getting caught and exposed to the people I know is only comparable to the fear I expierenced when I was scared that I had contracted HIV. The icy terror and feeling sick to your stomach is able to destroy you in moments.

\-The uneasiness around children because of the horror that some sick desire in me might awaken. What would go beyond just what porn addiction led to. Sometimes I see flashes of pornographic imagery when I see a child. Not all the time, but it happens. This is heartbreaking for me, because I've always liked kids, way before all of that  I found them cool, rebellious, adorable, even before I turned into a teenager, if there was a baby around, I'd play with it for way longer than other kids because they were so cute. This relationship is irreparably damaged. I can of course spend time with kids without ever something happening at all, no weird thought entering my mind, like a normal person. But sometimes, out of the blue, I see a kid, maybe outside in a bus, and suddenly pornographic imaginations of that kid start to flood my mind. It's horrifying.

I stopped watching the child porn - why I don't really remember, but was it a good and ethical reason? Probably not. Fear of getting caught was surely the most important factors. In the years to follow there were only some instances in where I looked for videos of underage teenagers, with immense guilt following. Same with trying to visit a sexworker, drunk, despite being morally against it (because many women being victims of abuse in those brothels) and waking up with guilt the next day. It was too late, the were all closed or I didn't have money - but I wanted to.

It turned out being sexually aroused had become something that could override my brain, especially when I was drunk. At around roughly the same time I started to notice the usual signs of consuming too much porn, nothing being able to arouse me anymore. I spent hours of trying to find a video I could get off to. This was present way earlier and of course it was what lead to the consumption of child porn in the first place. But I didn't really make the connection consciously, as far as I remember. That's when I realized I had become addicted and I had to change something - this was way too much time I was spending with this bullshit and I stayed up way too late.

And then came lolicon hentai. (For those who don't know the term, that's anime porn with children or child-like women.) Having watched Hentai since like 13/14 I guess this ... fetish came unusually late, especially considering I had gone through practically everything else in real life porn. Shotacon (if it's a small boy doing it with an adult woman) I watched regularly but mostly because it reminded me of the desires I had as a young male towards grown up women. But the attraction to lolis, as they are called, came and I was starting to watch it and read it in doujins, to jack off.

Suddenly, when I wanted to visit my favorite site to read doujins (that's the comics) I was greeted with a substitute page of the government - that read, that the access to that site is blocked, because it hosts child pornography. ""What the fuck?"", I thought.

Well, turns out that stuff is illegal to possess where I live. Doesn't matter if it's a drawing or not, it's child porn. The legal reasoning for this is supposedly that it may lead to developing desires to harm real children. And the targeted consumption of it (if it can be proven you accessed the material over and over again, so not accidentally) is illegal too.

So of course I felt fear again of being caught but it also felt pretty fucking shit to have something taken away from me that gave me pleasure. I had a choice to make, continuing to read and watch it, despite it being illegal or stopping? I remember going to an alternative site, clicking on a lolicon comic and thinking ""i find this shit hot, sorry. But what's wrong with that?"". I researched about VPNs, the law and constantly debated in my head whether what was the right course of action to take.

This is where the love for reason comes in. It did of course play a role much sooner, but this is the perfect example. When one is good at arguing and making logical deductions, one is able to convince themselves of almost anything. People who suffer from addictions, even people who might be on a diet know how this feels. There are suddenly many veeeery good reasons for why it's actually okay to do this thing and why it's not even immoral or bad, or it's not your fault. And if there's an emotional need for this argument to succeed one can be damn sure your brain is gonna use everything it has in its disposal to convince you. And those arguments won't be as easy to recognize as ""it's just fucking hot"" / ""i want it though, fuck it"". It may be thinking about victimless crimes, how they are treated in society, when the treshold should be to make it illegal and so on. Pretty interesting topic, politically, philosophically ... Everything to convince myself that I could continue doing this.

So I installed a VPN so I could continue to read lolicon doujinshis. Oh and it's not even a problem or immoral, it's just a drawing. While if it is immoral or not is subjective, the problem was that I was hellbent on justifying my behaviour to myself. The point isn't if consuming lolicon hentai is morally wrong or not, the point is the abnormal reaction to suddenly not being able to do this anymore. Fueling this addiction. I don't know the exact point at which I realized what I was doing and recognized that I had a fucking problem and was doing the exact same thing I've accused so many people of doing in the past and that it needed to stop. Even now I catch myself thinking about how it might be okay to just once in a while ... No.

This had to stop. It was time to fucking follow my own advice and not just fight against an external danger where it's very clear what I have to protect myself from. It's time to do a maybe even harder thing, to overcome an addiction and not listen to superficial arguments I construct in an eerily fast way that try to seduce me into continuing to fuel my addiction.

But even when I cut out those things of my life - pornography, hentai, other harming behaviours - I will always be a person who masturbated to child porn. I won't come back from this, it's a part of my identity and my past. This is something that's almost impossible to face head on - I have to do the best not to see myself as some sad, tragic anti-hero that's redeeming himself, to make it a bit more bearable, to construct an identity I find more comforting ... I'm not someone like that. This isn't some pseudohonourable, edgy bullshit. It's the fucking worst. I'm gonna have to live with that.

But why am I writing this confession? Selfish reasons, of course. I won't lie to you, the idea came to talk this off my chest to maybe feel better afterwards. I stopped halfway through but continued, telling me, if this gets someone to reflect on what they're doing, it's worth it. Was that the true reason? I don't fucking know. Maybe it doesn't matter that much.

&#x200B;

CONCLUSION:

&#x200B;

What I urge someone who actually read this (and everyone else) is to reflect honestly on their behaviour. Please don't draw some simplistic, superficial bullshit conclusions from this, like ""porn is always bad"", ""don't go to 4chan ever, it makes you the devil"", ""people who watch lolicons are pedohpiles"", ""escapism should be discouraged"" and so on. This whole topic is a tad bit more complicated than that. In this pandemic, consumption of child porn went way up - most of the consumers aren't pedophiles according to experts, though - just to give an example on how many people seem to be driven to do unethical things to make themselves feel a bit better when they have a shit life.

No, what I wish for, is that someone who might recognize a bit of themselves in some of what I wrote to hold in and reflect. Yeah, here comes the cliche, but bear with me - if you think you're above this, you are like me. You're not that special, you're not some superhuman, you are vulnerable to making mistakes and developing addictions or behaviours that harm you, too. Don't think yourself impervious - that smart brain of yours might be better than eeeeveryone elses and you kick all their stupid asses in debates, but it can outsmart you just the same. I bet you like science, don't you? And facts. They're calming, everything is either right or wrong, knowing and mastering them makes you better than the others. Well here's some facts for you: you're primarily controlled by your emotions and hormones. You don't have to notice that for it to happen. So get the fuck off your high horse and do the reasonable thing - recognize that you're not as reasonable as you think.

If you're worried, maybe talk to a friend, or if it's too embarassing, to a stranger about if there's maybe something problematic about the things they do in the internet. But most importantly, ask yourself questions and don't brush them off.

Are you perhaps trying to avoid reality a bit?

Are you constantly searching for fucked up stuff to look at?

Why?

Has it increased?

Can you truly say that you're comfortable with everything you've done in the internet?

Yes?

Would you be comfortable telling it to someone though?

And when you're asking yourself these questions - do many arguments to support the easy answer come to your mind, suspiciously fast? Almost as if you're feeling a bit guilty and trying to take the blame from you, make excuses for it? Well, maybe (and I say that seriously, it could just be an indicator) there's something going wrong right now. Doesn't have to be hardcore porn, violent videos or other dark things. Could also be alcohol. Or Social Media. Sports. Videogames. Anime. Reading books. Using Reddit. Youtube. Drugs. Visiting sexworkers. Using 4chan. Watching TV. Going to bed too late. Masturbation in general. Using Online Dating platforms. Netflix. Gambling. Smoking. Self-harm. Overusing Newsplatforms. Fast food. Smartphone usage. Shopping. Hooking up. Working. Debating strangers online.

The list is endless. No, of course not everyone is in immediate danger of doing the same things I did. But everyone, because they are human, is in danger of adopting behaviours that are addicting and damaging. It's just in our brains and new technologies make it easier than ever to get addicted to some things.

I would recommend everyone to educate themselves on the topics of dopamine and social media / the internet and on what porn in general can do to your brain.

&#x200B;

Lastly ... the internet is surely one of the most magnificent innovations of mankind. But don't think it doesn't have dangers, because it does - and most of all, recognize, that you're not invulnerable to those dangers."

Remove goggles.

Wash goggles and place on clean surface

Wash your hands

Remove face mask

Clean washable parts of reusable N95 and place on clean surface

Wash your hands.

Drink as much water as you can from clean water bottle

Wash your hands

Replace N95 mask

Wash your hands

The opportunity to drink water never came because of the high acuity and staffing of the day. Yesterday I talked to my coworkers about it, and found out that I was part of the majority of people who also didn’t have a drink of water for over 12 hours.

Update: just woke up to all the positivity. I appreciate all the concern, the thanks, and the suggestions. 

The water bladder suggestion comes from a good place but I think you’re imagining a different kind of PPE than what I wear. The backpack with a straw under PPE would work if I was in a suit using a PAPR that blows filtered air over my head, but I wear a reusable N95 that creates a seal around my nose and mouth along with safety glasses i bought from Low’s. When I break that seal I have to be deliberate about how I do it to reduce the risk of exposure."

to begin, it started when I was about 13/14, my family is dysfunctional and I found myself into dark humor

that led me to 4chan, where i would spend hours every day for 3/4 years, that place is full of sad, degeneratte fucking filthy losers, but they are kind of funny i admit... I cant remember the term for it but there is a theory that when you are exposed to things long enough, it begins to influence your thoughts..

Namely, 4chan /b/ is full of gays, extreme porn fanatics , peodophiles, and untold degeneracy... i saw maybe the lowest and scummiest parts of the human psyche played out on that board.. and after being on there for as long as i was, it has definitely influenced me.

I have a destructive personality.. and as a young teen it became an internal challenge to expose myself to the most fucked up shit.. it kind of excited me i guess, like, could i handle it? i became so numb watching extreme porn and gore,, I got really into incest porn and man that fucked me up, i never saw myself being that but you would read stories that real people on the board had  written about how theyd fuck their family members or they wanted to.. and after months and months of indoctrination i became obsessed with my sister, man it makes me so ashamed. I would fantasise and shit... I was just a lonely teenager for fucks sake and outside of all this i would live a normal life. I even jacked off in her underwear, then i looked myself in the mirror like who the fuck are you? i grew further and further from myself.. I would take voyeur pictures of her and wank to them... FUCK just reading it back disgusts me its like a different person.

&#x200B;

But it gets worse...

I dont know what the motive was

or what made me seek this out

but i suppose out of this destructive persona i had grown into, i seeked greater levels of degeneracy, maybe evil?

To put it short, at 16, i accessed and masturbated to c hild pornography on 3 or 4 seperate occasions.... i dont get it

i really dont

That whole timeframe of when it  happened is a blur, it was probably all within a year

I didnt even like it, i was digusted with myself in the moment and afterwards too

i just knew it was wrong, and for some reason that excited me

Ive never got over it, maybe i never will... i feel like the most fucked up person in the room wherever i go

Im not a pedo, im really not, it wont make sense to most people why i did it i know.. i mean it doesnt even make sense to me. The fact it was multiple times makes it worse.. I guess it was for the exitement and because of constantly desensitising myself with extreme porn.

Its been 5 years since then

I feel like i can never connect with another human genuinely because I contantly judge myself for this and I also have  this relentless paranoia that someones gonna find out what I did.

I know that Im a good person. The event was a major shock to my being, I quit 4chan cold turkey and started working out and actually making a positive life for myself after 4 years of degeneracy.

I just dont know how I can live my life constantly feeling like im hiding something so disgusting.

Theres no way anyone would ever understand.

I feel like a victim in this I really do but maybe im just fucked up.

I still feel that dark personality inside me, it manifests itself in sadistic sex and intrusive thoughts.

I am very cautious of myself knowing what I did but I have completely seperated from myself to cope, i dont know how to be myself anymore.

I will commit my life to improving and being a good person, the shame i feel is the biggest motivator in what i do, so maybe its a blessing afterall. I do forgive myself but Its so hard to come to terms with, and I just want people to know me for who I am, not for what I did.."

kncjoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kncjoe/antivaxxing/,Anti-vaxxing,7,1,1609367760.0,"Why does everyone suddenly think that the world is conspiring against them? I know it may feel like that, but in reality there are systems and regulations in this world but you don't see those. You just see clueless people, fathom paranoid theories about the world (in what is admittedly a very hard time for humankind) based on a general fear of the world around them. 

I mean doctors. Do you really think that all the world's doctors and vaccine researchers are all in on a big global conspiracy to create anything other than the cure for this specific disease? This notion that everyone's against me. All those doctors are individuals who spent their lives studying and working in the profession and you think that every single one of them has agreed to stay quiet about some malicious interference that let's say a government has made. Remember that science is a peer-reviewed field. There are going to be billions of these vaccines produced soon, and I guarantee you that if there is something unhealthy in them, any one of those billions of samples can be checked, examined by scientists to further research it. Vaccines are already landing around the world, so doctors and scientists now have the opportunity to investigate the contents even further to find any flaws. Unsurprisingly the only evidence of malpractice isn't really evidence at all, it is just peoples speculations online about 'What they think about it' which for the average person is absolutely fucking useless information without proper research conducted or tests made. If only we had experts to do that thing for us. 

Oh yes we do, they're called doctors and scientists. The point is that most people don't have a clue about how safe the vaccine is. That is why there are professionals who know what they're doing and have subsequently made this vaccine in record time, creating with it an entirely new type of vaccine that doesn't even use a trace of the original virus which is just incredible. And hopefully it will help other vaccines to be created and more disease prevented let alone for future pandemics of a similar kind which are probably inevitable.

I watched a documentary called The Social Dilemma which kind of englightened me about social media works and how it encourages extremism and conspiracy theories by explaining the algorithms it is written on. It's worth watching to understand why people seem to trust the world less and less these days, due to the influence of social media/ the internet.

Summary: People should listen to the experts instead of the non-experts"

The first thing I'll admit is that they aren't even that bad. There have been some instances of passive aggression that I didn't appreciate, and sometimes I feel like a couple of them give off the impression that I'm a guest in their home, when I actually share the space equally. But overall, there has been nothing to really fume over except the fact that I just hate being here.

I feel so uncomfortable almost all the time. I'm not an introvert and I actually love talking to people, but there are two roommates in particular who are just not my crowd (who are also a little judgmental of others, to boot), and I feel intensely self-conscious every time I'm around either of them. What's worse is that at least one of them is home almost 24/7.

I'm not going over to friends' houses right now because of the pandemic (which doesn't stop anyone from inviting their friends over here, I should add), so I'm feeling incredibly claustrophobic and I feel this deep rage building inside me more and more each day. I recognize that it's not fair to take it out on them, and they likely don't exactly love living with me either. If any of us could afford to live on our own, I'm sure all of us would.

That said, I can't move out anytime soon for several reasons. At this point, one of my biggest fantasies is to just move out to the middle of nowhere and be completely alone for a few months, even though I normally love parties and socializing and the rest. I'm not in college anymore and I feel like I'm getting to an age where I really, really need my space. Sometimes I'll find myself sitting in my room doing absolutely nothing for, like, 30 minutes, just because I'm so anxious about doing literally anything here.

If I was living with my friends, or people who I felt more comfortable around, I think a situation like this could work better for me. But I am just so tired of this and I feel trapped. I'm even feeling anxious about posting this, on the off chance that one of them browses this sub. I honestly don't know what to do."

So I got a girlfriend \~5 months ago and got to know all her (mostly) lovely friends and her family. I'm really happy to be with her, but I just got to get something off my chest.

All of them say, I'm a really pleasant, sympathetic person. And I'm really happy having made a positive impression on them, but deep down I feel like nobody really cares about me. I don't know where this comes from or why I even think that. I know that only meeting a person a few times doesn't make them care.  

Maybe it is just that being sympathetic means to me not making a bad first impression. I feel so dumb writing this, because I really got it good, but I don't want to be the guy always just being pleasant. Even the people I consider my friends are mostly people, that I feel like I will eventually lose, because I'm just pleasant and they don't care enough to keep in contact. Maybe this is just in my head, but the thoughts of always being Mr. Nice Guy has really been screwing with me the last couple of weeks, it is just such a reoccuring theme in my life.

I know all these things sound like such luxury problems, but I just had to tell someone, even it is just anonymous people on the internet."

I’ve dealt with severe anger issues since I was pretty young and it didn’t get bad until 10 years old. During my teen years, I learned to control it as best as I can and I did even though I went through a lot of hardship I smiled instead of hitting things and It helped. Even after getting kicked out at 14 having nowhere to go, sleeping on a cold park bench for 2 days and a bag of clothes I went to school and smiled at my peers and teachers. Eventually I went into the foster care system and aged out but honestly I had felt like I was 18 my whole life I had to grow up so fast and never got a childhood and it angers me. Everyone in my life has either criticized me in some way that has made me want to break my hands from just going at a wall. Everyone around me ends up passing away or just forget about me. I’ve done therapy and it really doesn’t help. Everyone pokes me until I get upset then I’m the bad guy. I could easily tear these people limb from limb but I always tell myself that it’s not worthy my happiness to go back to who I was.Always at blame and sometimes I do go over the top but I don’t do it to hurt anyone or make them feel less I do it because that’s all I’ve ever known. I try to be as nice as I can, do what I can to set a good balance in the world, but after living the life I’ve lived and losing people I’ve lost I really sit here and think does it even get better ?

knbttc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/knbttc/rising_from_my_ashes/,Rising from my ashes,10,4,1609365492.0,"I’m 24 years old and going through a divorce. I was with my husband for 5 years and we were going through the immigration process because he was on Daca and I’m a citizen. During the pandemic, we were both laid off and on unemployment, he was making more money on unemployment than his regular job. I didn’t get my unemployment until much later so he was the only income. During this time his ego grew a lot. Our birthdays are 6 days apart and he decides to go to Florida while it was a corona virus hotspot. He went against my wishes and didn’t even invite me. While in Florida he wouldn’t call or text me and then his flight to return gets canceled. Me, being, inspector gadget I go through his email to see if he was lying about his flight. Be careful what you wish for. I didn’t find him lying about the flight but I did find videos of him cheating on me. I found them the day before my birthday, thanks a lot husband. Anyway, once he returned, we decided to work on our marriage and start all over which meant moving to a different state. After one week of living in a different state/3 weeks after cheating on me, my husband lives me because I told him he couldn’t be friends with a female friend from Florida who had been telling him “I love you” over the phone.

I felt broken, depressed, and alone. He came back 2 weeks later but he was never the same and would look for any excuse to go back to nyc, where we originally are from. He then gets a job with Amazon delivering from 9am to sometimes 1am. I thought he was going to make so much money. Our 2 year marriage anniversary passed and then 2 weeks later he leaves to work and never returns. Leaving me, a unemployed full time college student in a apartment I can’t pay for and other debts. I decided that I was going to get out. That I wasn’t going to be treated like a toy or used for sex. I thought and thought about why this was happening. The change in him was strange and quick. I knew he was a mamas boy and his mom hated but I didn’t think they would do this. I finally figured it out. He’s mom does not work and lives off of renting out rooms in her apartment. Now that her son was racking in a lot of money, she wanted her son back.

According to immigration laws, once you are married for 2 years you are eligible for permanent residency, before 2 years is temporary residency meaning your spouse can cancel your residency at any time before the 2 years mark and you will get deported. Our marriage became 2 years, 2 weeks before he left. He used me and once he didn’t need me anymore he left and went back to the women he wanted to be with, his mama. Thank god and my guardian angels, I awoke on time. The pandemic slowed everything down so he was still waiting on the immigration interview date. I right away applied for divorce and canceled his paperwork. I didn’t tell him till 3 weeks later. Once he found out, he set me up and tried to get proof of me being so “violent” that he had no choice but to leave me. However, I didn’t fall for it and I ended up pressing charges instead. Another happy fact, it was too late for him to try and dispute it, once it’s canceled, it’s canceled. 

Anyway, he hates me and is trying to ruin my life in every way possible. During those 4 months oF hell, I went through so much anxiety and depression that I started seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication. I was taking my last 5 college classes and guess what, I graduated. Got rid of the apartment and am now starting all over again. I’m happy. I feel stronger and resilient. I can now have friends and go out, no more control. I know this was long but I wanted to share, just in case anyone else is going through something similar. You can always cancel your spouses paperwork if you find out they’re using you or you just don’t want to do it anymore. I don’t think I would have been able to sleep at night knowing he used me for papers and can now travel the world and give his mom papers (his mom also assaulted me after he left the first time, I didn’t press charges because she’s illegal). If he wants to use someone and waste 5 yrs of their life then go ahead but it’s not going to me."

Wished him Merry Christmas on Christmas Day and got no response.

It just hurts so much. Half an hour ago, I contemplated sending him a message asking if we're still friends or if we're ever going to talk again. I couldn't do it. I got shaky and just felt sick at the idea of it. What if he says no?

Anyway. I knew. Deep down. I knew something was off. I've been trying to pinpoint it for forever. Sometimes I touched upon it but I denied. I leapt back from the sting. It burned too deep.

There weren’t any sunflowers this time but I think she’d still like the tiny lilies. I sang happy birthday in a whisper and I watched my tears fall onto the grass below me. I was proud I held out so long. Strong like Bull, Ma. You made me strong like bull. I love you to the moon and back times infinity, Happy birthday."

I do have a mild depressive disorder, but I’m not suicidal nor do I plan on drowning any time soon. I can swim just fine. (Also, I don’t know where I’m supposed to post this or talk about this. So, if there is somewhere that better suits talking about my situation, point me in the right direction.)

&#x200B;

Now I don’t fear drowning or anything, not more than any other way someone can die suddenly or painfully. I don’t fear the ocean and its depths or bathtubs filled to the brim. But, this past month in some ways leads me to believe that I am going to die drowning.

Give me a second to explain, it begins strangely. I started working for FedEx this past month, need a job that pays, and it’s fine work if you don’t mind the hours. I live up in the North East and a week or so ago we had a storm come through. We still put packages on trucks and delivered them so everyone could get holiday gifts in time. After they finished the trucks came back they were covered in snow that melted into huge puddles all over the warehouse(sorry for damp packages people.)

I work on the concrete floors that were now covered in puddles. Every time I was waiting for packages to come down the belt I would look down and splash them a little with my boots. I'd take the water and drag it out of the puddles and make brush strokes on the few dry parts of concrete too. Something about it made me feel strange and hazy. It was kind of hypnotic. I was really focused on the water and what it looked and sounded like. When I was finally standing still, just staring at the puddle, I thought of a voice inside my head that wasn’t my own, and it was whispering, ""we're drowning."" 

There were a few different voices but it was mostly a woman’s. They were all repeating the same thing, in whispers or distant shouts that were quite like a whisper. But none of them were pleading for help, they were all just statements. Like they were only letting me know that they were all drowning.

I kept staring at the big puddle I was in. The voices were all overlapping telling me they were drowning, but then that woman cut through all the others and whispered, “And you’ll drown too.”

I know that sounds really creepy and stuff and maybe a bit psychotic on my part but I listen to a lot of podcasts and stuff. Things that are creepy and esoteric and whatever, so I accepted the chill it gave me and wrote it off as just being inspired by the genera. I asked my manager to move me off the concrete floor and onto the grated platform farther up the belt to keep me busy and out of the puddles.

When I finished work and get home I heat up leftovers from last night and open my phone to watch a video while I eat. I love meal time videos and my feed is always full of them. Lucky for me the first video recommended on my homepage is a phobia video from a creator I don’t follow named Solar Sands.

I didn’t really know what thalassophobia was when I started watching and it was not long before I got a warning the video would describe drowning. I left a comment on the video after watching it. I basically say the same thing I said above. And I stand by the fact that this is all probably a big coincidence. But it didn’t end there, it’s only gotten worse.

I do sound design as a hobby and hopefully in the future as a job. FedEx is not forever. So I do game jams and short films for friends when I can. I was brought on for a game jam, one that is meant to be an fps, the designers settled on a theme they thought would be fun. An fps full of water guns. The weapon is water and you use it to shoot and hover. To reload you need to submerge yourself. I spent time recording the audio for it that could be used. Splashes, faucets running, mason jars being filled with water(they make cool sounds), even sticking hot pans in water for hissing noises.

We are now late on submitting the game because of me. I recorded all the sounds I want to use, but I can’t seem to focus when I’m editing anymore. I feel lethargic when I open my DAW and start playing them all back to me. The sounds came out great but listening to them over and over again while working makes me feel that same strangeness. I'll just listen to the sounds on repeat. I’ve been working on other projects instead, and have not been responding to the GJ group as the reason I haven’t gotten much done is kind of ridiculous.

It keeps going though. I like sounds, of course, and I’m one of those guys who listens to noise when I’m trying to sleep. I keep a noisemaker in my room and usually default to brown noise or other deeper sounds to get me to sleep fast. A couple of nights ago it broke. None of the buttons to change the noise it makes work, but it turns on and off and I can raise and lower the volume. It is stuck on the sound of ocean waves crashing. I tried using my phone to play some other sounds like white noise and brown noise, but I don’t feel tired listening to them anymore. Instead the second I turn on the noisemaker and listen to the sound of waves crashing against the shore, I feel myself drifting to sleep like I would while working on the fps, or hearing my faucet drip, or the sound inside my head when I'm drinking water. It all makes me feel tired.

So for the past few nights, I have been listening to the sound of the ocean, letting it wash over me. Sometimes it makes it hard to wake up for work in the morning because of it. I’ll just lay there and listen. Since that time with the puddles I haven't heard a voice in my head telling me they're drowning, or any voices for that matter. But I have been noticing more and more the number of times I will hear about people being drowned in the news, or in a book I’m reading or a podcast I am listening to. Maybe I never noticed how much drowning is referenced until now, but now I do. In that way, I guess I feel like I’m already drowning.

Once again, I stand by the fact that this is all either a coincident at best, and a case of apophenia at worst. I’m not scared of drowning and even with all this happening I still don’t feel any great fear of water or the ocean or anything. I’m scared though. I’m scared because I feel like something is always pushing me closer to this idea. Maybe the YouTube algorithm. Since watching that video, I was able to look up the name of that feeling, scopophobia. The fear of being watched. The feeling is like someone sees me and knows what I’m going through, nudging me in just the right direction. Like they know all these things are happening to me and they are just watching and waiting. Hoping to witness me being consumed by water. And I think now, in some ways, I’m starting to believe it. Maybe I am going to drown, maybe I am going to find myself trapped underwater, and those voices will be right there with me. I don’t know anymore.

Rationally, I think I’m just making connections that aren’t there, and probably feeling some quarantine induced paranoia. I’m sorry for rambling like a madman but I needed to get this out there, it's been taking over my thoughts for the past couple of weeks, and it feels good that someone might read this. To who ever does read this, hopefully, I don’t drown any time soon."

This guy I used to talk to obsessively searched for me on every social platform, he found me. We chatted for a bit and decided to hangout. I did originally (before he got here) plan to have relations with him and I have before but when he got here I was uncomfortable from the way he was acting. Very handsey and borderline creepy, he wasn’t who I thought he was anymore. I did not enjoy any of it and I said no/stop multiple times. He did stop but would continue after a short period of time, every time. At no point was verbal permission given the whole time he was here, he didn’t even ask he just would do things which after being assaulted twice I have serious boundary/intimacy issues. He kept saying things to make me feel guilty when I said no so I complied because I’m very introverted these days and don’t like making people upset.. I definitely don’t feel good about any of it and am not processing it well. I can’t help but blame myself and I’m trying to convince myself it’s fine, but I just don’t feel good about what happened. It’s not a sense of regret, it’s a feeling of being entirely violated and disgusting. I feel wrong for feeling wrong about it too. idk

I’m not looking for anyone’s opinion on this situation because you weren’t here. You couldn’t possibly know what happened, or how I feel. I just need to rant because I have no one to talk to.

(TW: grooming, violence, mental abuse) just a heads up this might be long.
So when I was around 11, my half brother (moms son, we don’t have the same dad) who was around 19 at the time, came into our lives from our home country to live with us in the United States. I was ecstatic, I had always wanted a sibling being an only child up until that point. As we got close and gained my trust, He slowly began to behave odd around me, and would constantly bring up sexual topics. I would get uneasy, and he would become enraged when I wanted to avoid him. He would start to lock his room with me in it until I cried and would mentally abuse me. Somehow, he convinced my young self that being in close contact with him at all times was a normal sibling thing to do, and would always ask me to “hug” him which he would then take the opportunity to subtly feel me. I knew how terrible it felt, but I couldn’t come to terms with the fact that I was being fully groomed by someone I had developed so much trust for. I would just excuse him in my head by thinking that maybe hopefully, his hand slipped. I wish I hadn’t been so naive and fully told my parents. I was so hesitant to say anything to my mother, but I did complain on how violent he was to me, to which she would respond that it was my fault for “playing around” too much. I was around 14 now and he was well over the age of 22, and I began to recognize the dangerous behavior, and finally put my foot down. He ended up punching me right in the face. I told my parents and they simply told him off. He swore to them that he wouldn’t do such thing and my mother bought it. Then soon after at night, he looked over my bed and asked me to have THAT with him. I was behind terrified and thought that this was it for me. I pretended to stay asleep and he eventually left. I ran to my parents room and told them everything, this was the last straw. My mother was deeply shook, and consoled me that night. But after that, she completely chose not to believe me and tried to convince me that I had heard wrong. I tried to plead with her with everything, but she didn’t believe me, and instead said it was my fault for “provoking” him. I almost couldn’t recognize my hard working amazing sweet mother. It pains me to this day that she couldn’t believe her own daughter. I’ve had nightmares most nights. 
Fast forward to this morning, I’m now 17, she ends up pulling a knife on me after I bring it up to her in tears because it still bothers me that she was never emotionally there for me after such traumatic incident, and he still lives with us, except we entirely avoid each other and haven’t spoken a word at all. She was livid, and claimed that she didn’t know what else I wanted her to do about it. I’ll admit that I wasn’t very calm either, I threw all my emotional baggage at her, I felt that it was only fair. I told her that what I wanted was for her to believe me and atleast give me some motherly consoling words. After beating me with the nearest object, she held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill herself along with me because everyone lately was “hurting her so much” I was so scared and shocked and all I could do was gape at her. As quickly as it came over her, it left and she put the knife down and said the “devil came into” her at the moment. She then left to work in a hurry, but not before shaking my hand and saying happy New Years, almost like she was saying goodbye to me forever. I’m just scared now, I don’t know how to deal with this, and I don’t want to involve my father in this, he’s not really emotionally available with us in terms of that topic. You can almost say he’s a coward, as he has always brushed me off when I spoke to him about it after the incident. I’m not sure what to do with myself, my beautiful and amazing mother isn’t who I thought she was. Was I in the wrong for bringing it up again? I’m torn. 

Btw, I’m sorry this is so long, I just had to get it off my chest."

Never had a gf or bf because I've never rushed into things. I'm looking for someone really good enough. 

I've always liked girls, however, as I got older, I started to see I liked guys too. Since using tinder and via different jobs, I've had complements from guys (and over 100 likes on tinder) and met up with a couple of guys to see if we'd be right for eachother but nothing at all from girls. 

Does anyone know why? I don't get it other than becuase I'm not tall? (not posting height but a bit below average)

Any advice would be great, thank you :)

(Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to have a bf, I might even want one more. However, I've always wondered why girls never like me yet many guys do)."

kn8v9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kn8v9o/i_struggle_with_gaining_confidence/,I struggle with gaining confidence,1,1,1609356442.0,"

The title speaks for itself: Im a 17 year old student who’s really struggling gaining confidence. I always see online that people say that you won’t be happy if you don’t love yourself first. That’s why I’ve been trying to gain more confidence this past year. It’s been really hard. 

I started developing insecurities about my looks when i was like 10/11 years old. I’ve felt really ugly and hideous for a long time now. Recently, I’ve been kind of gaining more confidence in my appearance. I am still ugly most of the times, but I’ve finally found a clothing style that i think fits me. It’s really hard for me to gain confidence in my appearance because ever since my childhood, people have been telling me that i’m ugly. Almost everyone i’ve met and became close with has told me that i was ugly. That really sticks with you. Countless of people in school have told me that i was ugly. I’ve been having a hard time becoming confident because of this.

Now we’ll talk about my inner insecurities. I am really insecure about myself as a person. I don’t like myself. I don’t have much friends, and the friends that i do have, are just school friends. Im that friend who’s irrelevant and nobody cares about. I’ve always been disliked by almost everyone in school. Sometimes i don’t even do anything but people still manage to hate and make fun of me. Ever since i started high school, people hated me. So many people talk shit about me everyday and I don’t know what to do about that. I have no idea how to defend myself against all of these people. I’m sure that most of my “friends” also secretly dislike me, so that’s also great. I’m just a really unlikeable person and I don’t know how to fix that. I’m really awkward with most people and I can’t really be completely myself with my friends. I seem so boring to everyone when i’m actually very outgoing when i’m with my family.

This part is still about myself as a person. I have no talents. I’m not good in anything. I’m HORRIBLE at sports and everyone hates me because of that. I have SO much anxiety in PE. Everyone always screams and laughs at me when i do something. I’m also bad at art or literally anything else. I’m also not that smart.

I’m just such a loser. I am ugly, have no friends or talents. Life just sucks for me. Yes, im happy and confident sometimes, but that disappears quickly because of others. How do i get genuinely confident? How do i not care about the fact that everyone hates me? I just want to be happy and confident."

Like that small spinning top in Inception, all it takes is a fleeting thought. “What if this is the beginning of the end?”

He already told me that he has commitment issues. “In the past I’ve been with...problematic women.” he said. “I like spending time with you, and I’m happy to be whatever you want us to be, but I don’t want to hurt you.”

With that, we continued. But I was now treading cautiously. Whenever we see each other, all I can think of is...is the last time we will be doing this? Will he change his mind about me today, or tomorrow? 

Each message. Each word. Each minute and each hour that ticks by whilst a message sits on read. Has he found someone more interesting to talk to? Did he decide to ask someone else out?

The more the thoughts plague me, the further I spiral down into my pit of anxiety and self-loathing. That was a dumb thing to say, why did I say that? He must have moved on, and just hasn’t figured out how to tell me. He never liked me that much.

The latest trigger from tonight was simply:
“Do you want cake? You can come over and have some.”
“Not right now, I’m actually a bit sick and haven’t had dinner yet.” It’s 9pm.
“Are you alright?”
“Yeah, I must’ve had something funny. It’s mostly gone now though.”

And that was all it took."
kn8fut,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kn8fut/health_insurance_companies_suck_or_yesterday_was/,Health insurance companies suck (or yesterday was a shitty day but Reddit helped a little in the end).,1,0,1609355125.0,"I was having a super crappy day yesterday.  Honestly it’s been a trying few weeks since I haven’t been working much and I’m getting super bored sitting home all the time, feeling unmotivated etc. I’m sure everyone can identify.

Anyway, yesterday morning a student of mine passed away from cancer.  I knew it was coming and actually went to say goodbye the evening before (she was on hospice care in her home) so obviously I’m really sad about that.

But the aggravating part was I spent over 3 hours on hold with my health insurance company yesterday. Nope, not exaggerating!!  So some background info - in the US we have this health insurance marketplace that was created with the Affodable Care Act, where people can purchase plans and receive a stipend that pays for a portion of the monthly premium.  In my state, Pennsylvania, we now have our own state website called Pennie.  So before the deadline earlier this month I checked the Pennie website and called my insurance company to make sure everything was in order.  I’m keeping the same plan so shouldn’t be too complicated, in theory.

When I called a few weeks ago I had some minor frustration with trying to pay the premium since it wasn’t showing up on the website/portal.  That involved some lengthy being on hold as well.  (Sidebar to say that, they have this option where they can call you back so you don’t have to wait on hold but whenever I do that, my phone somehow goes straight to voicemail and I miss their call so I lose my place in the queue.). The person then on the phone told me that it wasn’t showing up because they changed my member ID and my wife was now the primary.  There’s NO reason for this, I didn’t ask them to do it, none of our info changed, but for some reason they decided to change the primary from me to my wife.  So now I have to waste my own time fixing their fuck up.

So I needed some time to cool off and waited till yesterday to call and fix this, switch the primary back to me.  In the interim we actually received our new insurance cards and the bill (which I paid over the phone previously). 

So I call the first person at the insurance company, IBX.  She is nice but can’t help me, she has to transfer me to another person. Now IBX for some reason farms their billing out to another company called Accolade.  (If you ever wondered how these companies get away with being so shitty, part of it is that there is so much disconnect between the decision makers and higher ups and the actual consumers.  Just picture how many layers of management there are between me, the phone operator I’m talking to and the actual CEO of the insurance company.)  So I’m on hold now for 40 mins before I get someone.  She proceeds to tell me that her record says my wife has insurance through IBX but I don’t.  And not only that but I have to interrupt my wife who is on a call of her own because they can’t talk to me without her permission since I’m not the primary.  WHICH IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR SCREWUP!!  So now I have a whole new problem to deal with.  I said to her, “well why did I get ID cards from IBX with my name on it if I don’t have a plan with them??”.  Anyway she is completely useless and says I have to talk to Pennie.  She transfers me to another number.  This person picks up and it turns out she’s not from Pennie, she’s from the old Health Insurance Marketplace (federal) that doesn’t serve Pennsylvania any more.  So then why the heck did I get transferred here?  So she switches me to Pennie (properly this time).

This lady was actually really nice and helpful.  She even said she could understand why this is so frustrating (it’s really nice to hear that, you know?).  She’s going to conference call me with someone from IBX.  We wait for 30 or 40 mins on hold together.  The person that joins us also can’t help me after we all discuss it again.  She’s going to transfer me to billing.  This puts me back on hold with the same Accolade line as before!!!  So I literally was on hold from this point for 2 hours more until the call suddenly disconnected.  I started this whole thing around 1pm and got disconnected just after 5pm.  Wasted a whole afternoon basically for nothing.

And the final straw driving me insane was that on the Accolade hold, which was about 2.5 hours, they loop the same one-minute clip of Chuck Mangione’s “Feel So Good” over and over.  If I ever hear that again I may lose my mind.

Okay, skip to the happy-ish ending.  During all this some kind Redditor gilded me with a gold on a comment elsewhere, which seems like a small thing, but it was my first time and for whatever reason really turned my awful mood around.  So I saw that (and then later the subsequent platinum on the same post) after going through my shit day and that plus now browsing the lovely lounge has really picked me up.

So thank you all so much!"

But I only recently (Post 2016) decided that I would commit myself to that endeavor entirely. At first I was excited, ecstatic even at the fact that I believed that I had long last found what I was meant to do. I thought of all that I could do, and all that I could help do.

But as it's been four years, and I've spent every waking moment preparing and researching for the day that I can finally join the political process, I've realized that everyone who is in the halls of government in every level are at least 5-6 inches taller than I am. For the record, I am 5.5ft and Male. I mean, Just take a look at Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 Democratic Primary. He was 5.8 (3 inches taller than I am) and still was lambasted for his height by Elizabeth Warren (Who I supported) and Donald Trump (Who I did not). 

And after I noticed that, I began digging into the history of height in politics, and found that on average the taller candidate wins 57% of the time, and is more often than not the choice of people on the Presidential level. I feel completely heartbroken right now, and That's really the only way I can put it. It's been plaguing me for months, and I needed to really talk about it to someone (Hence why I'm here). 

I dunno, I just want someone to be completely honest with me and tell me whether or not I'm simply dreaming a pipedream. I really do want to go into politics, and do what good I can; but is it a fruitless endeavor? Am I just inviting hubris? Is it really MY place to be doing this?"

Three years ago his dad tried to shoot me in our home when I came out to him as gay and wanted a divorce. It was a horrible situation and I left the situation with nothing and started again with my son. We had a rought time, slept in my car and it took me so much to start over. However my feelings or thoughts from that day still get to me, even more lately. I have tried so hard to do the best to get along but it never last. We decided to finally finalize our divorce and at first it was mutual he then tried to fuck me over by putting my income at $7,000 when I'm unemployed and I had to call the court to reopen the case. I've had to take care of my son full time since the virus with no help from him. My mom got sick in October from stage 3 breast cancer and he would pressure me into situations I didn't want to be in. He told me right before I left ""if you don't sign documents that your gonna switch his name to mine I won't give you permission to take him to see your mom"". I have exhausted and spent all my money on cancer treatments for my mom I have nothing left.... I have tried to find legal help and aide and no one can help me. I'm drowning in the worst possible way but I can't do it no more.... Every time me and his dad disagree my anxiety goes crazy, I start breaking down and get deep into depression. I can't even hear his voice no more without having this horrible feeling  in my chest. This situation is eating at me, I feel like I never have peace.... I'm scared of how this will hurt my son or if his going to be okay. I think at night sometimes how am I going to be able to sleep at night if I don't know his okay. 
I don't know what the best thing to do is, I know I will be judged by everyone harshly but I feel it's time to let go."

I didn't bother it the first time but on the second time around, I had to check the room and open the lights and it was my grandma having her nightmare.

I woke her up and told her to sit and drink water. I asked her what happened and she said there is something or someone sitting on her chest and she couldn't move. She could've died if I didn't wake her up and I don't want that to happen. She's been with me since I was born and I don't know what would happen to me if she'll be gone before me. I've been overthinking lately and having suicide thoughts then this happened.

Honestly, I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know why I wrote this here. I just couldn't stand that there would be a day that one of my love ones will die before me. It should be me first. So that I won't feel the heavy feeling of losing someone. I know it sounds selfish, I am sorry.

And it's not because I feel less of a man, I'm not ashamed that I'm a virgin or whatever.But there's a hole in me. It seems everybody around me has someone who truly ''cares'' about them. At best, I'm just a friend. I'm there but I'm not ''there''.

I know that life doesn't become easier even if you have someone next to you, but I just wish there was someone. It feels like everything I'm facing, I'm facing alone. And then when I retreat there's nobody for me, nobody to hold tight, nobody I can tell how much I care about her.

I long for the connection, the warmth. But I only got myself. I dread the thought of being stuck in this for years to come.

But at the same time I don't recognize myself when I get out of my shell to make an effort to change that.So I'm stuck between a stoic loner with nothing to fight and care for, or some forced charismatic character that feels like a second personality which I can't shrug off. There's no middle ground here and that's making me reluctant once more, like some kind of cycle. So either way it's not helping me socially.

I can steel and harden myself against those feelings of lonelines, as I've done for years. But at the end of the day I can't beat my own desires no matter how much I try.

I just wish I meant something, to someone. And I wish someone meant something to me."

I get a internal response of ""you want something to cry about, I'll show you something to cry about"". This feel brings me great shame. I feel like a failure.",2,2,1609351612.0,"As I stated my child is 4. I have worked exceptionally hard to give her everything she deserves and a healthy home environment. So much so that it times I am jealous of my own child. By the time I was her age: I had a belt with my name on it that I knew where is hung and when to get it, I knew how to clear vomit from my mother's prone body and flip her on her side so she wouldn't choke to death, I had been sexually assaulted and raped by more than one assailant, I fended for myself for multiple meals a day, I had an old brother who thought it was fun to urinate on me in the middle of the night so my parents would beat me in the morning for ""wedding"" the bed...the list goes on...it is not a good list.

So when my 4 year old has a meltdown because I won't give her more television after her allotment of time has been used or I ask her to brush her teeth before bed, I get jealous and angery. Please don't get me wrong I am so grateful that the worst thing in my child's life is the fact that she cannot watch TV 24 hours a day or that she has to maintain healthy oral hygiene. It is just this flash internal reaction. I am angry/jealous that my parents didn't protect or provide for me when I was her age the same as I am for her. I am angry that she doesn't ""get"" how good she has it and that she ""flips"" out over ""nothing"". Again, I know this is a blessing that her scale of horrible is so incredibly low...that is why the flash is followed with great shame and sadness. I would never wish 1/1000th of what happened to me on my own child but I also want her to grateful for what she does have and to know she is privileged. That is a lot to ask of a 4 year old... I mean let's be honest she can't even tie her own shoes. I just get this Flash of anger and jealousy and it's directed at my own child and at myself...I hate it. It feels as if I'm a bad parent. If feels as if I am failing her somehow.

I'm 99.9% sure that I would never physically harm my child intentionally but when I have that flash in my head  of ""you want something to cry about, I'll show you something to cry about"", it feels almost as if I did physically hurt her even just thinking about it for a second. I know she can see it in my face and for a moment she gets only what I could describe as fear in  her eyes. I close my eyes, I take a deep breath and I look back at her in the way I only wish my mom and dad had looked at me when I was crying as a child...with all the love and sympathy in the whole wide world that I can muster. These are the mini breaks in our relationship that I have with her, can I do everything in my power to repair them as soon as they happen. I still feel like a failure.

TL;DR

My childhood was brutal mess and I did everything to prevent my child experiencing any of the pain I did. My child acts like a child at times and I get jealous of her childhood and angery she doesn't know how good she has it. It feels as if she senses these movements of anger and the fact that she feels it leads me to have deep shame.

Before anyone asks...Yes, I am in therapy."

I’m now 26 (f) and he’s 31.

He lives with his mum, hasn’t worked in over 10 years and has been on jobseekers allowance for as long as i’ve known him. Both of us suffer/ have suffered with depression and anxiety in the past and we kind of bonded over this. However, I have somehow managed to carve out a fairly decent life for myself by working my absolute ass off to overcome my mental health struggles. My friend on the  other hand literally has no motivation to try and improve his situation and as the years go by i’m becoming more and more concerned about his future.

A while back he told me that his plan for when his Mum eventually dies is to just kill himself.  He has no other family and his mum has zero funds/assests to her name. She’s 63, on benefits and in incredibly poor health so I fear that this situation is rapidly approaching. I feel so helpless. At the start of our friendship I really tried to encourage him and build him up, but he had an excuse for everything I suggested and I eventually shut up because I know how awful it feels to be pestered, especially when you suffer with anxiety. This guy could have it all if he put in the work but he truly believes he has nothing going for him.

The problem is I’m worried that he will run to me for help when his mum dies and by ‘help‘ i mean that he will expect me to house him, feed him etc. He’s never actually asked but with me being pretty much his only other connection I feel like it‘s inevitable.  I so badly want this guy to have a happy and fullfilled life but i cannot MAKE that happen for him. I do not have the resources, space or mental strength to carry him through the remainder of his life. I am very introverted and easily overwhelmed  and so personal space is crucial to my mental well-being. My friends mean the world to me but i still need that degree of separation from them, as i’m sure everyone does.  I love him dearly and as much as i want to help him, there’s just no way i could live under the same roof as him, knowing that he will probably be there until the day he dies. It would feel like a life sentence and i’ve worked so hard to get myself to where I am today. I can’t throw it all away.

The reason i’m writing this is because Just yesterday his mum had another health scare. She was convinced her cancer has returned. She’s been given the all clear by the doctor but it just stirred everything up for a second. I could feel the panic in his text when he told me and it reminded me of what’s on the horizon.

I just needed to write this all down because despite me understanding that It’s not my responsibility to save him, I still feel a tremendous amount of guilt. There are just so many feelings. I feel like a shitty friend and the thought of him not being around is soul-crushing to a degree I can’t properly explain. We talk all the time. I just feel so sorry for the cards he’s been dealt in life. Most of this is a result of his upbringing. His mum is a lovely person and although she isn’t entirely to blame, she did have a wild past that set off a chain of events which have subsequently landed her son in this mess. A mess that he now feels he can’t escape. It’s tragic.

I am terrified for the day he tells me his Mum‘s gone. Some days I feel like i’m already mourning him."

I think I have COVID. It started with horrible body aches the other night, as if I had an intense workout. I felt crappy through the day, but didn’t think much of it. When I sprayed my bed with some body spray from B&B, boom I noticed I couldn’t smell it. Tested other things, could smell nothing. I informed my mom and brother immediately. They thought it was funny. I thought they’d cancel our shopping trip today since if I may have COVID, they likely do too, but aren’t showing symptoms. 

Nope, this morning my mom opens my door asking, “Are you coming with us?”. No, what the hell?! I told them they shouldn’t be going, it’s unethical. She replies, “Guess we’re being unethical today. What about groceries?” Order online I said, but do not go pleasure shopping and do not go into stores. 

I’m so livid. I feel like posting on Facebook to shame them. I want our family members to see this, I want members of the town’s FB group to see this. This is so wrong, I’m so upset with my mother. My brother is only 16 so I’m not as upset with him, but my mom is a fucking adult. 

TL;DR: I may have COVID since I suddenly can’t smell, along with feeling crappy/achey. My mother insists on going shopping despite likely being infected too. I’m furious with her.

PS. Had an idea. I already know what stores they’re going to, do I’m going to give them a call to inform them. Maybe they’ll block them from coming in or something, I don’t know but I feel like it’s worth a shot."

I'm not wallowing in self pity each day or feeding emotional addiction by reliving scenarios.

This is taking the time I didn't have in the past to process and deeper analyze the situation. 
You can feel compassion and empathy for what your parents went through while they raised you. You can feel for what they are going through now, being a parent, whether you live with them or not. 

Parents are still affected by the simple reality of being a parent, even when their children have moved on. You can simultaneously feel sad and feel for the struggle your parents went through, without justifying their hurtful/abusive behavior. You can understand what drove them to do what they did, without it still being acceptable. You can wish your parents would be better, while accepting that they will never admit their mental illness, try to get help, or change. Dysfunctional families are common, sure. Yet narcissistic, abusive, toxic families are a pandemic of their own. The rate of these situations existing is concerning. And people are subconsciously continuing generational curses as quickly as they are becoming aware, trying to break the cycle."

I still remembered 21 years ago. It was the darkest part of my life. 

Both of my parents were working abroad. I basically didn’t grew up with them. I have my life before they decided to took me away from my home, from my grandma’s house to move with them in another country. I just turned 18 at that time. I barely speak English. When I went in the country, I was having a hard time to socialize. I made friends in school but mostly kids who were from my country. I want to call my best friends but it was hella expensive to do international call. No facebook at that time yet. I tried to move forward and fix things in front of me. Every day the seed of loneliness planted gradually growing deeper into my soul. I have told my parents a lot of times that I prefer to be home. I blamed them for being a miserable. I was a uni student, go to work then  study at night. I was wearing this happy mask all the time. 

I was so desperate to go back on track. I was so desperate to take these pain away from me. I just wanted to be happy. But no matter how I tried, I still ended up crying alone at night. My husband at that time was still my boyfriend. He was the most patient person I have ever known. He was the person I was comfortable with to talk about me not wanting to be here. He was the first person I had told about that I wasn’t mentally and emotionally stable.

It was December 24, 1999. I was in my room and it was dark. My room was in the basement. My family and relatives were upstair having a fun time. I decided to go in my room and relax but things went out of my hand. I cut my wrist for the first time of my life. I saw it was bleeding. I was freaking out but I tried to be calm. Good thing my phone was there and I called 9-1-1. I was thinking if I’ll go upstair, I don’t have much time left. I was so scared for the first time in my life. I was thinking I was going to die. I realized I didn’t want to die. I still have more things to do. I didn’t know what my parents reaction when they saw a paramedic right in front of our house. They might be thinking what the hell was going on. Then, they saw me there in my bed fighting for my life. I saw both of my parents crying and it was the painful picture I have seen.

My parents made a very hard decision and that was to let me go. They were thinking it’s much better for me to go home. And, I agreed. I went back home. I fixed myself. I went back here when I was 27. During my years in my home country I don’t have any connections with anyone except for my parents. I have reconciled with my boyfriend who is now my husband. I got married at the age of 32 and became a mama after three years of being married. 

I have won my battle. I survived and living. The mark on my wrist would forever be in me and that would symbolize how strong I am.

Nobody could fix you. No matter how supportive people are there for you. It is you. It was never because of my husband, my parents or anyone. It is me."

We'll call my partner ""James"". James and I have been in a relationship for almost 2 years. He met me at a really fucked time in my life. I was in and out of mental facilities and was living in a time in which I didn't even want to exist in to begin with. I was extremely suicidal and didn't want anything to do with myself. I was really going through it. James found interest in me. At the time, I was rocking a very ""out there"" haircut and that led him to come up to me. He thought I was cool. We started DMing each other on Instagram which eventually led to Facetiming and texting for days on end. We started dating a week after we met. I'm going to admit that at the beginning, he distracted me from all of the pain that I was going through. But I was confused as to why he liked me. Before I met James, I was in a really fucked up and abusive relationship. This has caused me to push people away in fear of being hurt. Nobody has ever came up to me the way he did. Nobody. That was enough to develop a liking for him. I ended up falling in love with the idea that someone actually wanted to get to know me. I blew it.

I have always been a complusive liar. It started as a kid and hasn't stopped since. While with James, I lied about the most stupidest things and I'm not sure why. They just came out. After a while of lying, you can imagine that keeping track of those lies can be difficult. Well, James caught onto that. Last night, he questioned why I lied about the most minor things. I wasn't sure of what to tell him. This led to him asking me about other things I've lied about. I finally, after months, got the courage to let him know that I lied to the point where I can't seem to remember them anymore. He was disappointed. He just wanted to know the truth and this time...it was the truth. We had a very length conversation involving questions about the things I have said. James mentioned that he hates liars and that all he ever wanted was an honest connection with someone. I disappointed him. I never meant any harm by it. James is the only person who I have talked to for the past year. I pushed other people away because I felt like I didn't need anyone else in my life. He gave me another chance. He mentioned how he wants me to be honest from now on, and if I can prove to him that I am worthy of this relationship then things will work. I am going to change not only for him, but for ME. I deserve to be honest with myself and with others. I'm just scared to lose him. I'm afraid of being replaced. I was his everything. And he was mine. I fucked it up. I would like advice from Reddit.

Never take pregabalin, AKA Lyrica. It will ruin your life and make you hallucinate and have delusions if you try to quit it. I regret not doing research on this medication, but I still somehow managed to pull through the school semester, and I'm really proud of myself for that. Nobody deserves to go through something like that.**

To preface, I'm studying for a B.Mus, and I aspire to achieve a Master's in Piano Pedagogy at uOttawa later in my student career.

I don't know about you, but my year has been fucking colossally horrible, man, but I still managed to pull through and get some 90s in some classes, somehow. Yet, I still have one exam to submit for January 6 (thanks to generous, accommodating professors, I have had many extensions throughout the semester). I have been in severe physical and mental duress since August 15, and symptoms have only become non-existent for about a week. I now truly empathize with people who have chronic pain or everlasting diseases that mess your life up without them ever asking for it.

As it happens, I have been in constant pain for about two years now. Specifically, I had Radial Tunnel Syndrome and Tennis Elbow in both arms due to practicing the piano about 6 hours a day, back in February 2018. In the beginning, the pain was so intense that I could not move my arms, nor could I play piano for at least a few months. But... I was in music school, and I HAD to practice, yet I could not due to this curse.

What did I do? After a few options, including physical therapy (the best thing that has helped so far) and some natural remedies, I managed to fetch some loathsome, evil pills called pregabalin, AKA Lyrica. I did not know it at that time, but my real enemy was not going to be my crippling nerve pain; it was going to be those fucking pills. (That's one year ago, at this point). I had even prepared to ask the doctor so many questions; his answers were very concise, and he seemed confident about what he was talking about, so I trusted the guy.

I dared to ask: ""Are there going to be any withdrawals associated with the medication's cessation?""

""Oh, of course not!"" he answers abruptly. ""This drug has been tested countlessly,"" and then even shows me studies (Pfizer-biased, of course) and treats the medication as a miracle drug for pain. In actual fact, this drug should be reserved only for the severe conditions of Fibromyalgia and Shingles. Those are the only two examples of legitimate (short-term) pregabalin use. I would've genuinely preferred going through oxycodone withdrawals. Nevertheless, this fucking ""doctor"" convinced me this would finally help me continue following my dreams of being a professional pianist/teacher, him being totally oblivious to the fact that I could die if I decided to quit the drug one day.

And so heaven starts: I am prescribed 250mg of Lyrica per day, and I start taking it every day back in September 2019, my first year of University. The first months are great. I feel a little high, I have no more nerve pain, I have more energy, I am more social. But eventually, after 9 months or so, side effects become overwhelming. Side effects such as memory loss and drowsiness and even lack of motivation (which was the exact opposite of what I was experiencing at first) became mildly worrisome. I wasn't even experiencing much pain relief anymore in addition to all that.

I continued to take it when COVID hit, along with other drugs, to cope with the pandemic and my neuropathic pain. By now, a strong desire to quit this shit had burgeoned, brought forth in part because I wanted to feel like a human again finally, but another loud part in my mind also wanted no more side effects when taking other drugs.

And so the nightmare begins: I start researching how to quit this drug safely, and to my grisly surprise, all of the information tells me that this is going to be WAY WORSE than quitting heroin cold-turkey while stuck in a jail cell (Source: Internet friend from a Lyrica Support group who explained how she experienced the two withdrawals, including withdrawing from a half-gram heroin habit in jail).

Here are some of the symptoms from Lyrica withdrawals: Acne, Adrenal fatigue, agitation, inability to sit still, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, aphasia, auditory changes, brain fog, brain zaps, burning sensations or nerve pain, burning mouth, chest pain, cognitive impairment, cold or chilled feeling, concentration issues, confusion, hallucinations, delusions, hallucinations (At one point, I was hallucinating fucking shadows as living people, and they were interacting with me), and countless more (100+ symptoms, in fact. I can provide the source if someone wants it).

In a state of deepening despair and fear, I also realize that this will be my reality for the next 6-12 months. Possibly one or two years if I had entirely and abruptly ceased to take it.

Some of the more dangerous symptoms include the cute risk of death from grand mal seizures and/or developing a permanent seizure disorder: I've heard the story of a lady quitting abruptly, without tapering, and having 300 seizures per day for over a year. After three years, the poor woman still suffers from like 50 seizures a day.

Now, put yourself in my shoes... COVID hits Canada in March; it even gave me panic attacks when it first started, something I hadn't had in a few months. Anxiety was accruing (I been diagnosed with GAD with severe panic attacks in the past, but that is going much better today), and now I had to deal with horrendous withdrawals for the next 6-12 months, even if I decided to taper off safely and slowly. That was August 15, the day I decided to start my taper. The taper that ultimately saved my life.

You might ask yourself, why did I not just decide to ride it out while taking a semester off. The sad reality is that I would've lost my bursary of 14000$ from the Metis Nation of Ontario if I were not a full-time student in September 2020. So the dilemma was:

* Taper slowly and suffer for many months;
* Go to online school doing a shit ton of assignments, exams and practice piano for hours every day, keeping the 14000$;
* Risk of academic failure (and possibly losing the money that way).

or

* Quit school for this semester;
* Come back in the Winter and lose all of the ultrapractical free money;
* Suffer anyway.

So, I made the obvious choice and decided to stay full-time for the whole semester.

I am so grateful to all of my teachers who have managed to accommodate me endlessly by giving me countless extensions. All that was needed from me was honesty and communication, and they were happy with giving me more time on tasks and exams. If you have ever experienced withdrawals from common drugs like SSRIs (antidepressants), you have to understand that this drug is just another beast, even though those other drugs are difficult to quit, too.

From what I understand, the medication is a calcium-channel blocker, which indirectly binds to GABA receptors by stopping glutamate production (not sure about that part). It's like closing the door to an excitatory agent in the brain for over a year. Once you stop taking it, the glutamate surge (the excitatory agent) ""wakes up"" the brain that had been sleeping while taking pregabalin and gives you seizures and other symptoms mentioned previously.

Even if I took between 90-99% of the dose I took on the previous day, I would get hit with debilitating symptoms for over two weeks, and then I'd be greeted with some relief (which I called windows) for about a week, where I still felt symptoms but felt a little more functional. The grip pregabalin has on your brain is ironclad, and the smallest change in dose will give you withdrawal symptoms. Then would be the time to reduce once more; repeat this process until you go from 250mg a day to 0mg a day. Some weeks, I would confidently reduce 25mg, but I couldn't even tolerate 5mg drops without being totally out of it for weeks in later stages. Sometimes I endured the reductions a bit more, but symptoms always came in waves, and for weeks at a time, I would not be able to read or practise the piano or do anything remotely academic. The extreme lethargy killed my motivation in the mid-August to early-December period. But, you cannot imagine what I experienced once I dropped from the 8-10mg per day, which I had held for about a week and a half at that point, to 0mg. This experience of finally altogether quitting the drug was nothing compared to the (STILL FUCKING HORRIBLE) symptoms I had experienced during the 5-months slow taper.

When I quit altogether, my body almost felt like it had micro-seizures everywhere, every second of every day, which was muscular nerve twitches. From day 1-3, I experienced an extreme loss of reality (AKA delusions and hallucinations) because of the accumulated sleep loss over many months and the withdrawals themselves. From days 1-7, I was paralyzed in my bed from the crippling lethargy. From days 1-30 of quitting, I had horrible nerve pain all over my body, burning skin, splitting headaches and disgusting cold sweat, and legions of other ghastly symptoms. I had officially ceased taking Lyrica on November 10, and I could feel the anxiety of overdue assignments piling up and had multiple breakdowns, where I thought I had given up. I even punched two holes in the walls of my room in the first seven days of the acute withdrawals out of deep sadness, fear and torment for my condition.

At one point, I had seven overdue reading assignments and a quiz to prepare for in Music Education (worth about 3 hours of work each). Other outstanding tasks included a 5-6 page essay that included reading a book, and of course, upcoming finals that required tons of studying, etc. Reading assignments were the worst during withdrawals because reading was impossible due to memory loss, so I had to get many extensions for those. I couldn't even remember the last page I had read! One time in mid-October, a straightforward reading assignment took me 3-4 days to complete with full concentration. I usually could've efficiently completed it in less than 2 hours, but withdrawals are the devil.

By day 30 of the complete cessation, the withdrawals had shorter waves and longer windows. The only persisting symptoms (In mid-December) were deep brain fog, brain zaps, headaches and milder lethargy, which continuously impeded my ability to finish schoolwork on time. But through perseverance and moral support from parents and friends, I managed to do almost all of the reading assignments (some were even two months late!). I even scored As in all of the completed ones. I also did all the final exams but one, and even scored a 95% on my Harmony exam and finished with 91% overall in that course.

Thankfully, and unfortunately, I only have one exam left, in Music History, which annoyingly includes writing 8-10 pages, studying for small questions and memorizing 40 music pieces of the Renaissance, and memorizing their composers, genres, characteristics, etc. This is due for January 6, and I'm just completely exhausted. I don't feel like doing it, but I have to, and it kills me that my Holiday break is nothing but an illusion.

It kind of feels like I've just written a memoir for myself. I guess this is in a way therapeutic for me because I can look back on this Reddit post in a year or two and see how much I've managed to accomplish in the worst of conditions. I am extremely proud of having persevered, but it looks like I will tragically not be having a Holiday break this year because of this unfair situation. If this isn't the definition of bittersweet, I don't know what is. (I'm a French native, by the way, so I might literally not know what it means, haha)

In any case, if you read the whole thing, I genuinely appreciate it. I just felt like sharing today, as it seems like there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm still in recovery, but I feel like a new person since finally being out of the woods.

Take care of yourselves, everybody, because you deserve it. You truly do.

Have a great rest of your day."

kn6nsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kn6nsu/becoming_a_mom/,Becoming a mom,3,0,1609349777.0," Let me tell you about what pregnancy looked like for me: I was diagnosed with peripartum anxiety probably on the verge of psychosis. I was incredibly paranoid that people would try to steal my baby away from me. I was worried I wasn’t safe in my own home. I had my husband cut escape routes through the woods so that I could leave with my baby if I was trapped. I had multiple escape plans in I got cornered. This was all done outside the view of everyone except my husband and my therapist. She tried to teach me coping mechanisms for my fears and ways to deal with them. She tried to teach me that I did ultimately have control over my fate. I eventually had my baby after a 36 hour labor that did not go as I planned. Luckily we all came through it healthy physically but breast feeding was something I struggled with. My daughter didn’t ever latch. She came out a plump close to ten pound baby but she was unable to latch so for the two days in the hospital she was starving and crying. I met with lactation consultants but we were unable to get her to eat at my breast.  I desperately wanted to breastfeed but I wasn’t able to get it to work. Eventually, after introducing formula we were able to go home after not sleeping for days. I went to another lactation consultant and we sat and tried to feed my baby for an hour. She barely got enough from my breast. Babies at that age typically were supposed to go two hours between each feeding from start to start. That meant we both would have only gotten one hour of sleep between each feeding if we both feel asleep immediately. I looked at the lactation consultant and asked how this was possible? How were we supposed to function with that schedule? Safe sleep guidelines said that cosleeping wasn’t proper. To get a baby down in a crib is typically a 30 minute endeavor. She was such a slow eater. I asked if I could just pump because my daughter ate a bottle in ten minutes. The consultant said, with my history of depression, I had to try and get as much sleep as possible and said for me it made more sense to pump. So I pumped exclusively and it got easier. My daughter was eating and luckily my milk production was sufficient but I had to be religious in order for my supply to not decrease. I had to do it even when she was sleeping through the night, at work, driving etc. Everything I ate, how much I drank water was all centered around getting her fed. I remember driving home from work thinking about everything that needed to be done, how hard everything was and how I wanted to give up. I was driving over the bridge of a large river and I just let go of the steering wheel and thought, my daughter and husband wouldn’t know. I would have just fallen asleep at the wheel. That was a wakeup call for me that I had to live for more than just my daughter. I had to find myself again and find a way to feel whole. I got medicated and I started living for myself again. I had a daughter but my daughter was not my life. I still am dealing with the paranoia associated with pregnancy and I am going to stay medicated for the rest of my life. I love my daughter and I am very happy to have her. However, to have her, I almost destroyed myself. When I look back on that time, it was incredibly painful. There was not much joy for me but I tried. When people tell me to want another one it breaks me inside. I feel defective that I don’t want another one. I am happy to have my daughter but I could never go through what I went through again. My daughter deserves a whole mom rather than a shell of who I was. What would happen if I had another and didn’t grab the steering wheel again this time? Mothers are told they are supposed to be selfless but in order to be the best mom you can be, you need to build yourself up first. Be strong so you can be strong for them. Also, never pressure anyone to have more children. Even if on the outside things look perfect you have no idea what is going on mentally. Mental illness just happens. It is chemical and you can’t logic your way out of it. Medication exists to help. Also, of note, calling kids crotch goblins is kinda shitty. Please don’t insult someone we really tried hard to have. Kids are people. Don’t dehumanize them. Like someone could be teetering on the edge and you call kids in general crotch goblins or something like that, and it is like, I have been working so hard to keep this kid alive, why do you need to be rude? I work so hard to keep this kid alive and happy and you just shit all over all that work and say they all suck. It is just horrible that is becoming mainstream. If you hate kids, you really don’t need announce it to the world. It is fine to stay quiet. It isn’t a badge of honor. It is just an opinion. You have a right to that opinion but there is no point in insulting an entire demographic."

I also know we’re not in communication on purpose. I’m trying to let you go. 

This year has been a whirlwind of emotions and at the very end of it I met you.. these last few months have been, a lot. I explored a different state because of you. It was nice to be out there and see other people but know you’re the main reason why I was motivated to get on that plane and go. I became very into you the very first day I met you. The actual you.

I’m starting to see a different perspective as I reflect about our moments together that I haven’t acknowledged before. I’m in a mode of reflection. I believed we fell in love at the wrong time in our lives but with this on-going reflection of our time together, we might have fell in love at the right time. 

Maybe we needed to come across someone who would help us see and feel what needs to worked on, on ourselves. 

I knew I felt insecure during the times we wouldn’t speak. I found myself thinking about you all day long. I found myself making time around You. I wanted to be in love. It’s something I crave for. I wanted to take up all your time because I was so into you. All I could think about was catering to you. It was hard to focus on myself as much. This has been a problem mine when it comes to relationships. 

At the same time, I found You, someone I connect with on such a deep level. The amount of observation we’ve placed on each other, to understand one another. The conversations we’d have to challenge each other’s thoughts. The on-going validation and respect given between two human beings who yes, have flaws and insecurities/issues that need to be worked on, but are also two human beings who have gone a long way to improving themselves thus far. 

I love you. But I also understand this isn’t our time for a reason. As much as I was dreading it, I’m starting to believe we were meant to be in each other’s lives temporarily. To show each other the amount of growth we HAVE done for ourselves but to also remind one another, it’s not time yet. There’s a bit more we have to do individually before either of us, will feel comfortable or okay or secure within ourselves to receive the love we ultimately deserve. But for now, not yet. In due time . 

Getting in contact with you so soon after our decision to not communicate wouldn’t be a good idea. If you’re reading this, know that I love you. I wish you the best and Happy New Years. Cheers, to us trying to be better people. 🍻"

Unfortunately for me, that was not the case.

In 2017 after 2 stem cell transplantations and many month during these years going in and out of the hospital the cancer was back again for the fourth time.
(Living in Sweden, so that's the only reason I'm alive right now I think, would never have been able to finance all of the treatments otherwise.)

This time they diagnosed it as a chronic cancer, they cant cure me.
This might sound wierd but this was not something that bothered me, I have been living with this for such a long time so my hope of one day getting free from this had been lost somewhere on the way.

So I have been spending time getting chemo 1 day every month since then, getting an x-ray every third month just to se if there is any spread to other parts etc.
And in 2019 they started to see traces of the cancer inside my bones. Nothing mayor but still, it's now also in the skeleton.
I actually felt pretty ok during almost my entire journey, except during some of the chemo runs where i during 2017 lost 30kg in 6 month. 

But in July 2020 I woke up one Monday morning and felt that my legs where not feeling normal. I could walk etc but there was something not feeling right. So I went to the hospital and they  did some tests, but could not find anything, but booked a MRI scan for Wednesday. 
My legs got worse during Tuesday, no pain but I just got worse balance.
On Wednesday I could not walk very good, and 2 h after the MRI was done u got a call

 It was doctor saying that i had a tumour in my spine putting pressure on the spinal cord and therefore that was the reason for my problems.
he said that I need emergency surgery today or tomorrow and that I need to go to the hospital asap.

The surgery went well, and with some additional radiation treatment it's now been 6 months since the operation and the tumour on the spine is gone.

I'm slowly getting better every day, I can now walk without help, crutches etc. But my balance is really bad. 
If I bump in to something  or take a bad step I have a really hard time trying to get my balance back and not fall.

I also got qualified to  try a new cancer medication now and it's going great, and who knows, maybe this new medication will do miracles!

I'm actually starting to feel that maybe, just maybe there might be one day where I can say that I'm no longer sick.

Long post but just wanted to share my journey!

Stay safe!

I just wanted to vent, I think its so annoying, especially because I've seen it on accident in front of my dad (he doesn't know, he hasn't seen his screen those times), so I'm glad I have a good poker face and can mask my feelings well hahah

I also want to mention that it bothers me a little extra because I don't have a very good relationship with my dad and he keeps a lot to himself."

If someone keeps doing this to you, cut them off. They're not your friends.",1,0,1609346292.0,"Ok, this will be a bit of a rant. First of all, sorry if my english is not perfect, I'm a european college student and still improving my writing skills.

Anyway, I have this friend from highschool. Let's say we have been friends for years, especially when we were younger, around 15-16 yr old. Now we are studying in different university departments, I moved out with my boyfriend, we have different groups of friends and so on. She texts me EVERYDAY, always asking me stuff, sending me multiple vocal messages complaining about something different every FUCKING SINGLE time. And because I'm a good friend, I'd always listen to her, give her my best suggestions, and support her; I'm pretty used to be the ""wise friend"", always helping my girl-friends (in every possible way; sometimes it's about sex, sometimes about health, matters of the heart...you name it!). Well, she also complains about her other friends, she always sends me screenshots and wants to kow my opinion. And then???? IT'S BEEN 3 TIMES IN A ROW that she cancels our plans. Because of covid-19, of course people don't go out as before, we all know that, but when possible I like to see those whom I care about. And here in Europe we have been in a lockdown during Christmas Holidays, and tomorrow we will be again. Today is a ""orange"" day, this means we can visit a friend but bars/restaurants are closed etc etc. She asks to see me, we made plans for today (I invited her at my house, and been doing all the chores so that she would have found a nice, clean space, and also kept my agenda empty not arranging with anyone else and blah blah blah). 30 minutes before our date, she says her mom is staying at work late and couldn't come at my house because she don't have a car. Ok, WEAK excuse. Especially because after that, she didn't say anything like ""would you mind picking me up?"" or rescheduled. Nothing. And it's the fucking third time. The other two, same story: a bit before our scheduled hangout, she cancels plans. With very very weak excuses everytime. I'm so annoyed. I also have to mention that we didn't see eachother in months, she keeps asking to see me and everytime she does this. BUT I know she visited another friend of her, a makeup artist, she did my friend's makeup and took some pictures of her. Maybe two weeks ago...I don't know. So basically, since I can't do anything practical for her, she keeps flaking me. 

Sometimes we smoke together and always gave her mine. She NEVER offered to give a contribute, didn't even mind it, and today she was supposed to bring her own mary!! AH!!! Funny. She's a Freeloader too!

I confronted her about it, and she told me ""she kned I'd pissed off"" and she ""would think the same things I'm thinking now"" and that ""it's not that she doesn't want to come"". Ok. I'm out.

What do you think? I'm really really sorry for eventual mistakes in spelling. I just want to be reassured, really. It's been a tough time for me. I don't need shitty friends."

I think I was drawn to her when I first saw her on WW. She’s really hot but then I started to admire her when I saw how great she looks now compared to 5-10 years back. She put in like a lot of effort on workout and diet to lose that amount of weight and getting toned. 

It’s normal for me to idolise a celebrity especially if it’s bout fashion or fitness at my age but this time I find it’s really out of character. I think bout her all the time, I read stories about her, watch videos about her and can’t stop talking about her till my friend noticed it’s all about her. It’s like I got a girl crush on her. I’m so embarrassed. It was worse before cos I could just spend the whole day googling her. Now I’ve stopped as I tried to keep myself busy with other stuff like real stuff happening in my life. 

I think it’s also cos she’s not that perfect that’s why she’s great in my eyes. She’s not an A list actress and some said she’s quite bad in acting but because she seems so genuine and nice in her videos and for someone who looks like that to be so sweet, I can’t help to root for her. I feel like this post is weird but it’s all I could think about this past 3 months."

I just failed my introduction to microeconomy and macroeconomy exam. Twice. I watched all the lectures, I read all the materials available so many times already. I looked up other materials and books, remembered stuff from there too.

The thing is, remembering stuff is not the problem. The problem is actually using it. I can not use anything I learn. The questions in the exam are not direct questions about the material. They give examples, and want you to figure out solution or what will happen. I can not do that at all, the questions are complicated and confusing. It also does not help that I only have 75 seconds to solve each question.

So it does not matter how hard I try to learn. I do not even know what I should be doing right now.... I already know all of the materials, I know every fact in the book. I just can not apply or use it in any way."

No matter how much I said ""that's not the point, the point is an officer killed a defenceless black man because they were black and got away with it"" they were just like ""but he used drugs, if he was a clean working man I'd understand""

Case 2, my parents say ""we accept the fact that you're gay and have a boyfriend"" when they say my boyfriends name with disgust, refuse to say when you and your boyfriend or boyfriends name. She will always say partner. Which makes me think ""we accept your boyfriend and you"" is actually a ""we accept your boyfriend and you if you break up and got a girlfriend."" Not just that but I told her about an insane parents post which showed a kids phone being locked by their parents after they came out as gay. Everything, they could only be on any app for 10 minutes. And they justified it, they say ""they want the kid to make their own decisions"" because you can choose to be gay and make your life harder and be a walking death sentence in several countries.

Not just that, but they refuse to accept transgender people and anyone who says they're non binary and will get aggressive if you disagree with them.

My dad also likes to rag on people who depend on government funding and live in council houses, calling them all lazy and saying ""they should invest in stocks because they clearly know how to play with money"" in his eyes if you live on government funding, you're lazy and should just get a job. Side note, I'm in uni and I've been trying to get an actual job for a year, applying to I wanna say around 30 places, the best I got is an interview at 7.

Just to finish this off I just want to say I dont share these beliefs, BLM was a serious thing and a horrible event, it infuriates me that this happened. As for anything in the LGBTQ. You can be anything you want and marry whoever you want (as long as everyone is consenting and is able to consent) if you want to Identify as a dragon or something, go ahead, I won't stop you, it's your life. Gay, straight, bi, trans just do you. If you've fallen on hard times just keep going, keep your morale up and keep trying"

This makes me scared to talk to and spend time with them bcs they use me to vent out their anger. Thus, making me also have an anger issue and a violent tendency to hurt something. I know that every parents wants their child to succeed but everytime I succeed with flying colors. They always want more and never congratulate me. It makes me feel that I'm not good enough and stop trying to impress my parents. Also my mother never shows me moral support on anything which kinda makes me hate her but then again she's my mother and I must love her no matter what which is driving me crazy. Furthermore, I'm socially awkward which makes me an easy target for bullying in school and causes me difficulty to make friends but in return I kinda have a dark sense of humor which has led to a great friendship and a girlfriend (that broke up with me) in my later years in life. I don't want to say I have depression bcs I'm not a doctor but I cannot feel sad anymore even if I wanted to. 

   Also bcs of my mom's emotionally unstable and unavailable nature. I got addicted to female validation which got me addicted to porn. Thanks mom.
I tried to fix it by having a girlfriend but I ruined it cause I don't how to talk to girls. I've decided to live my life solo but a successful one bcs something has to fill the void in my dead heart. Hope you guys have a wonderful day. I have a hobby of writing stories and novels so yeah I hope I get to be an author someday.

   To add more to my mental list is that I'm paranoid. This is bcs having a sheltered life and never socializing in my early years as a kid. Add it with the constant bullying verbally and physically and you have a kid that doesn't want to interact with other people but only to his games."

i know that  i was wrong to have had romantic feelings towards you, because deep inside i already knew that you wouldn't feel the same way towards me.  and i also knew that it was my fault to trust you that much, and depend on you that much, even though i knew i had no right to do that. but, the way it felt when you made me feel safe, the way it felt when you made me feel wanted, the way it felt when you were attentive towards me. those are the very same feelings that made me felt like i wanted to be something more with you, more than just friends.

now it has been a month since i confessed my feelings for you, and you can't reciprocate those feelings back towards me. you said that you can't be in a relationship with your friend right?. and i respect that, because you've been truthful with your answer, i felt that it was my responsibility to be the bigger man, and just set aside my feelings towards you.

but in this one month that i spent without you, i feel so lonely. i feel so helpless. i feel like you're just moving away from my life. but i say again, i respect your decision to just set me aside like that, because i know i have no right to ask otherwise. 

through this letter that i write, i just want you to know that i am still here for you; should you ever need me for anything, i promise i'll be there. i just want you to still be here even though you just see me as a friend, i'll be that friend. i just want you to know that how much i tried to set these feelings for you aside, i feel like i can't. i just want you to know that i still love you, through everything you go through. i just want you to know, that in case that you ever felt like there is no one that loves you, i just want you to know that i'll still love you."

I love my husband and daughter so much and wouldn't trade them for anything. now my hubby got up and is making me blueberry pancakes with eggs  for breakfast and I just...

like how did I get so lucky? how did my depression and sadness make me not realize this all before?

I feel like I can enjoy the remainder of my holiday now. happy new year everyone."

I'm going to try a cooling pad as a last resort but I understand they have very mixed results and may be completely useless. I cant afford to replace it at the moment, though I'm hoping to fix that over the next year. Still, at the moment I just feel a bit crappy about it. It's just another problem that's popped up.

kn47mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kn47mj/i_called_the_police_on_my_suicidal_friend_did_i/,I called the police on my suicidal friend; did I do the right thing?,9,11,1609342081.0,"This morning my best friend sent an extremely concerning message, one I can only assume was a suicide note, to myself and a few of her close friends on Instagram. The thing is, she never explicitly stated she was going to be committing suicide, but the message she sent pretty much read as follows:

I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your friendship. I am grateful for the happiness you all have given me. With that being said, I am sorry for the inevitable pain this will cause you. I wish I could do this without hurting any of you but that isn't possible. Please do not cry over me, I am not worth your tears. I hope one day you can all forgive me. 

She ended it with a quote from the Quran (""Verily we belong to Allah, and verily to Him we shall return""). I am not a Muslim so I'm not 100% sure but according to Wikipedia this phrase is commonly recited upon hearing news of a person's death. To me, this sounded like an obvious suicide note so I called the police. The police arrived at her house and confirmed that she is still alive and OK. The problem is I feel horribly guilty about this.  

She is currently living with her family who have not been supportive of her mental heath struggles. I am afraid I just made her situation with her family much worse. MY friend is black and has been racially profiled by the police before so I feel so guilty for causing the cops to show up at her house and probably scaring the shit out of her and her family. I didn't want to involve the police I just didn't know what else to do. She lives pretty far from me so I was afraid if I went over to check on her it might be too late. I am sure she is probably livid with me for calling the cops on her, but as long as she is alive and OK I don't care if she is angry with me.

I've never been in this situation before, did I do the right thing by calling the cops?"

I’ll admit sometimes I am off my game and I make mistakes. I’m ONLY HUMAN. But lately they’ve had some high expectations and it’s been putting me in a bad mood at work. 

No one has told me any of the problems I’ve been having when it comes to my job. Only the other day when a manager decided to talk to me and tell me that I’ve been doing bad the past couple of weeks. The communication in the store I’m working in is absolutely GARBAGE! Completely and utterly garbage. They let things snowball and snowball and then some other people talk and gossip about me without letting me know what the problem is. They just leave notes EVERYTIME there’s an issue and I don’t like that. 

I’m one of those that has to be told to my face what is wrong and how I could fix it. After I tell someone about this I’ll be looking for another job and putting my two weeks in because I’m tired of it. I haven’t even been there for that long for this to be happening. 

I’m also thinking that there could be some racist tones going on that I didn’t see before or wanted to believe because this persons work face is so “nice and cheery”.

Hi I’m M15, I want to say that I am unfamiliar Social Anxiety but I didn’t know it was such a thing and I felt so weird for feeling like this. I am quite a shy person, I hate talking to people (not my friends) and I’m really awkward in conversations. I can’t speak to people and when I try to the words come out wrong and I start speaking strangely. I want to make new friends but it’s impossible. I’m too scared to ask questions in class because I’m afraid of being judged and being looked at, can’t even find the guts to wait behind to ask the teacher something. When the teacher calls us up 1 by 1 for a discussion it terrifies me. Does anyone else fear talking to something of a high authority  (like a teacher, lecturer eg) and when they ask you to repeat yourself because you are so quiet. I can’t speak properly and it frustrates me. Everyone must think I’m so kind of weirdo.I dread going into classes sometimes or even being late because I will get stared like a hawk gazing at its prey. 

My other question was I’m too scared to get Instagram/Snapchat back.

At my school there is IMMENSE pressure to get social media. Almost everybody has Instagram or Snapchat and I’ve had it both of them before (when I was really young). The last time I had it was before I moved to the new area. The people who were in my class I were used to and my confidence was right up there but ever since I moved the classmates terrify me. The apps have changed so much from when I last used it so it’s made me quite nervous in starting up again. I like social media but I’ve never been able to set up an account and not go 24 hours without deleting it and regretting having it. I have these feelings where I feel like I need to post something, or who to follow and if I get any followers in my school. Can’t find the courage to follow anyone in case I’m interrogated by class mates. I don’t fit in, my friends have it but they are not like me. No confidence whatsoever. I want to grow some popularity and make new friendships but the social anxiety within me limits me from that. I also don’t want to see my friends story’s hanging out with other people. I know this sounds like jealously and I can’t help the feeling but it just puts me down when I see them enjoying themselves without me and making new friendships. Someone please advise me."

I was always cautious when she made male friends, and I wanted to know when she finished and started work. I can admit that it might have been too much, and I may have overwhelmed her. Now, she considers me manipulative. Something I never even thought I might have been. But at this point, I get the feeling that there was likely truth behind those words. Maybe I am a manipulative controlling person. I feel like I need to get psychiatric help. Maybe I'll look into a therapist.

kn3fug,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kn3fug/employer_didnt_pay_my_last_week_of_pto/,Employer didn’t pay my last week of PTO,2,4,1609339463.0,"As the title says, my employer didn’t pay me for my last week of PTO. Here’s the history-
I was working as a private teacher for a kinder student because the parents didn’t want to send him to school because of Covid. At the very beginning, we signed a contract with guaranteed paid days off for holidays and sick leave because of Covid. The contract stated, if the family gave me time off because they were concerned about Covid, I would be paid. If the opposite were true and I took time off because of Covid, I would not be paid. It also stated, either party can end their agreement with a 2 weeks notice.

So in the beginning of December I found out I was pregnant and my employer told me she would be giving me the last 2 weeks of the year off, paid, because she wanted to quarantine before the holidays so she could see her family. Okay, I’ll take 2 weeks of PTO, no problem. 

On the 28th, I had an OB appointment and was put on bed rest because my breathing (I have asthma) wasn’t well controlled and the OB didn’t want me to be exposed to Covid unnecessarily and thought it was safer if I limit all risk until I’m out of the first trimester (4 weeks). I immediately called my employer and explained what was going on and said I would not be able to return for my final week of work on January 4th. She was upset, not because of my health, but because she had to find a replacement. Sure- makes sense. She asked me to write lessons for the remainder of the year, which I said no to because that was never apart of the contract. I did however, send her copies of the curriculum I had made for the remainder of the year so she wouldn’t be left with nothing. 

I woke up this morning with a payment of $90 from her (one day) instead of the $350 (week) and an explanation that said- “if this was a normal week, you would have only worked one day, so that’s all I’m going to pay you for.” I haven’t responded because I’m upset and want to make sure I’m not in the wrong here. So fellow redditors, do you think I should be paid for this entire week or just the one day? I understand she’s in a difficult spot and I didn’t give her a full 2 weeks notice; I offered to teach virtually for the final week which she declined. Since she gave me these 2 weeks off, I believe she should have to pay me. I could have waited until Friday to tell her I wasn’t returning but I didn’t want to leave her high and dry with no care. This way, she has a full week of pre-planned time off to find care. If I’m in the wrong here and don’t deserve to be paid- I accept that, but I really think she’s just being a petty person and is withholding my last paycheck because she’s upset I’m not returning. 

TL:Dr - I was given 2 weeks paid time off at the end of the year so my employer could quarantine and see family over the holidays. During that time I found out I would be unable to return to work at the end of the 2 weeks she had given me and put in my notice. She is now not paying me for the remainder of my PTO and said it’s because I chose not to return. Am I wrong for thinking I deserve to be paid for my final week of PTO?"

I was hanging out with one of my friends. We were working out at my flat. After finishing a set of crunches my stomach starts to hurt. Not a big deal, I just did abs, it’s expected. The pain doesn’t stop and it gets worse. By the next hour I’m vomiting in my bathroom from the pain. My stomach feels awful. The left side of my abdomen has an indentation in it where normally muscle would be, i gently press on it. Worst pain of my damn life and another round of vomiting. I’m shaking laying on my bathroom floor googling symptoms trying to see how fucked I am. Google says that it could be pretty bad and I should go to a hospital. (Ive been on my bathroom floor for about two hours on and off throwing up and I’m really bad pain). After one last dry heave I realize that I could die on my bathroom floor. I call my friend and have them come get me and drive me to the hospital. It’s Covid so they can’t come in. I get admitted, IV in my arm. I’m nonstop crying. I’ve been in pain for 5 hours, it’s 2am, I’m alone in an ER room. Nurses come and go. The pain meds help a little. Doc comes to see me. They want to do a CT scan, think I may have burst my appendix. Scan comes back, my appendix hasn’t burst, but it is larger than it should be. They tell me if I can keep down a shitload of antibiotics for a week or two I might not have to get surgery.
I get discharged around 6am with antibiotics. Which thankfully I was able to keep down and didn’t have to go back for surgery.

I have good insurance so I’m hoping that the bill isn’t too bad.

The bill is 8000 dollars, and that’s after insurance covered half. I make about 30k a year, I have college loans, rent, car and insurance payments, etc. I make about 200$ that goes into savings each paycheck. I’m fucked.

My friend who has socialized health insurance (still here in the USA) I’ve taken to the ER a handful of times for medical scares. There was never a question of money. Never a conversation about “is this bad enough to where it’s worth it to financially destroy our lives?” It’s just a “yeah this is serious, we should go get this checked tonight”

Why America? I love this country, but god damn are we just a fucking dumpster fire of a nation for not having socialized health care. Health insurance already takes 20% of my pay check and doesn’t do shit until I’ve already paid 8k in deductibles. I shouldn’t have to be lying on my bathroom floor wondering if I could die and still think “I should just try and tough it out because I can’t afford to go to the hospital” Now I have to just hope that I can get some form of mercy from the hospital for the bills. It keeps me up at night and now when I see the amount that im suppose to owe (they haven’t sent the bill yet, just based on my insurance claim) I just feel sick and depressed. Living is too expensive. Ironic that life saving medicine makes me want to kill myself because of the bills. And I didn’t even have surgery.

What a joke of a first world country we are. Richest country in the world can’t afford to give its people healthcare. It’s soul crushing."

This has been on my mind all morning and maybe it’s just me being sleep deprived, but for some reason, I just stared at the wall and thought about how definitions of words are just more words. Like we need to know those words in the definition to understand the word that belongs to that definition. And if we don’t know a word in the definition, then we have to look that up which leads to more words that makeup a definition. And then what is the definition of the word “word”? I haven’t searched it yet but I sure can’t give one from the top of my head lol

I figured out towards the beginning of this year that my relationship was based on an unheaplthy power dynamic and my own self esteem was based on rough sex and being a toy.  


I dropped out of college because slowly the realization that a life based in these things would destroy me and it was no way to live and it all needed to change.


So I moved to NYC a week before lockdown started...


Eventually phase 3 happened and I was able to start working again,  I even got a job in my unfinished degree field! 


Then around Halloween, I was hit by a car and broke my foot! 


(Oh thank God I didn't die! I'm so lucky I was NOT taken out in a way that resolves me of any responsibility!)


But I went back to work about 4 weeks later because I couldn't afford not to,  I didn't really get any stimulus money because I was technically still married! And despite being married and both of us working its not like I had any money or savings to show for our joint finances!!


With my dads help though, and of course a ton of work later, I found a great new place to rent near my job.


I guess it's nice to have my own room again, but I have everything on the floor and it makes me miserable to be alone living like a floor person.


But in January I can get my things from storage unit. 


And I can get my precious fur babies to bring back with me too. 


I'll have a real place with furniture, my fur family, and I'm going to study and work towards my degree even if I can't be in school for it. 


I have the divorce papers so now I can file for more government services,  maybe I'll even get some stimulus this time around! 


I'm miserable and heartbroken for the girl who wasted so much of her youth trying to please men in a bid to conform to society's notion woman are only worth what their partner is.  


I'm hopeful for the strong pansexual woman that will find her self worth outside of sex and her physical body. 


I have been in and out of therapy, on all kinds of prescribed & street drugs,, and struggling with my bipolar disorder and likely undiagnosed PTSD alot this year


But 2021 is gonna be the year I find the right doctors and medicine and I won't ever have to debate with anyone about my health or knowledge. 


2021 is going to be better. 


I'm divorced, and thats okay. My value as a woman or a human being isn't defined by a ring or box checked on a form. 


I'm 25 years old, and even if I feel ancient or happen to be older now than a lot of my peers, I still have a whole life ahead of me.


I am okay now but I hope to be better."

When lockdown hit, the dark thoughts, the negative way of thinking has returned, stronger than ever, just when I thought I could break free from them. The first thing I think about when I wake up, is how I'm still single, lonely, and a below average student. I'm so behind in life compared to an average guy. I'm 21, almost 22, looking forward to increasing my age count and feeling worse about myself. It has gotten so bad that I'm not even scared of death at this point, because when an earthquake hit yesterday I didn't really care if I lived or died in the end (I live in Serbia). And please don't hit me with the classic ""you're still young"", because one day I won't be, and one day I'll be too old to be a father. Ah, there goes my mind again, always thinking of the worst case scenarios. This one just seems too possible unfortunately.

I tried hard and succeeded in getting to 3rd year of my studies. But I'm still so tired from that, and now I haven't studied at all for 2 months! Also, it's electrical engineering, which means there's not a lot of girls out here to date... well, I don't know how to ask them out anyway without being an idiot so it is a vicious cycle of negative emotions. I can't even imagine how will it look like after I graduate if it's this bad right now...

Winter is usually a time when I'm full of life, the holidays used to get me so happy and excited, but this year... there's none of that. I don't know why this sudden change.

I miss 2019. I was doing pretty well, I was more social than ever before, my mind wasn't in a constant state of negativity, and I had fun! Where's that old Paul, the cool Paul, now? How did it come to this? How do I get out?

I am delusional. I am looking for solutions that have 100% chance of working, when nothing is guaranteed in life. Uncertainty is simultaneously the best and worst thing about life.

I just wrote a bunch of paragraphs that aren't really connected to each other at all, I hope it's readable. After all, this post is just mindless rambling of a depressed, lazy student who is suddenly below average. Huge thanks to my friends (who are in similar situations and understand me better than anyone), to my family (who wishes only the best for me even though they don't really understand how depressed works), to my younger brother (who is also insecure like me and wants hugs)...

...and you. Let's try our best next year."
kn1ig1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kn1ig1/the_pandemics_made_me_anxiously_isolate_from_my/,"The pandemic’s made me anxiously isolate from my friends, but it’s made me realise how okay I am without them, and that I might be outgrowing them",3,0,1609331780.0,"
Usually when I isolate myself socially I find that it’s because I’m in a depressive or anxious episode, and to some extent maybe I am. I do have bad days in lockdown, but don’t we all? And to begin with I don’t think it was healthy; I wanted to isolate from my friends for no reason other than social interaction was too much for me, was making me anxious and I just wanted to wallow and be by myself all day. But generally I’ve actually been pretty good all things considered; I’ve been learning a new language, writing every now and then, reading, and just kind of chilling out and going at my own pace. While I do miss my friends at times a little, it’s not overwhelming and I could honestly live this way forever I think. I’ve always valued my own space highly while I think a lot of my friends are extroverted and need that interaction, so this is a lot tougher on them. 

The weird thing is it’s really made me question my relationship with my friends. And again, I can identify this as a depressive symptom for me, always wanting to see the bad in people. We’re a big group, and some of them I adore and have an amazing time with, but a lot of them that are largely friends of friends are just straight up bad people. They’re racist, or sexist, or hold backwards views, or talk badly about women, or are too into drugs and the party scene (I dabble a bit so I have nothing against that, but some of these guys are going down a bad path with booze and drugs) and honestly being away from that at a distance and seeing them more clearly has made me realise how much I truly hate it. It’s alienated me. A lot of the time the bad shit they say is in the form of ‘jokes’, and some definitely just say shit for the edgy dark humour value, which I was guilty of in high school too, but we’re older now and I can see that some of them truly believe the horrible shit they’re saying, and it really makes me angry and not want to be around them. One of them is a guy I’ve been friends with since we were small, and realising he actually holds these views has been a massive eye opener and hurts bad.

More generally than that though I find I just don’t want to socialise. Even my good friends go on Xbox everyday and chat shit; I’ve not been on in months. I say it’s because I don’t have anything to play, but the truth is I do; I just don’t want to socialise. I’ve actually been playing a lot and just appearing offline. They ask me to come on, ask what the fuck I’ve been doing with myself, and whenever they suggested going out and doing something when restrictions were a little lighter it just made me feel anxious. How do you explain to people who care about you that you just don’t want to talk to anyone? I think on one hand it’s unhealthy; I know I’m isolating myself from people who care about me and the thought of interacting with them makes me anxious, and it’s definitely based in the kind of depressive behaviour I’ve been guilty of in the past, but on the other hand it feels okay because it’s really gave me a new viewpoint on who I care about and who I don’t. 

I didn’t make a conscious decision to isolate myself for moral reasons, I was already doing it for reasons I can’t quite figure out apart from that I felt the urge to isolate myself and interacting with people was making me anxious, but once I had and I realised all this shit it made it a whole lot easier. These guys are my only friends, but in a lot of ways it feels like I’m outgrowing them; I have things I want to do, I have different values, while they’re content to stay in the same town, get drunk, get high, and not question their morals by and large. I love some of them to death, and the few times I’ve seen them through all this it’s almost made me cry because deep down I do miss them, but another part of me really wants to isolate from them and while it might be my history of anxiety and depression that’s causing it, I feel like it’s made me realise so much. I’ll still be on good terms with them all, but I know which ones I want to create distance from and I know that I value a life beyond what they value now."

It just feels like adult life is comprised of seeing your friends less and less, getting more responsibilities, being less excited about stuff since nothing is ever a new experience anymore, and work. A fuckton of, mostly boring, work. No matter what I do, if I am on vacation or during the weekend or whatever, I just cant shake the thought that it is just a brief pause before I jump back into doing more work.

And getting a family just seems like even more work on top of that shit, everyone with kids are always saying ""you think youre tired now, wait til you get kids"". Also families are the final nail in the coffin when it comes to your friends, thats when you really lose contact with them. And I dont blame them, I wouldnt have time for friends either if having kids is as time consuming as they say.

And you know what, fuck that. If life is just going to be a damn grind day in and day out, with brief pauses in between, I dont want it. I would rather kill myself than having to endure another 40 years of this shit until I can retire, and then I will be tired because I will be old. 

Anyways, maybe someone older can shed some light on this thought."

It’s never been a problem at home, and if he wanted to wear a dress to the grocery store, he would. He’s very confident, and I love it. We have a younger brother (10) who is just a “boys boy”, but supports his older brother as well. They are so sweet with each other. 

Well, I have a niece who is the same age (12) who goes to a different school but through social media, has become friends with kids at my brothers’ school. A few months ago, she and my older little brother stopped being friends really even though they were always really close. After some other things came to light, my older little brother finally told us why he stopped talking to her. Turns out she posted a photo of him wearing a dress to social media, making fun of him. He didn’t want to get her into trouble, so he didn’t say anything, just stopped using social media and stopped talking to her. He said that kids at school occasionally asked him things like, “do you really like wearing dresses?” He just says, “yea, and what of it?”

I know it probably bothers him a little, I mean, mostly because it was his family member who betrayed him like that. But I am so proud of how he handled it.  Just love him so much."

I wish people would realise that once you bring a child into this world, it's full-time nurturing. What did they think would happen?
Instead so many parents are struggling themselves, some blatantly neglecting their child's emotional needs (or other needs) because they ""can't cope themselves""

It's such a damaging experience for the child."
kn0vmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kn0vmo/i_wish_i_didnt_help_my_girlfriend_and_her_ex_also/,I wish I didn't help my girlfriend and her ex (also my best friend) become friends again.,1,0,1609328844.0,"I'm not normally a jealous person but I guess this gets to me more than I want to admit. 

Before my girlfriend and I started dating, she and my best friend had been dating a year prior and broke up in November. They didn't end on good terms and I always tried to be there for both of them because they were both good friends of mine.

A few months ago, I helped them start being friends again and everything was amicable again. That is until me and my girlfriend actually staryed showing feelings for one another. 

It was as if my friend's charm went up a few units and they were being friendly like before they started dating again. He has been talking to other girls and has a new love interest every week essentially. 

My original intention was to alleviate any unresolved tension since I care for both of them and I don't want to push either of them away, but now it seems like it's getting out of control. 

Today, for instance, my girlfriend called me telling me she has guests over (her uncle and 7 year old cousin) and the cousin being the busy little body he is wanted to go to the park to which she agreed. The park is walking distance from her house but is also rather coincidentally close to her ex, my friend's house. 

She asked me if it would be okay to have him go as well for extra security (which makes sense because crime is a thing) and I love that she was honest and upfront about it. Her sister is going with as well so it's not like it's one on one, but it's still bothering me. I said it was fine because I don't want to be the controlling boyfriend and say no you can't. 

I just started wishing that I hadn't tried to reslove things between them all those months ago. I tried doing something nice for them and now I regret it and I feel so petty and terrible about it.

But I just needed to unload that a bit. 

Thank you for reading if you made it this far into my rant and also I'd like to apologize for said rant. Have a nice day!"

Why is it to easy for people to find comfort in their family? You know how envious I was when I was a small kid and saw children spending their childhood happily with their parents. And there was me on the other side of the spectrum, my parents were always fighting. Everyday I could hear shouting, screaming, things being thrown all around the house. I lived in fear. Why is it so hard for me to have a happy family? A family that I could depend on?

I tried finding comfort and happiness in my small group of friends but the effort that I put in to maintain my friendship doesn’t even reciprocate. I always feel like an outsider. The one that is extra in the group. People say you should find friends who have similar interest with you. They said it easy, but how? No one seems to understand the real me behind my fake carefree personality.

I tried to use my kindness to warm up to people and the only thing I got in return was getting betrayed and being taken advantaged of.

I only have 2 precious things in life now - my mom and my cat. Isn’t that pathetic? 

I feel so lonely. I’m so tired of living. There’s nothing much for me to look forward to. I tried hard to be happy but deep inside I know I can never be.

My abusive childhood destroyed me. I pushed people away unintentionally because of trust issue and when I regretted my actions, they already left my life.

I just want to be happy. Why is it so hard to achieve such a simple goal."

Not only was it a good cut, but she really put a lot of effort into it and was very gentle. 

I think it was the first time I’ve experienced something so genuine and affectionate. She was so considerate and careful that I almost broke down and cried halfway through. This was a strangely very intense experience. I had plenty of time to really appreciate every single detail on her face while she shave me and it really opened my eyes how damn beautiful she is. The shave felt incredible and I could tell she tried her absolute hardest while trying to act cool and composed.

She’s my smart, gorgeous and compassionate goofball that I had the pleasure to even meet. These paragraphs can’t even hope to capture my true feelings for her. At first glance, this seems fast not knowing much about our relationship but we’ve known each other since we were in the 7th grade.

After typing this I am 100% sure that she is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. We both helped each other through a lot of anxiety and depression and ultimately she’s made me a more confident and nice person.

Our anniversary is coming up and I want to tell her how much the shave meant to me and how much I love her. Any ideas on any anniversary gifts that would help convey what I plan to tell her?

Thanks"

I paid her for her time, and we sat and watched cartoons together while we both vented about life completely judgment free for an hour.  


I had tried to google some legalities and was going to ask her to give me a nude dance figuring that was legal and I would myself not look like a sketchy client since I didn't know what I was doing (which should be obvious by my googling about something legally sketchy), but the actual conversation was so quick and informal I initially thought I was going to get robbed or something.  I asked for a picture to confirm it was her, she did and asked the same.  I did, she took and sent nudes.  I figure 'hey probably not cops or a robbery lol' and off I went.    


Showed up, we sat down and she gave me a price rundown of 15/30/60 min and I said let's do 60.  Said when people actually go a full hour she usually sets aside some other time to chill and get ready I said sure.  She also asked if she could use drugs, I said it's her space she can do what she wants.  I used to use as well, same thing she does, when I said so she said she wouldn't do it in front of me then of respect (this can be a common thing for addicts for those who don't know).  I told her I'd stopped since over a decade ago and it really didn't bother me (it doesn't, I always used alone).  


So we sat and watched Archer, talked about music and shows, vented about things.  We talked about the cruelties of life, and how we both wound up in the places we're in.  Things that might sound normal, but I was able to talk about and say things I could never in my life say to friends or family.  If you get dealt a bad hand mental health-wise or just in life in general, it can be very difficult to just open up without people getting weird or uncomfortable.  But this was no-risk no-repercussion it doesn't matter.  It was nice.  She actually wound up hanging out with me for 2 or 3 hours and I think I might call her to do the same thing again."

What I mean is I hate how the men who I have interacted with treat me as less. I like talking politics and having conversations as long as they are calm and facted based. What I've notice is men do not take me seriously when I talk about my beliefs. For example I got told I'm uneducated while trying to have a conversation with someone about our different views.  I'll admit I was/am no expert in the topic we were talking about but I do make sure when I'm talking I'm getting my information from reliable sources and can back up my opinion with evidence. The man told me I was uneducated after I stated my opinion and sent him the links to the information I was using. Not once did he send me any source of information but continued to say I only pick what I see on media. Another example is with a good male friend how like talking politics too. I have noticed a pattern with him where that i think he thinks he is smarter than me. What I mean by this is he will say ""do you know what x is?"" And I'll say yes and he'll say ""so you know that x was caused by y?"" And then ends up still explaining to me what x is. He likes talking to other people with different views and he'll tell me how the conversation goes and talk about how he 'won' the convention. Well when I tell him I had a conversation with someone with a different view he tells me things like ""dude why do you bother? You know they all think the same.  Stop trying to save these people.""  Sometimes I'll say something and he will misunderstand what I mean and will go on a tangent on how I'm wrong. I'll try to correct him/myself but he won't let me even get a word out until he is done.  We have a lot of similarities so I'll make a comment about something we obviously both know about but then he'll correct my comment? Like he sometimes dismisses my comment or tells me I'm wrong.

When I wished her a Merry Christmas, she replied, 'Merry Christmas Stranger,' because I haven't been around in a long time.

She just bought a brand new car last week.

She has a baby still in diapers.

All I can think about is how much we assume we will have a future and time to do all the things and then it can all just end so suddenly.

An hour after posting about her death, their other sister shared a recipe for pizza rolls. 

I asked my husband to sit with me but he was being unkind and not empathetic. When I asked him why he snapped at me that he was being there for me because if he was doing what he wanted he would've been on his computer.

So I have no one to talk to about this and I just wanted to write it down for strangers to see. Maybe someone will be kinder than my husband.

And I think that's the reason why I don't find my love and happiness. Because as a child I had so much luck in sweepstakes. 

Once (I was maybe 7 or 8) we had a party at our school and there was such a sweepstake. And unexpectedly I won the main-price, which was a big RC Truck. At another time (I was maybe 5 or 6) we had a sweepstake at our sports-club, and there I also won the main price, which was a Pokemon Figure.

And then later (when I was 17) I had luck about my compulsory service. In my country you have to serve in the military for 6 month when you are around 18. Before that you will have 2 days of exam if you are fit for that. And almost every man hopes that he will be unsuitable, so he doesn't have to go in the military. Honestly the most guys there are trying to pretend something, so that they are classified as unsuitable. So I also tried to, and fortunately I had success.

And because of all these luck situations I currently have not enough luck in my pot left to find my SO, what makes me really frustrated.

I know that some of you will disagree with with that, but my experiences tells mit this."

When you said that your feelings kept coming back and going away and then coming back, I felt hope—hope that one day you’d stay in love with me again. I still feel hope. But will it really happen? One day you show interest in me and the next it’s like nothing ever happened. You even flirted with me on a voice chat once. I’m so fucking tired man, I just want you to ask me out again. I know you’re confused, I know you’re not intentionally trying to play with my feelings, but it feels like I’m stuck in limbo. I just want to be something with you again 

Will we ever have the same connection we used to have when we dated? I hope so. We’ve bounced back to each other many times before and I hope the same thing happens again"

For some background she’s a 23.y/o Female who still lives with my parents and I(16.y/o female) she went to college for a course she didn’t give a shit about and failed and now works part time but blows all her cash on stupid she like schoolgirl costumes.



That also makes me afraid cause in my eyes there’s nothing positive about her heres all the things she’s done that I can remember:

•She gets angry so easily and blames other ppl for it but never looks back at her actions.

•She misplaced her earbuds and told me to kill myself over it.

•She paid money for her ex to get cursed or something.

•She says that she’ll pay for someone to curse my other sister and our parents.

•This Christmas she dragged our 4.y/o cousin off and told him the elf on the shelf wasn’t real and tried then tried to make it some sort of freedom of speech thing.

•If she orders something she doesn’t like of eBay she gets my parents to pay her back.

•She calls everyone but white people the n-word (with the hard r).

•Laughed at my dads friend who got corona (then when I said that wasn’t nice she went on how I was stupid cause she has autism).

•Made all my friends who came over so uncomfortable that they stopped visiting.

•locked our cat in the freezer just to hear it scream, clipped her whiskers just so I could notice



I’ve tried to get along with her in the past but when we do talk she goes on about how shitty her life and it really makes me uncomfortable cause she talks how horrible everything is and about sexual stuff too.
I wish she would get therapy (it’s free for us) but she says it’s a waste of time but I don’t feel safe with her around, and I don’t want to move out cause I feel like she might hurt my parents if I leave, sometimes I even have to sleep with a weapon to feel safe.


So I hate my sister, 
...if anyone can give me advice it would rlly be appreciated (:"

So now what then? 

If I’m not entitled to anything, and I shouldn’t expect anything, how am I supposed to ever feel excited. I guess the phrase, “let down” shouldn’t even exist than either.

How can anyone in the world let you down? You aren’t entitled to whatever you wanted from them. Feeling let down is feeling entitled.

Yes I’m being petty about this and I’m just mad that all this stuff I read about this topic is from people who have just accepted that nobody in the world wants them and are just waiting to die, or they are and have been in a great relationship and are never unhappy because everyone wants them.

Yea that’s it, I’m jealous that no matter how hard I could be working at my life, it won’t even matter, because I deserve nothing, but them over there, they’re great aren’t they, they’re so happy together, I’m happy for them. But I’m not with anyone, and that makes me sad and jealous. 

It feels so embarrassing wanting someone to care about you and be there for you and find you attractive. 

I’m not allowed to want any of those things. But they’re supposed to happen and I’m gonna reject anyone who doesn’t meet those requirements.

Do you see where a person like me gets confused by these statements? 

I would never date xyz, whoever I date has to meet xyz requirements. How is that not entitlement? How is me wanting a relationship entitlement? 

Is it just my reaction to rejection that equals entitlement, like I can want all that stuff, but if I don’t get it and act all idk about it then it’s bad? 

I really don’t get it but it’s making me so sad. 

I don’t get how everyone finds a partner who wants them and stays with them. 

Now I’m an insecure fuck who could never date right now. I’m not good enough yet, in fds terms I’m low value as fuck and would rather not embarrass myself. 

So instead I google stuff about relationships and all it does is reinforce my insecurities that I’m worthless trash who shouldn’t even try because then I’m being an entitled prick. 

I’m gonna make this really long now. Because again I use this as my journal. Maybe I should keep the account this time, but then I always see those comments of people being like dude I see your post history and YOURE THE ISSUE. Like no shit I’m the issue I’m saying that right now aren’t I?

Well then what’s my problem, it’s because perfect me doesn’t exist. I’m me and whoever present me is, is apart of me. So even if the me in the future becomes really cool and not depressed about himself, it still might not be enough for someone I want to be with. 

Idek what I want, I don’t want a relationship, I want to kill myself and be done with life, this shit is so dumb and annoying that I don’t want to participate anymore. I hope some crazy shit will happen everyday, like America will go to war with China and ww3 happens to spice things up a bit. 

I had a mental breakdown a few months ago and am just riding the wave. I was hitting myself and crying begging my loved ones to let me die and to hate me because I hate myself and I don’t want to cause them pain with my existence.

But they said they don’t want me to. Yea I’m draining sometimes because of my head, but they don’t want to lose me either. And that really snapped me out of it. I mean partially. Like I’m not gonna kill myself and I’m not gonna do anything or say anymore things to my friends that might ruin their mood. 

I want a semi to roll over me so bad. When I’m on the highway, I’ll drive next to trucks and test how close I can get to the line, cause you know their in a big ass truck so they swerve sometimes out of their lane, so if I’m in mine still and they hit me, it’s technically not suicide so my family and friends won’t have the guilt. 

But I’m sure they’ll know, so I can’t. I like to hold hot bowls and let it burn my hands. I know you server girls are like lol k. But my hands are really sensitive to heat for some reason and it freaks out my brain.

I’m too afraid I’ll fuck up with a blade if I cut myself deep, so I just used some nail clippers and that really cuts harshly. Like it’s not sharp enough to cut easy, but if you really dig and press with it, it’ll break the skin, and I did that from my chest to below my belly button. I wanted to experience the pain because I know there’s girls who do this when they’re young so fuck it, I should feel a taste of their pain. 

I think everyone has a purpose in the world, and I’ve made mine really big, so big in fact that it’s going to be unreachable, meaning I’ll never be satisfied, meaning misery for whoever wants me romantically. They think they want me, but they don’t. Like this woman I’m talking to now. 

She gets it kind of but it’s weird. She says you are just fine even if you aren’t exactly where you want to be, but I don’t believe her, I know it’s bs. And if she respected herself more she’d, dude she’d be so mad if she read that, you take that shit back bro. Alright, I’m so sorry I even thought that, seriously please stop talking to me, I’m so fucking mean too. I’m crying right now because of it. Why tf can I hurt people so casually? Why did I even have that thought? I’m sorry I said that, I know you’ll never see this but I’m so sorry I said that, I don’t respect myself ok, that’s it. You’re literally perfect and so sweet and sexy and honest and loving. 

I wish I could be like you, I even try and adopt those things, that’s the only reason I’m crying, why tf did I let myself learn empathy? Things were so much easier when I didn’t give a fuck about any of you ants. Now I value you all and think your life is precious and blah blah blah. 

I’m broken as fuck and am just salty I’m not fixed. 

Pitiful? Ahhahaha fuck myself. No pity no nothing. I really don’t want sympathy pity any of that shit. Just feel, like damn oh well. Oh wtf I can’t do that for anyone. Ahhhhhh!!!!!! 

I really just want to die already but I can’t because people care about me and this is fucking bullshit. I quit my job and am almost out of money, I got Christmas gifts and have been spending time with them, but I just don’t want to anymore. 

I can’t just leave them. I can’t just die and I can’t just run away. I have to mold myself to be like all of you, and by all of you I mean you perfect fucks who do nothing wrong and have your whole life mapped out and everything goes your way, and that was bs what I said I’m obviously just exaggerating but I hope I got my point across. 

That’s really it huh, I just gotta learn to respect myself like I do others? Because I look at everyone and think they deserve the best and I bet nobody would cheat on them or ever think of leaving them and they’re probably perfect. 

But no, they just respect themselves. And they don’t take no shit. But I take all the shit. I’m so desperate for people that I let them do whatever. That’s so lame and not true but it is for those.

Fuck it,I’m over it. Decent journal post.

Ummm

TLDR I fucking hate myself and deserve nothing. Why am I sharing this with you? It would make me sad to know someone I care about is feeling like this, so I should stop. And that’s basically my life"

I don’t want company I don’t want to speak or be spoken to. I want to go there forever until I wither away to bones and dust. I want to rest now. I am so tired. My bones ache.

I miss the way he picked me up and spun me in a circle while I’m just throwing my head back in laughter. I miss our hand-holding and deep talks for all hours of the night. I miss our long walks. He’s so precious. It’s been such a long time since he broke up with me, 3 years, but I still think about him often. 

I would honestly give anything for him to just give me one last embrace while telling me how much he loves me. From the very first handshake we shared in meeting one another, I knew there was a connection. I felt it. I know he did too.. I think perhaps that’s what scared him away. 

We’re still friends to this day, although we don’t talk nearly as much as I’d like. He’ll never know my true feelings, at least not the ones I feel in this current moment. I’m sure in his mind he’s certain that I’ve moved on.. I haven’t. I still discreetly look for any replicated feelings for me, in his behavior. 

Whenever we hang out I search his eyes every chance I get, because who doesn’t love staring into beautiful blue eyes? But no, seriously.. Who knows when I’ll ever get to see them again. I know I have to let him go.. Hell, I even got him a mug for Christmas this year. 

He said he loved it and that he’d use it every time he decided to brew up a cup of coffee or tea. He has no idea how brightly I smiled at that.. I love making him happy. He feels like he doesn’t deserve presents but he does. I personally feel he deserves the whole damn world. 

Although.. He can’t know I feel this way. Not really. I’m not allowed to cross that line, and I don’t want to in case it’ll smack me dead in the face. He’s so hard to read.. 

But to be fair I’m an over thinker so it may not be as difficult as I portray it to be. I don’t know if this longing, aching feeling in my chest will ever go away.. I need him.. He can’t know it, but I need him so much. He’s the closest thing to love I’ve ever experienced. 

Everyone else in my life.. Lovers, parents, friends, family, ect.. have all betrayed or abused me somehow. He makes me feel ALIVE.. I’m so happy when near him. It’s a feeling like no other, his soul is like no other either. He’s just so imperfectly perfect.

I’m very thankful for him. I’m learning how to accept things as they are.. it’s painful though. All that matters, is that he’s happy. He’s distant, but still a text away. He’s slipping, but not gone. 

He’ll never read this so I must say.. I love you. I’m very much still in love with you and if our situation were different, I would show you JUST how much that is true. Thank you for beaming a light into my never ending darkness.. That light only lasted for so long but it is a feeling I will never forget. You gave me a gift, and that is the knowledge of love. I will hold onto that until my very last breath.. Despite the fact you may not be by my side when I get there"

I wonder what was so bad about being in that car, with that person, that made you choose to put your life at risk versus staying there any longer. The possibilities make my skin crawl.

I tried to follow as best as I could with 911 on the line, but once you were on the interstate the driver sped away. My car wasn’t fast enough to keep up. I’m sorry.

I hope the dispatcher simply forgot to follow up with me like they promised and someone caught up with you to check in. I hope it was nothing, a big misunderstanding, a prank gone wrong.

I’ve been living with depression for years, been on medication for 6 years and I love my meds. They give me enough clarity to recognise when I’m over reacting but still allow me feelings. 

I live with my father, I’ve moved out a couple times but I don’t do well with roommates because I have issues when it comes to how the house should be clean and kept and it’s not fair to others to have to deal with my anxiety when the house isn’t how I want it. I pay $50 a week, do a weekly shop of at least $100 and do cleaning. I also cook dinner but that’s because I love cooking and it’s very relaxing for me. 

I personally feel like I’m doing well, I know I need to do more and am planning on starting to walk in the mornings to loose weight. But every couple of weeks I like to just wallow. Sometimes I just want to sit out the back and have a few wines alone and listen to sad songs and just feel. Maybe I’ll have a cry about my past, maybe I’ll just listen to the lyrics and let my feelings free. I think I’m doing so well because I’ve stopped bottling everything up. Even if it’s not the best way to do it, I’m still proud of myself because I’m no longer cutting, starving or purging myself.

kmy1rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kmy1rw/opioids_stole_my_father/,Opioids Stole My Father,4,1,1609314952.0,"Growing up, my earliest memories are probably the best I have of what a happy family is supposed to be.  I grew up in a home where my father was a factory worker and my mother stayed home to raise my sister and I.  Up until about age eleven I had plenty of memories of large gatherings for most holidays. Grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, everyone just seemed to get along.  This might have been because I was an adolescent, but the world just seemed so big and happy.

I think it happened in 1990, I would have been 8 when my father got injured on the job.  He fell from a train car and broke several vertebrae in his lower back.  He was laid off in the coming months from a job he had worked at for over two decades.  Exactly how much this devastated him I will never know, but I do know he contemplated going into work with a gun to have a talk with the guy who fired him; fortunately it didn’t happen.  Shortly after, he underwent several surgeries to try to repair the damage.  Back surgery in the early 90’s wasn’t the greatest I’m guessing because nothing worked. They were super-invasive; literally flaying open his back and probably trying to fix it with tools from the Bronze Age.  It was at this point when doctors were probably at their wit’s end with my dad that they just started medicating him.  Vicodin, Percocet, Valium, and ultimately OxyContin when his tolerance was so high that those others were no longer effective.
In 1993, we moved a few hours away to start anew in a small coastal town.  My parents were competitive kite flyers and there is no place with better wind than the coast.  My sister and I spent many years being drug around to kite festivals up and down the coast.  It was a way for my parents, an alcoholic mother and an pill-popping father to surround themselves with people just like them.  My father was now a realtor and found decent success in that.  My parents drove nice cars, we lived in decent houses and always had food on the table, but when my parents had money they spent it.  Cars, motorcycles, fine furniture, materialistic bullshit to keep up the image.  When we moved to the coast we moved away from all of the relatives.  New memories with my extended family were few and far between until they eventually stopped altogether.

Years passed and things got worse with my fathers addiction.  I’m now in high school and my parents are constantly fighting.  My mother had to hide his pills from him because he could not manage them on his own.  If she only gave him what he was prescribed he would yell, scream, and belittle her for not giving him enough to deal with the pain.  If she gave him a few extra here and there he would yell, scream, and belittle her when he ran out at the end of the month.  She couldn’t win in this situation so she dealt with in her own way by drowning herself in Coors Light.  Through all this I felt like I was living two lives, one at home and one away.

In one life I was an average student who had a good circle of friends that shared common interests.  I had a good paying job for a high school student.  I had a car, I paid my own insurance, my own gas, and for all of my hobbies.  This precedent was instilled by my parents either because they wanted to spend their money themselves, or because they wanted me to be self-sufficient.  I believe it’s the latter, but whatever the reason, I’m thankful for those values.  Weekends were spent mostly at other people’s houses, gaming, playing paintball, or partying.  Fortunately I never drank and drove, and was always in a safe place; two things my mother told me not if I drink, but when I drink.  I think I had my first beer when I was 13 or 14.

My other life was at home.  To paint a clearer picture, It’s worth mentioning that I found my passion for computers in 1995, when I was in 7th grade.  I see now that it was a coping mechanism, but they gave me something to master as I sat alone in my room, trying to escape the screaming from the other side of the door.  I knew that computers were going to be important in the future and because of that, never saw them as a waste of time; they were my ticket out.  As time passed things progressively got worse and I could no longer hide from what was happening.  My father had become suicidal on several occasions and two memories stick out in my mind.  The first was coming home with my mom to him sitting on a chair outside on the deck with a loaded M1 Garand rifle sitting next to him.  Without hesitation I grabbed it and unloaded it; he muttered something to me in a drug-induced stupor but I don’t remember what it was.  The other was coming home to him sitting in our recliner with his wrists cut, bleeding all over the floor.  The ambulance was called and he was driven away to the hospital.  I can still see it making its way down our long driveway, lights flashing.  There were several other things that went on under that roof but honestly, they’re so repressed I can’t remember all of the details.  Lots of fighting, accusations of infidelity, my father calling me a social disaster because I spent all of my time in my room, the list goes on and on.  But through all of this, it never became physically violent between my parents, so there’s that I guess.  It was around this time I realized there was little my parents could offer me, beyond a roof over my head.  I had to grow up, fast, and I did.

My sister dealt with it all in her own way.  She was rarely ever home because things were so bad and she had a car to escape.  When she did come home my father would often come unhinged at her for being gone too much or that she was out too late.  One time he even pulled the wires on the distributor of her car so she couldn’t leave.  She filled her time in high school with partying, boys, and very little actual school work; she would ultimately not graduate because of it.

Once I graduated, I left home as quickly as possible.  College was never a priority in our family but I moved alongside of my friends who did attend college.  From a town of 9000 to a town of 100000 was quite a culture shock but I loved it.  I kept working for the same company as I did in high school (in a different office), and worked my way up as fast as possible.  After a few years I got a position within their small IT department which forced me to move a few hours away.  My sister got married out of high school and had her first child, she has since had 3 girls whom I love dearly.  While it was easy to put all of that trauma behind us in the short term, it would continue to rear its ugly head time and time again over the years.  My parents moved away from the coast and stayed married until 2007 when my mom would file for divorce, she had just had enough of my fathers addiction/emotional abuse.

After the divorce, my father would pack up and travel around the country for a while in a van.  After years of being on his own, he settled on living in Kansas City where my sister lived at the time so that he could be closer to his granddaughters.  It didn’t take long for the real reason to come out; to manipulate my sister into dealing with all of the shit that my mother had given up on.  The pill hiding, the threats of suicide, and all the guilt that he put her through, he preyed on my sister’s big heart because he knew he could.  While I was thousands of miles away from it, I could see that it was destroying her life but felt so helpless.  The final straw was in 2015 when she called me in a panic saying that Dad is at the police station and that he may have shot a little girl.  I was on a plane the next day to Kansas City where I could team up with my sister and make sense of what had happened.  At the psychiatric facility that he was transferred to we asked him what happened (after being assured by the police that no one was hurt).  He had a long story about how seven people broke into his apartment and were going to kill him to use his place to make meth.  He then barricaded himself inside his closet and fired off nine shots into the bottom of the door.  Thankfully he lived on the ground floor and the bullets went into the ground.  The toxicology report came back and showed nothing in his system and to this day we don’t know for sure what happened.  I think that he was severely dehydrated and probably hallucinated vividly enough to shoot at people that weren’t there.  We sent him to rehab where he stayed for about a week where he went through withdraws from the Oxy.  I can’t say for sure, but I don’t think he has gone back on them but I know he still takes other painkillers.

During all of this my sister was going through her own divorce and planned on moving back to Oregon.  As soon as my father caught wind of this, he was all-in to move back as well since there would be no one in Kansas City to care for him; a few years later that’s exactly what happened.  I flew out to help my sister pack up her place in a U-Haul and head back west with my father in tow.  When we got to his place it was an absolute shit-hole, It hit me hard seeing the state that my father now lived in.  Absolutely nothing had been packed despite knowing he was moving for months and I could see the hurt in my sister’s eyes.  It didn’t matter too much since most of his stuff was just trash.   All the the furniture was so badly stained and just reeked of cigarettes, there was no way we were hauling it across the country.  My sister and I cleaned out his apartment the best we could, boxed up the few things he wanted to keep, trashed the rest and hit the road.  He never bothered to sell his car (or get a KC license/register the car) so we just left it there in the parking lot for whoever came for it.  I gave so few fucks at this point, I was there to support my sister not deal with his bullshit.  We set out in the morning and never looked back.

Since being back, I really don’t have hope of building any kind of meaningful relationship with him.  He has burned so many bridges and taken advantage of so many people it’s disgusting.  A couple of years ago he got into a relationship with someone from his high school.  I met her eventually and she’s an absolute delight; such a nice lady.  This obviously raises red flags for me since I know my father and his tendency to exploit the weak.  Today, they’re living in an RV together, and when I saw her on Thanksgiving she just looked tired.  I know through my sister that she hides his pills, and I can only imagine what else my father is putting her through.

Am I the asshole son who doesn’t care about his father?  I wish I could see what the outcome would have been if he didn’t fall off that train.  A big thing that infuriates me is that he has NEVER, to ANYONE apologized for ANYTHING that he has done, or put people through.  He has put both my mother, sister, and now girlfriend through hell and he 100% acts like nothing ever happened.  With decades of drug abuse, does he even remember most of his life?  It’s something I think about.

If you’re still here listening to me rant, thank you!  

I have never spoken about any of this to really anyone outside of my family, maybe a few close friends.  One of my goals in 2021 is to go to therapy and just talk to someone about this and a few other things.  I recognize that there is a lot of stuff that I have kept inside and locked away because that’s the easy thing to do.  Just writing this post has brought up some things that I have totally forgotten about.  My sister is struggling right now pretty badly in her life and I know she looks up to me.  I’m hoping that once she sees me follow through with it, she’ll go see someone as well to battle her own demons."

I had a horrible experience with one of these people. Although they never officially took an IQ test, I think they are pretty smart. Of course, I am aware of the fact that people who are more intelligent tend to be rational, and usually do not concern themselves with emotional stuff (or so I hear). That is probably the reason they were so mean to me. It is not however, only the fact that they said something horrible to me, that irks me. It is also the fact that I am extremely jealous of them, and jealous of all their miseries too.

For a long time, I used to think I was quite intelligent as well, but I am not. Indeed, I hate hating them so much, because it is not their fault and they were simply too intelligent for me. Who was it who spent their days in high school, looking for a friend who's 'intelligent enough' ? It was me, and now I'm quite disappointed that I wished so.

I do not know whether all intelligent people are like this. I've only ever talked to one. It is extremely nerve wracking to see one whom you held in high regard, say something so demeaning to you. And I don't know, despite being a dumbass myself, I have had pretty much the same experiences as these 'intelligent people' and yet I am forgiving them for their shortcomings simply because they have a high IQ, (whatever the fuck that means), while I cannot forgive myself for the same shortcomings.

It is because of them, that I have started instinctively hating all 'high IQ' people."

It started off as just a casual online friendship and then we got close and eventually met in person a few times. After that, we both fell in love with each other but didn’t pursue anything because we both agreed it would be awkward if we ever broke up.

Now she has a crush on another close friend of hers and seems to be distancing away from me (probably because I can get jealous sometimes that they talk the way she used to talk to me). Everything I do seems to pull her further away from me. She told me the other day she didn’t want to be friends anymore because she was tired of arguing about the same things (I’ve been getting mad lately that she’ll flirt with this person in the same group chat as me knowing the way I feel). I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

I’m trying to pretend I’m over it and not let the flirting bother me, but it’s *right in front of me* and sometimes it feels intentional."

I notice that no one will talk to me unless I talk to them. I’m not sure if this is how things should be or not. Either way this is how I made this situation for myself, somewhere in me I’m aware that it’s left me feeling sad but I try to ignore it. In all honesty it would be nice to have someone to talk to, I’m a naturally extroverted person, although my 2 friends weren’t really there to listen to me very often anyways."

My brother has been sliding into a deep depression over the past couple of years. My family doesn’t help him get help, and just get angry at his behavior. My mom worked late on Christmas night, and hurried home to be with us. My brother and I are grown and I am married. I drove an hour to spend time with folks, so when my mom showed up a little late I was happy to see her. Since she was a little late, my brother got so mad he stormed out of Christmas and didn’t come back. I have texted him 3 times since then asking if he’s ok, and that I love him and there was no response. 
Tonight, the night before I am going to see my best friends I haven’t seen in over a year he sends a text telling me he was exposed to a friend of his who tested positive. On Christmas Eve. 
It really pisses me off, because on one hand I want to be supportive of my brother and the journey he’s on, and on the other I want to lash out for his irresponsibility. He lives with an elderly family member and may have put them at risk as well.

I love her a lot, I do find her pretty attractive and theres really nothing wrong with her. The issue I'm having is that I have an incredible amount of lust for other women, and it really makes me miss being single. Every hour of every day I'm thinking about random women and fantasizing about how I would flirt or make a move if I was single. Yesterday I hung out with an old friend of mine from highschool, and she is so sexy all I wanted to do was get in her pants. She took me to her house to grab a charger and I didn't go inside because my girlfriend doesn't approve of me going in her house but is okay with us hanging out, and the whole time I was just thinking that if I went inside with her how easy it would have been to get her in bed. I've never crossed the line and cheated but God it is always in the back of my mind. I have 2-3 girls that I know that if I asked them out on a date they would probably say yes. One of them is an onlyfans girl and my lust is so bad that I actually bought a subscription for it and jerk off to it whenever I don't get to fuck my girlfriend.


I know it all sounds horrible and you're probably telling yourself that I'm a horrible boyfriend and that I should go ahead and break up with her. But that's really the one and only issue that I have with the relationship. I love her a lot and I know she loves me even more, I know if she knew what goes on in my brain it would break her heart, but breaking up with her would probably destroy her even worse, the last thing I want to do is hurt her. I almost broke up with her for this exact same reason about a year ago and I couldn't go through with it because it was all too much. Seeing her cry was horrible. We have a bright future ahead of us and it would truly be sad for me to throw it all away to get that missing feeling I want. But then again what if I stay with her and we end up seperating regardless, I'd be kicking myself everyday for not breaking up with her when I was in my ""prime"". I don't know, it's just a back and forth of thoughts that I've dealt with everyday, and I will never be able to truly reach an answer on my own."

So first off please excuse me for two things... 
First English is not my first language so excuse me for any typo or nonsensical structure of sentences... 
Second this is my first post on Reddit and well im kinda lost/unexperienced on this. 
And third it’s really late here and I haven’t slept so if there is any mistake that I didn’t correct well sorry... 

Ok so im not sure were to begin... So this year about 3 months ago (on September) i met a girl on Pornhub (i know being myself a 17m and having an account on Pornhub is pretty much ilegal but oh well... ) and obviously here is were it all begins... so this girl who i will be referring as Mo (not saying her full name for privacy reasons...) was posting a lot of really depressing posts on pornhub and her Bio well... it pretty much said all about her she felt empty every day, she wanted sexual attention solely because it made her feel her “worth” and because for a few moments she could be “happy”and also that dhe wanted to kill herself and someone to help her do it... after seeing all of that and some of her photos... (on which she was nude...) i just saw she had a lot of cuts and other marks on her body (of previous cuts) on her arms ,legs... after i saw that (and the fact that nobody said a thing about her cuts or bio and just said lewd stuff...) i decided to send her a message (since she had added me as a friend) i pretty much told her that killing herself and hurting herself would change nothing and that eventually everything would start being better (i know... empty words...) and that she should have hope and also told her that if she wanted to talk she could talk to me snd i would try my best to help her whoever i could... (im also aware that saying all of that wouldn’t really help... but at the time i knew nothing of her...) 

After a few hours Mo answered me: “Thank you for caring so much i read all of your messages quietly” she said. I told her not to thank me (since what i did wasn’t anything worth thanking...) and we started to talk i remember she also told me that i was a sensitive person (and she was/is right) she asked me about my life and if i had s normal one (i told her some personal stuff I didn’t mind a lot saying) but after that she told md she would answer later because she couldn’t focus which I thought was kinda weird but i told her it was fine... but a few days passed and nothing so i talked to her again to check if she was alright and she told me she was “ok but not ok” and also told me “thank you sweetie” (which made me so fucking happy... i love when people tell me cute stuff like that...) but still it fell kinda out of place the sweetie like idk...

After some time she posted again some really depressing posts saying how much she wanted to kill herself and how much she hated BPD (which at the time I didn’t know what it was) and again i tried to help her after discovering what horrible mental disorder BPD is. telling her to please not even dare to try to hurt herself and that I wouldn’t leave her and that if she needed anything to just tell me. She told me that she didn’t have courage to kill herself (for the time being....) but that she preferred to live as a “****” so she could feel her worth since at least men liked something from her... (reading that really fucked me inside but it was just the tip of the iceberg...) she also said that she feared like me to eventually be alone and that she realized that men only wanted to use her body not caring about her... using her like a fucking toy but again it was the only thing that made her “happy”... she told me more stuff as well but i don’t want to say every detail im sorry. 

About her life... She had a partner which whom she was married to but because she cheated on him unintentionally/intentionally (BPD to blame there im certain of that) this partner after knowing that mistreated her I don’t know the extent of what he did but nothing good... (i mean i can “”kinda”” understand him for getting mad... but yet i just feel it’s not fair...) she also told me that at the age of 10 she liked to read or hear about child abuse (warning sign...) she started cutting herself on elementary and was also “hurt so much at school” I don’t know exactly what happened to her but i guess the worst... her parents loved her but again just like me she felt that parents love is not enough. She also doesn’t understand what love is or how to feel it (i tried to explain it to her but i obviously failed you can’t explain love... you must feel it and as someone who hasn’t received much well...) besides all of that she told me that the thing that made her the happiest was when being physically controlled and hurt she preferred that above everything and that “she would feel the happiest when she was dying” because nobody would love a “****”. I told her that someone would love her and that hopefully someone would help her and take care of her... and also told her (even though i was on a long distance relationship at the time) that i would love her if it wasn’t for the fact that i had a girlfriend... (I didn’t want to commit past mistakes again...) 

Anyways... more time passes... since she was on pornhub she uploaded from time to time nude photos and videos... which my lewd self obviously saw... i swear i cried every fucking time i saw her touching herself because she was full of cuts... and also that sometimes she would end up crying after finishing... it was traumatizing... but the worst is yet to come... 

Mo and i talked a lot... she was my friend or at least i believe that... she told me that i was the only person to whom she had told so much about herself and also the only one that cared so much for her... she told me her age 25 and so much more... in some ways i connected with her so much... both because i really wanted to see her happy snd because we kinda shared some aspects... (but I restrained myself from doing anything stupid... as i said I didn’t want to commit any past mistakes...) the thing is sometimes Mo would be so caring towards me and talk to me so much others... just silence... and after some time i kinda became paranoid that maybe she hated me (because BPD could make her be like that...) but she didn’t... still she wouldn’t talk to me as much... which made me sad... and worried because her suicidal posts continued... until one day she told me she had found someone... (someone who would not only use her as a sexual toy but worse...) 

I hate remembering what i saw... Mo published two videos one being 30s the other barely 20 she was on a Room, loud music playing (i guess maybe a hotel room or apartment...) on the first video (the one with barely 20s of duration) she was being fucked by someone... and some small recent bruises where visible also Mo was well... idk if moaning or screaming i just don’t want to fucking think of it... the second was awfull I can’t fucking erase those images of my mind... Mo body was just fucking... Fucking covered on bruises and more bruises and blood and it was just so painful and awful it was fucking horrible and this “monster” was fingering her ass... and again those noises... seeing that i just freaked out and send her a lot of messages a lot... the only thing dhe told me was “im ok i just want to be like that” after that she didn’t answer to me... for a long time... 

Until Pornhub recently erased all videos and pics of all profiles not associated with them (something which im glad of... to preven cases like this...) Mo then told me about it... angrily... and after i asked her what she would do she just said... “i leave”... and she did she erased her account and so did i... 

To be honest... i miss her... and im really worried about her... her plan is to be used until she is 30 after that she will either kill herself or find someone who both uses her and kills her... i do not know where she is besides her original nationality... but she moved from her home country so... i really don’t know how to feel... it’s just depressing i want her to live and be happy she deserves it and that someone anyone cares for her and doesn’t take advantage of her... but is it morally right... during the months i tried to help Mo I didn’t know and to this day I don’t know if ANY of what i did is right or wrong... i was trying to remove the only thing that made her “happy” but it’s not right to be used like that... there are so many other alternatives... i just don’t know shit... im tired of writing and crying..."

Also no I do not have open containers full of food out nor dishes in the sink or anything of that nature. Do y’all think I could negotiate my rent to be Reduced or do I not have a chance in hell?

Today I was driving a route that I knew well, but for whatever reason I didn't realize that I was one lane over from where I needed to be to turn off a highway. At the last minute I realized it, and waited for cars already in the lane to go by with my signal on, but when there was a gap big enough for me to squeeze into (or so I thought) I ended up causing the car(s) coming up to slow down really hard and honk at me a bunch. I didn't cause an accident or anything like that, but the oncoming drivers seemed pretty darn mad (and that's totally justified, definitely my fault).

I consider myself a fairly good driver, and this kind of thing (getting honked at / messing up / making others uncomfortable on the road) has only happened once or twice to me, but whenever it does I feel awful about it for several days and it takes me weeks to feel even semi-confident driving again. Is that normal? Am I weird for being so scared to drive again over something that didn't cause any tangible problems? I just spend so much time freaking out about how the people on the road probably decided I was a bad person based on one honest mistake. 

Thank you for reading."

This is my attempt to reach you. As you know Im not the perfect catholic but I know you and me are in good terms. Once in a while I pray, I do good, love with all my heart and give my best for my little family. 

So you already know, because you know it all, that my husband, my baby and I got the virus. Just when I thought yesterday,after receiving the positive results from my husband and me, was one of my the worst days in my life, fate decided it would not be so. Because today my beautiful six month old baby got a fever. Everyone had told us to be chill, “Babies don’t get the virus” they said. Well they do. And I feel like shit and Im not going to lie and blame you over this and scream to the sky about how unfair you are. This is all on me. 
I shouldn’t have gone to my in laws on Christmas Eve. I shouldn’t have done that knowing that my mother in law felt kinda weird one day prior but was totally sure it was because of her allergies. 

But Im stupid and naive and arrogant. Because we all think “That shit about Covid is not gonna happen to me, it sure as hell happens to my neighbor and to thousands of people on the planet but not me. Because Im stupid and arrogant and beyond the laws of God.”  

So the point of all of this is to, first of all: say thank you. Thank you for my beautiful family, my hardworking husband, my perfect smiling baby, thank you for everything you have given us 

Second of all, and of course, I came to ask. To ask you to please have mercy on me and my family. Specially my baby. I love him with every piece of my old soul. Please make things easy on him, I swear I’ll do everything in my hands to make him better but I know I need your help. 
Also I would like to ask you a final thing: strength. Give me strength to do everything I need to do to keep my family alright. I know Im also sick but I need to be at my 100%. So strength is what I ask for. 

Thank you again for everything you have given me and forgive me if I have been distant. I know you might listen to this a lot, but I promise it will never happen again.  You never believe until you need to believe.

Personal life: I’m in my 30s and still single. Been trying too but the dating circuit is just filled with hopeless f___s, people who play games, and no one who’s interested in the future. I see friends and family younger than me getting married, some as quickly as 3 months, but even finding someone for a relationship these days is impossible.

Work life: hate my f-ing job too. Been working for over 5 years and still not a single promotion! My boss loves the work I do but I can’t play politics for shit and that’s all that seems to matter in life more than education or work ethic. I feel overlooked and undervalued and if I slack off, they’ll use that as a reason not to promote  me. Leaving for another job is VERY difficult given the nature of my job. For everything you need connections, networking but people don’t respond to random people looking to “network.”

Personal-at-work: coworkers have been gossiping about me and talking shit since I’ve been there a long time but since no movement, they know my manager doesn’t like me. So if they have issues or are mad, they make things up about me and tell the manager who blames me. If I bring up an issue, I have interpersonal problems. If others bring an issue about me, I’m a problem. I’m supposed to accept how people treat me even if it crosses HR lines. I just can’t f-ing win!

NOTE: the environment I am in is union backed so many things go on in the background that result in the above problems.

With all that’s going on (the above just grazes the surface), I just feel like I’m slowly deteriorating inside. I’ve been having thoughts of killing myself and how that would look like. How I’d set it up, what I’d do, who I’d talk to before I do the deed... I know I won’t actually do it cuz I’m scared but it’s comforting to think about how I’d execute it. I want the people who pushed me into this corner to have blood on their hands, to KNOW they did this!

Anyways needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading."

Again..,3,2,1609307274.0,"I never technically cheated. More of considered it. Started moving in that direction then changing my mind. Lying about small things when she tells me literally everything. Weve been together for a good 2 years. Ive told her my darkest secrets. Ive cried in her lap. About 3 months into the relationship I broke up with her and was drinking and ended up at an ex's house where we ended up without clothes. She came over the next day to try to talk through the breakup and I told her what happened. She cried and we ended up together again that week. With my ex she had told me about a girl i should pursue. A mutual friend who id only met a hand full of times. That conversation stuck in my head while i continued my relationship with her and she had told me she did not want me to contact the ex or the friend. I didnt for a good year. But it ate at me. I felt like i had unfinished business or something. Maybe i thought I had hopped on the wrong train (sometimes we werent very happy) idrk my motives it was kindof impulsive and irrational to be honest. She had texted me asking why I removed her from social media. So i messaged her secrety. And kindof explained why I lost touch with her and at the same time kindof talked shit on my gf for being insecure and stuff. She found the messages. It hurt her feelings. I did it secretly. I hid it from her because i was unsure of my feelings and my intentions. I wanted to keep what I had and see what else the world had to offer. Selfish..i didn't contact her again. Recently another ex has gotten in touch with me. A girl I spent one summer with who I was very much in love with. I was 17 at the time. We went to festivals and did lots of acid and it was all very magical. I found her on instagram. I enjoyed looking at pictures of her. It was nice to remember. Also shes very pretty. She messaged me. And asked how I had been. I had a short exchange of messages telling her I am happy and that my life is going well. She asked to see me sometime and i said perhaps when the weather is warmer. Fully aware that this was inappropriate and would he crossing boundaries that had been established in my current relationship. I deleted the messages. My gf found that she was following me and was very upset that i had searched her photos. I explained that i felt it was innocent to look at photos and that I didnt really have any other intentions with her. She got over this for a week or so after I told her that I just wouldnt look at her pictures aymore if this was indeed the line i shouldnt cross. So that was peaceful for a minute. Then after a week or so she made a comment about her being out of my league and how thats probably why she left me (I believe that was a defense against her insecurities and probably a way to make her feel better and really also a joke) This offended me. I mean i had a good time with this person one summer five years ago. Fond memories. I looked up her photos again that night sortof absent mindedly. She found somehow in the search history. I had deleted it but she knows more about how to navigate the apps. She asked me about it and if I had messaged her so i fessed up about her coming to me and the conversation that ensued. It really hurt her. Saying she cant trust me. That she hates that she loves me. That I'm not honest. That she obviously isnt enough for me. And I can't rekindle the situation. We were in such good standings hours before this. We went to the store to pick up vitamins with our dog and we were happy and in tune. And now I feel the wall building. The distance between us. How she'll never get over it. It'll always be in her head. After the first incident she gets sooooo paranoid about me even seeing regular guy friends. Thinks I'm gonna find a way to cheat on her. And now I'm stuck. With this shitty situation. And theres no way to remedy it. Shes always going to distrust me. And our lives are so very intertwined. Our survival kindof depends on each other. I havr no family to go back to. Her options suck too. Neither of us are financially well enough to consider leaving. I could honestly afford it ig but itd fuck her and her brother who stays with us. I feel like when she got iver past things it scarred the relationship. And any time it got slightly better I did something else that scarred it more. I care about this girl. I mean shes honestly the centerpiece in my life. And largely the reason for my aspirations. She helped me through a shit load of heavy life things. First place with her and everything. Sorry for misspellings and the long unorganized story. I dont know what to do from here. I kindof feel like things are just gonna be shitty between us and im gonna be stuck apologizing trying to win her trust for the rest or the time im with her. Its shitty. And scary. And I feel trapped, indebted, and regretful. I dont know what to do. I dont know how to fix it. Or if it can be fixed"

Most of my friends are happy to meet up a few times a year.

My long term friend, who I've known since grade 3, doesn't even really refer to me as her best friend anymore. This is the friend I am concerned about, let's call her K.

K hardly ever replies to my texts, I have to text several times to get a reply\*. When we do agree to meet up, we're not even really doing what friends do: we're doing a ""catch-up"" thing, where we just go over what's happened in each others' lives, rather than have a real rapport. I want to be able to laugh and just talk, not run a verbal FAQ session. We do talk and have flow, but it just feels rigid.

We also 90% of the time do the same thing when we meet: go to a burger place and walk around the shopping center then go home. I have asked her if she'd like to go to a fancy hotel on the coast (my 30th is coming up) and since we NEVER do anything fun anymore, figured it'd be nice. But it was a hard no, as it was too expensive and she doesn't like busy beaches. That is fair, but it's something we'd only do once, and since we never do anything anyway, figured the $ would be a drop in the ocean. You only live once / turn 30 once, right?

I have brought this up with her, that we only ever do the same thing, and she said it was an unfair thing to say. Because she's so busy. I feel like she spends more time with her church and that group and related activities that I am nothing. I am not religious, so don't share this. She works in retail, so yes she can be tired a lot.

She is a contributing factor to how I feel: no one ever reaches out to me, I never get to have friend time - I am lonely. She noticed this last night and said I should see a doctor for medication - I don't think she realises that how she behaves is a contributing factor, and that I just want a friend to talk to, not a doctor. I realize I shouldn't rely on one friend to make me feel happy, and I don't, but everyone treats me the same way. I feel this is all feeding back into the loop, and affecting the amount of time people want to spend with me: I am losing social skills and feeling worthless.

\*She does bring up what I write about in the texts, so she's reading them. But I feel distant from her. We don't really have much in common. I recently got into an Engineering degree and would love to talk about that and careers. All I ever talk about with her is dating (she was recently divorced).

I've also had a lot of difficulty driving for about 3 years, not once has she ever offered to drive around the block with me (as in, I can no longer drive the anxiety is that bad). Not that I expect that, but the lack of support is saddening.

Anyway, I sound like I leach off people, but I wish I had better rapport and support from my friends."

About an hour ago I was in the kitchen cleaning up from dinner. Nothing special, just take-out. As I was wiping down the counter with a sponge, something compelled me to clean off the KitchenAid mixer that always sits in the corner. It hasn't been used in a few days so it wasn't dirty, but I found myself wiping it down with the sponge. I grabbed a clean cloth and started to dry it off when I though I heard someone singing.

It was really faint at first but I would swear up and down that I heard it. The only thing playing in the house was Modern Marvels on the History channel that my partner was dozing off to. I kept drying off the mixer and the voice was slightly clearer, it sounded like my Nana singing How Great Thou Art...

A little back-story:
First, some of my earliest memories are of me with my Nana in her kitchen. Her house was always warm and welcoming, stocked with jars of Oreos and Cameos and her oak candy bowl filled literally to the brim with M&Ms (a 38oz Party Size bag). Many times when out with my parents, if we were in the area, we would just stop by and visit. Nana was usually sitting in her chair doing crosswords, knitting, or watching television. We would chat and have tea or something. Nana would also babysit me when my parents were away or busy.

And this is where we come to the significance of the KitchenAid. It was *her* KitchenAid, the same machine she and I used countless times to make cookies, cakes, her signature Pimento Cheese, or whipped cream for topping hot chocolate in the winter. She insisted I take it when she had to move to a retirement facility in 2012. Ever since then, I use it **all** the time, so every batch of cookies is still made with a little bit of her love from that machine.

Second, I am not at all a religious person, since coming out and everything else that has gone on in my life, I do not associate with any religion or anything like that. And I have not been to a church service in I don't know how long. The last time was probably her funeral in 2016, so I am really struggling to think of a time where I would have heard her sing that particular song.

But, I'm almost positive it was her. And it made me feel some kind of way. Like that choked up feeling you get when watching those Military reunion videos.

I still can't explain it or maybe it *was* just some faint memory.

I love you Nana, we miss you so much. I hope something in this, or another universe, lets me see you again.

Tiny backstory: we have moved to two different states and lived in about eight places during our five years of relationship and have constantly minimized. However you know how family sometimes can be and he comes from a big one so they give us a lot of hand-me-downs and his mom also has a shopping addiction so we receive a lot of new items. I donate to women shelters and thrift stores about four times a year because the items I feel that we have could be better used by somebody less fortunate. This is also because I was that person once...i am an adopted child from Flint, Mi. 

I'm really struggling right now because my significant other is at work and he's always let the decorating part of us living together be up to me (while obviously changing things after the fact which in the end usually works out in both of our favors). However, I'm taking down some of my pictures and a lot of the artwork and decorations that I got when I was single (during my an 8 month breakup period), but he's used to them being a part of our home together.

I feel like with the chaos of this year I want a lot of the clutter that we have from the accumulation just to be gone because our mind spaces will be cleaner with less items around that we don't need. I don't know the best way to explain to him why I'm trying to decrease the clutter.

Sorry for the book but does anybody have any kind of advice for how to explain where I'm coming from?"

I was on chemo for 3.5 years and it wrecked my shit. I’m generally unwell as a baseline, have a few lasting health conditions, 3 super formative years were occupied by trying to not die (or trying to die, depending on the day and how shitty of a time I was having), and I left pretty bitter about having drawn that straw. I wished sometimes that it had happened to someone else and not me. 

Looking back, I think that was an understandable reaction from a child. I’m not that angry about not being the healthiest anymore. We all have our issues. 

The shitty thing is, I get some weird internal rage when people romanticize cancer as a “battle” and talk about how people with cancer are so positive all the time and always are ready to “fight” or “beat” their disease. It makes me cringe and I hate it. I think those are stupid words to describe anything like what I did. I cried every day. I hated my life. I wanted to die. I wished for someone else to take my place, in the moment. I was overdosed on chemo and had absolutely no autonomy. I was ashamed of my body, and how it betrayed me. 

Maybe I’m bitter that I wasn’t the superstar cancer warrior but I cannot stand it. Having known those who didn’t get to ever “be done,” it also feels like a slap in the face to them and their families. Did they not fight hard enough? Did they not want to live badly enough? Were they too pessimistic? No. I think not. 

I do feel like a huge asshole for wanting other people to stop saying things like that. I understand that they want to support those in need of support. It just doesn’t land right in my brain.

Let me fully explain

I'm in college this year, I have to repeat a year because of some issues from last year. Near the end of last year I just kind of broke a little. I cant do college. It's not the work, it's just socialising I think. I just cant do it. 

I just want to drop out and do my own thing. I want to get a job, but my inability to talk to people is going to make that impossible. I havent really left my house in months since college is just online anyway. Even if I managed to find a job and went outside it wouldnt make a difference. I'd just completely break down and cry before I went to work, and during my break. It would be too much.

I dont know what's wrong with me, I just cant do anything on my own. Hell, I stopped taking my anti anxiety medication months ago because it didnt even work (been on it since February, stopped taking it around September all of a sudden with no side effects because it didnt help). 

I dont need to worry about student loans or college, it gets paid for here by the government, and student loans aren't serious in this country. I'm just so upset and stressed about not being able to just be normal. 

I dont know what to do about it now. I dont know if I can tell my parents, I dont know what to say. I just know If i wanr a semi normal life i need to find out what's wrong with me, and get it fixed as soon as I can.

This post is kind of a mess, but it's the best way i can put out my thoughts. I hope this makes sense"

So for the past mont or so me and me friend (I’m gonna start calling her D) was planning to visit each other the last day of 2020 as a celebration for our friendship.
My parents are pretty strict and if you want something you gotta ask for it here, and so naturally I asked my mother if I could go and she told me she’ll think about it, every now and then I would add details to her such as “D is going to give me a present, I want to get her a present too” or “her mother wants answer ASAP”
But as always I got the same answer, “I’ll think about it”.
Last week I really tried my best to convince her to let me go, but I think you already know what her answer is.
The thing is, D is my neighbor, she lives a few houses away and it’s a 2 minute walk, I even showed my mother her house to let her know how close it is, D’s mom even called my mother to try and convince her since she knows that my mother is strict, but that was a temporary fix.
Yesterday day D told me her mother is annoyed that we didn’t give her answers yet and told me to try my best today to get something out of her, and so I did exactly that
I tried to plan it perfectly, why D is a good friend, why is it safe, when should I go and come back, crocodile tears and etc...
I asked my sister to help me just in case it didn’t work and she was down for it so the show began, at first I came up to her and told her I wanna talk, she first tried to show me something about her game and some other stuff and I tried to brush it off and head to the talk, at thins point my sister came and pretended to do something but my mother took her attention to her and started talking about something ( I wasn’t focused I just wanna say my thing) after 5 minutes of waiting my mom finally turns to me and asks me what’s up, so I told her, everything I could I told her, but as always, “I’ll ask dad when he comes home” (btw my father travels every week to do his job and he comes every weekend) but he usually comes at Thursday late at night and that’s the day I wanna be in D’s house, I got a little annoyed and upset that she keeps laughing everything I say off and never take me seriously so I told her if my sister was in my place would you let her go? And guess what she said “no, I wouldn’t.” I’m gonna clarify that I’m soon gonna turn 17 and my sister is in her early-20’s
I kept trying to go back to the topic as she kept getting distracted by my sister talking about unrelated things, and when I tried to say something she cut me off and told me no.
I got upset and ran to my room while my sister and mother were laughing at me and telling me to come back sarcastically (at least form what I could tell)
I cried my ass off and it only got worse so I messaged my mom and spammed her with “I hate you” and “you don’t allow me to do anything”, “I lost many potential friendships because you didn’t care!”, “why don’t you try and put yourself In my place??” “I hope you take me seriously one day.” And all of these stuff.
I called D and cried with her because she also wanted me to come, we planned so much things to do together.
When I woke up this morning my mother came up to me and told me that we can go but only if D’s mother is at home (D’s gonna be home alone so that’s not a possibility) and if so the she’s gonna come to me.
Ngl I felt really bad, I wanted to say sorry right there and then but the words never came out of my mouth. I’m planning to apologize soon but for now, am I the asshole here?
Also advice accepted

Sorry this is long and my English is kinda broken. But I hope I got my story clear.
Thank you."

I expect a full mental breakdown when we’re released and back to work.,5,1,1609303915.0,"I thrived in the COVID world.   I have a great career and absolutely love my job. I love what I do, and am 20 years into it.  However, I have a career history in chemical and biological warfare and defense.  I get super anxious around anything that could expose me or my kids, and that’s my personal PTSD to deal with.  Until now, it was gradual.  Have PTSD, work through it.  Kid one:  do it again.  Kid two:  start to accept a baseline fear and panic as normal.  COVID gave me the closest I’ve come to freedom from that part of my life as I’ve ever experienced.

During Covid?  We all have masks.  We stay home. We’re the safest we’ve ever been and I got to see every single tulip bloom this past spring.

When I go back to work, that PTSD that has been quieter with restrictions is going to flare up again.  But more than that and in addition to the constant fear and anxiety, I’ll be doing a 45 minute commute, a 9 hour workday, and another 45 minute commute.  My dog will need a stranger to walk him at lunchtime, and I’ll miss out on the best parts of my kids because I drop them off when it’s still dark and don’t get to pick them up until they’re overtired and done being good for the day.  I’m their rock to crash on, and that’s ok as their mom.  But damnit these months of sharing daily joys, watching them learn, and being a part of any part of their day has grounded me.

When I go back to work, I don’t expect to rejoice. I won’t be returning to normal.  I’ll be sinking into a flaming shithole where I feel like I’m missing out on my life.  This life.  This closed off neighborly communal thing that COVID became. I’ll truly mourn this time.  I’ll be back to daily fear of exposure or malicious intent.  I’ll look for enemies everywhere knowing that I can’t protect my kids from what I can’t see.  That mask?  It did more for me than anything ever had.  It gave me peace.  And it’s about to be ripped away so we can go back to normal.

PS:  I have a therapist.  We work on all of this.  She knows I’m doing better locked up and is trying to work me through it.  I’m safe, and my kids are safe.  But I will never ‘thrive’ in my return to what used to be normal."

kmuw8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kmuw8c/a_prayer_for_my_uncle/,A prayer for my uncle.,2,0,1609302252.0,"Apologies for the way I word? I dunno. This is one of my first longer posts and I don’t think my wording will be very good? So I apologize in advance.

I’ve only talked to three people about this: another uncle and my mother (introduced me to this info & who I overheard) and my friend (felt I needed to tell). I don’t know all of the information and I believe a lot will be held back from me. I’ll try my best

4 years ago, I met my uncle who I’ll call Steve. Steve came to my county and it seemed like he was here for a visit. Almost my whole family lives here, including Steve’s mom (my grandma) and his daughter. Upon the first week he was here, I overheard a conversation between my mom and him. I wasn’t paying too much attention because I was watching TV, but one word I remember was “addiction”. I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time, I just assumed he meant he was addicted to cigarettes. Now this visit turned into a month, and then into 3 years. I didn’t know until now, that he would be considered a “moocher” ( I could be wrong with the word? Feel free to correct, I might just be making it up).

Steve lived in my grandma’s house for about a year and a half, and then moved into his daughter’s for the remainder of the time. Steve didn’t have a job for the first year, I believe, and found work at a hotel. He had a car that was in real bad shape which broke down in about year, so he ended up taking my grandma’s car which also broke down a couple months later resulting in my Grandmother purchasing a new car, which Steve took advantage of. I’m unsure of why Steve moved from my grandmother’s to his daughter’s. Steve’s daughter was married at the time of Steve moving in. Steve’s Daughter’s husband didn’t like him, so at the end of his stay he moved down to a new location with his son. During his stay at both houses, he was helpful: fixing windows & building new things, but I was oblivious to how Steve took advantage of them. Making them buy him groceries and laundering money.

So fast forward to two weeks ago. My mother comes into my room and reports that Steve has gone missing. I didn’t know how to react. Someone who’s been apart of my life for a while just vanishes. I went through the whole day just questioning how I felt, and I felt bad about it. Mid-day, I’m tagged in a Facebook post about how Steve’s been missing for 5 days and to spread awareness about it. At this point, I felt a tightness in my body (like the ones I get when getting yelled at or when I’m about to cry). I was super stressed. 

Fast forward to the next day, I’m working on emails when my mom gets a call. Another family member is crying about how he’d been found and how of a bad condition he was in (yellow skin, failed liver?). My other uncle comes to my house to join in on the call and give advice, to which my family members didn’t follow. To get out of any talk about the situation, I went to bed early but I was called down about 30 minutes later. My mother and uncle know I was listening in and they tell me about Steve’s meth problem. At this point, the “addiction” comes to mind. He struggled with it before moving to my town and had found access to it in his new location. He had 3 phones and we assumed he had problems with not paying up for a last purchase. 

At this point, I haven’t been told much more. I just want to get this load off of my back. I’ve left out a lot of information, but I feel like it wasn’t important (I could be wrong of course). I’m taking this as a lesson as to never use drugs and not take advantage of people. I don’t want to rely on someone for everything just to give back little in return. Of course I’d love help, but I can push myself into succeeding. As with any sort of drug & even alcohol, stay away. Don’t get involved. Not only are you bringing yourself to rock bottom, but your family and friends.

If you read this, thank you. And, if your religious, please keep my uncle in your prayers. My whole family would appreciate it. Please don’t look anything up, I don’t want anyone to be found or contacted (I don’t know if anything else is online about it)."

Well I let him know I wanted to be a little more serious and that I would wait until he's ready, but he said he wasn't ready for a relationship and he saw me as a forever friend. 2 weeks later he tells me he wants to move forward with the other guy he was seeing because ""it felt different"". I accepted and some therapy and antidepressants later we are such good friends, although I have a hard time not showing that I'm in love with him. 

Well he wants to spend new years with both me and his partner, so I invited them over. We are going to have drinks and food. It's going to kill me inside, but seeing him happy will be worth it.  He's my best friend first and foremost. Plus I have to accept sometime sooner or later that he may be my soulmate, but that doesn't mean I am his.

This led to me seeing other guys she is talking to on her google hangouts which are scamming her for large sums of money. This led to me finding the biggest and most gut wrenching scam. I eventually looked through and signed up for a credit karma for her and saw that she took out a loan of over $150k from her house that she bought and was giving money to a fake person. Little by little giving money to him and for other causes sure but she wasn't this broke to where she had to do this for the other payments. 



And this is the saddest part. I found out and told my older brother and thought we could get to the bottom of this and help her. Instead she has gone crazy and is spouting about how it's on her now she's going to deal with it herself and if you want to help then help. We suggested options such as selling the house because she has no income at all and is completely broke and we would help pay off the loan all together. Her ""support group"" is giving her bullshit about how everything is fine and we don't understand and she's going to pay off the loan of $150k+ with 4% interest by herself and it's going to be ok. 


This is the gist of us trying but basically summarizes how I have never been this disappointed in someone before. I don't know what to do. I love my mom dearly but she doesn't want us to help in a way that for sees a future. With her logic she's going to pay this loan till the day she dies and I don't know how to feel.

I have always prided myself on being a good friend and have had long lasting, strong friendships as a 24 year old that have lasted a lifetime. I am from the south in a small town so we have known each other our entire lives.
 
Two weeks ago I messed up, not too bad but bad enough I didn’t speak to several of my friends for a few days, but I was forgiven for it. That being said, I feel as if I’m drifting away from some of the guys. One of the guys who I was and have been consistently close with is very volatile. I have heard him bash and essentially dislike every single one of my best friends to me over the course of a decade, and I am sure I was the topic of discussion with other friends, he gets annoyed easily. Yesterday he got really mad at me for something super minor, and I feel uncomfortable around people who should be my best friends.

What is alarming is my friend groups pattern of exclusion. We have cut some guys out, and while I have stayed close individually with all of them, they no longer hang out with my other friends. I have always worried I was next up on the chopping block and I don’t want to lose these people. I know it sounds like they’re a bunch of shitheads for this, they’re not, but one or two of the guys exclude others and the other dudes don’t care enough to do anything about it. They have been a key part of my life, all my life. I feel vulnerable and insecure with these friends right now, it is affecting my confidence, self-esteem and general mood. 

I just don’t know what to do, and I can’t even go to my friends about it. I’m scared and any advice would be awesome."

I have a plan since I was 16 that was at 18 run away, but here in my country is difficult, as may be in most countries for sure. Now at 20 I have the chance of selling all the furniture I can (not much) and run away or stay and listen to these calls every once in a while.

This falls more into the long-standing baggage category because I feel very guilty about scamming people into paying tens of thousands of dollars for college or grad school. 

I've worked in admissions (undergraduate and graduate) admissions for nearly 10 years and need to get some things out into the world:

* A whole lot of graduate programs are a scam. I currently work in graduate admissions. So many master's programs are created for the university to make money, not to give you a good education. If you are looking for a master's program that isn't required for licensure or certification in your field, please, please be very wary. This includes MBAs that you are self-funding. Things to consider:
   * Licensing or certification exam pass rates. If they aren't willing to give you this information, it usually means the rates aren't impressive enough to share. 
   * Alumni outcomes. What are people who graduated with this degree doing? Whose career has directly benefitted from the program? Many places don't track this directly but you should still ask to gauge what the university's responses are.
   * Course syllabi from the most recent semester. Don't just look a the course listing and course descriptions. Ask for the syllabi so you can see exactly what you'll be doing. If they give the excuse that it's private info, tell them to remove any private info (e.g. instructor's contact info). 
   * Ask to sit in on a class. 
   * Ask how many students they enroll each year and how many of those students graduate. Consider it a red flag if the number of students enrolled seems too small or too big. Also ask how many years the program has been running. Look deeper into new programs to look for the scammy ones.
   * Look at the methodology of the US News rankings before deciding how much to trust them. The ""peer assessment"" is US News sending university dean's a list of other schools. The deans rank each other on a scale of 1-5. That is sometimes 100% of the ranking methodology...meaning sometimes 100% of the ranking methodology is based on people's perception of how good the school is, not actually how good it is.
   * Who teaches in the program? Depending on the field of study, adjuncts aren't a bad thing. But I currently work with some programs that rely 100% on adjunct instructors and they simply have no accountability to the program. Most professors have little or no training on how to be a good teacher. Adjuncts actually have zero training. 
   * If you can learn the same stuff from free courses or inexpensive certificate programs or bootcamps, ask admissions why you should pay them for the full degree. If they tell you it's about networking, then ask for specific examples of how their network is worth the additional thousands of dollars and exactly what they do to facilitate networking that you can't do on your own. If their answers aren't satisfying, it's not you -- the answers probably won't be satisfying.  
   * Try not to pay for grad school -- work for the university and get tuition remission; find an employer who offers tuition remission; go to a program that offers you the most money.
* Financial aid is a negotiation. Any funding that comes from the university can be adjusted. There is more wiggle room for place that use the phrase ""merit-based aid"" compared to ""need-based."" Merit-based means ""we'll tell you this is based on your grades but it's really based on how much we think it'll take to get you to enroll."" The federal or state grants can't be negotiated. If the school is offering you money, ask for more. Tell them that another school has offered you $XXk more and see what they counter with. 
* Look at how the university gets its money. If most or all of its revenue comes from tuition, that means they make all their money off of you, and that they'll try to get as much money out of you as possible. The higher ed crisis is coming for those tuition-driven universities. Over the next decade, expect to start seeing more of them close, merge with each other, or get absorbed by larger universities. 
   * This is hugely important. But also a tricky thing. Yes, I know you want to go away and have the college experience. But is graduating with huge loans worth it? On the other hand, we know there are real benefits of getting out of your hometown bubble, expanding your mind, etc. etc. That is real. You do you. But buyer beware.  
* If you are enrolled in an undergraduate program, take organic chemistry at a community college online. Or any other course known to be difficult. Before you take it, get approval from your registrar's office that the credits will transfer in. Why pay a huge 
* High school students -- seriously look into CLEP exams. Just check with your university first that they'll take CLEP credits. AP/IB students...if your university takes CLEP credits, weigh which test is easier and how much they cost. Go with whichever is easier and cheaper. 
* You know the joke online about people having an existential crises and then going to grad school. DEAR LORD TAKE UP MEDITATION, GO ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS, GET A FISH. DON'T GO TO GRAD SCHOOL.
* This all said. There are legitimately good universities and good programs. I do believe in higher education as a concept. But also believe that contemporary higher education is broken and preys on people who don't know better. 

Thank you. Good night."

I don’t go there a whole lot, but when I do, it’s usually to buy junk food. Unfortunately, it’s in a really shit neighborhood. There is a train station less than 200 feet away, which is thriving with homeless and drug addicts.

I’ve seen both of them hanging out in front of the bodega. Usually, it’s either some guys smoking or a dirty man begging on the sidewalk. Aside from a few altercations and even a man stealing a woman’s jacket off her back, nothing really happens there.

As I was leaving, a man goes up to me saying “I haven’t eaten anything in 3 fucking days! I’m starving! I only have 5 dollars. Is there anything you can give me? Even the tiniest bit will help.”

Of course, I assumed he was homeless and gave him $10. I just felt sorry for him. Even though he was wearing a mask, I could tell he had a big smile on his face. He said “Thank you very much.” and shook my hand.(I scrubbed them til they were raw once I returned home.). At first, I was very proud. Then, I remembered that he could’ve used that to buy drugs or alcohol.

There still is a chance that he really was going to use it to buy food, but I’m not sure about that. The fact that I may have helped someone fuel their addiction(It was only $10, but still!) haunts me. Either way, I have no plans to return to the part of town."

I’ve had clients die of it. I haven’t seen friends or family in months, except face time. No family meetings for thanksgiving, or Christmas, and planning for none over the new year. 

It’s hard, but I know my work is important. I work with people severely mentally ill, many of whom are on the brink of being hospitalized. With so many places closed, I know my interactions with them are more important now than ever. I see relapses and hsoutlaizions on the rise for my people, so I need to be there now more than ever. I have clients who can’t go a week or two without meeting with me, or the auditory hallucinations and self injurious beavhior gets lethal. 

And I go home after a long day and see social media and friends and family and so many people not wearing masks or social distancing. Over Christmas, so many people traveled and went home to see family. Sometimes, when I wish them safe travels, I ask why they are doing this during a pandemic. 

“It’s for my mental health” is the answer so often. 

I’ve heard it so much I’m getting offended. My clients with severe mental health struggles, individuals with schizophrenia who have hallucinations of voices telling them to kill themselves, need interactions. You, an extrovert who likes people, does not. Them not interacting with others causes a suicide attempt, yours causes you to be down. 

And I know I’m being unempaghetic, and I know I’m not being nice. I know everyone has mental health needs and this pandemic has been hard on us all.

But I haven’t seen my family in months. I throw myself into work with overtime supporting people, because NA and AA and hospitals are closed. I quarantine when I get exposed (which is often) and this year has been hard. But your choice to go to a bar or get your nails done because you “need” interactions for your mental health, is damaging me. Why do you deserve to see your family and friends, but I don’t? Why do so few of us take this pandemic seriously and have to be the adults where we do all we can, just so you can spend time with your friends? How dare you say you need this for your mental health. My clients need it, you don’t. 

So yeah, not nice, but I needed to say it. People are being selfish. Your hanging out with others is cruel. So happy New Years to me, alone. Because of your actions"

I have been a lurker for some time, but thought it's time to post my own ""family drama"" story for your wonderful advice as I would really appreciate an outside perspective. 

Over 6 years ago, my dad called me and said a young man reached out to him and thought he may be his son. My dad was in his mid 40s at the time, and potential half brother was in his mid 20s. My dad also has alcohol abuse problems, so I keep my contact with him limited as interacting with him is often stressful. When I found out this news, it came up in conversation a few times, but wasn't something we were comfortable talking about and faded away once my dad started having health problems. 

I wasn't even 18 at the time, and honestly mortified that something like this could happen. I thought that if I looked into this and verified it was true, everyone would judge me and my family. I have only told my mom about this when it first happened, and haven't ever mentioned it to anyone else, even my boyfriend of 4 years. Potential half brother and his wife both added me on Facebook when this originally occurred, and then again 1 year later. I never accepted the requests, and have not been contacted by them since. There are no messages that took place between myself and potential half brother, but my dad met him in person and ""took his cigarette"" (for DNA analysis? No idea what they were thinking.) 

I know this was probably a selfish thing to do, but I just didn't have the emotional maturity when this surfaced to handle it at 17 years old. At this point, years have gone by. Although I have some awesome and loving relatives, my dad has a lot of problems and potential half brother may be disappointed in how our dad is an alcoholic. So much time has passed, I am not even sure if potential half brother would still want to talk. This has definitely been on my mind the last year or so, and I have been building up the courage to possibly add him on Facebook. 

This was not my fault or the fault of potential half brother, so I can't have hard feelings and also should understand his perspective. 

Reddit, if you were in my shoes, would you reach out to half brother and his wife? They seem like a great family based on their Facebook photos, but what could I run into opening up this can of worms? I grew up an only child, so a sibling could be a great blessing, but I can't shake what my boyfriend and friends might think about this secret, and why it has been hidden for so long. 

Would I ask them to meet up or take a 23 & Me test to see if we match as siblings in the database?

&#x200B;

Thank you all for reading! :) 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Found out I have a potential half brother, haven't told anyone in 6 years, and looking for advice on whether to reach out to him."

My first semester of Freshman year, I would be loud and drunkenly obnoxious(thinking that I was being funny). Because I kept things to myself in High School I thought I would change so I tended to overshare A LOT. 

After going home for the holidays, I realized how obnoxious I was being and changed and have definitely grown into a more mature person.

Our friendship is falling, along with your relationship with your mother. You have become extremely rebellious, but demanding your mom house you, feed you, and pay for your college. Your mother has confided to me that you never listen to her, but you say you do. I know you don't because you don't listen to me. You have broken rules your mom set up, and then get upset that you get punished for it We both understand you're an adult and in college, but you expect your mom to bring everything to you on a silver platter. I think she is handling the situation pretty damn well considering how much of a douche you have been to her.

I know that your mom isn't perfect and has many flaws, but you have been kicked out of her home 3 times the past 4 months, and each time you throw a fit saying It wasn't your fault. Each time you have sald it was because your mom is controlling, but we both know that she wouldn't take any action with you unless it was necessary. I'm surprised your mom will probably still let you back in the house because you sure as hell wouldn't be allowed in my house If you treated me the way you treated her.

At this point, you are either choosing your bf or your mom. I know that you want both, but there is no going back once you choose.

Sincerely,
Someone who isn't sure they want to be friends with you anymore"

This post is me finally venting my existential crisis and overall my fears that I don't want to burden anyone else with. Ever since I was young, I was always afraid of death once I learned that it happens to everyone, and I even went to therapy for it. I talked to a professional about my fears and in one of the sessions I blatantly told him ""i don't want to die,"" and unfortunately I don't even remember how the rest of that conversation went. The entirety of it all must have helped though, since for a long time I hadn't thought about it for a while and I guess I was happy with my school life. But recently it has hit me again in full blast and I have no idea why. My brain feels like it's attacking me, not allowing me to do simple things without being so negative and so grim and just overall scary. I feel like for the past couple of weeks I have done nothing but realize that everyone I love will pass away, including myself, and the world will just continue on. I don't think I'm prepared for all the heartache in this lifetime that I have yet to experience, and I don't know if I can handle it. I keep sitting here making myself scared that there's nothing I can do so stop these things from motion, that since the day I was born my days on Earth are limited. There will come a time where I'll pass and I'm even more scared of what that is. God writing this is making my heart beat so fast but I just want someone to talk to about this. It genuinely feels like nothing matters and that everything I do is for nothing. My time is limited and that's it. I'm only 21 but it feels like tomorrow my life will be over, and I don't know why. I try to distract myself with things I enjoy doing but the minute I give myself a second to think to myself I just go back to being depressed and scared. This isn't normal, right? I don't remember what it was like to not think about this stuff 2 weeks ago but I wish I was blissfully unaware like how most people seem to be. Is this a result of being cooped up during covid and giving myself too much time to think? Is there any way I can come to terms with these fears? There's so much more yet I feel like I don't need force myself to think too hard again about this stuff, and I really don't want to bring others down with my existentialism. I'm not optimistic in thinking I can be talked about of these thoughts, but I'm so tired of being scared and alone with my thoughts.

TL;DR I'm having an existential crisis and I'm afraid of death, and these thoughts have been plaguing my mind for the past 2 weeks. I can't seem to stop thinking that nothing matters."

So, I’ll do the best I can and hope that you all can follow along, haha. My main purpose of telling this story is to see if there is anyone out there who has run into the same problem. If so, advice on how to fix my situation would be greatly appreciated! 

Being a 12 year old male, I knew that my voice would change during puberty. I was so ready for it, to say the least. I couldn’t wait for the voice cracks to stop or for people to quit thinking I was one of my sisters when I would answer the family phone. 7th grade was rough, haha. But my mom would always tell me, “It’ll change one day!” 

The only thing is, that day still hasn’t come. Or at least, to my immediate family it hasn’t. 

Let me explain-

Going into the 8th grade, I had enough of the voice cracks. I had enough of being soft spoken. I was just tired of waiting for this “voice change” to happen. So, I found a way to make my voice significantly lower than my normal voice. Like I’m saying, OCTAVES lower. When I started 8th grade, I decided I would simply use my “man voice” at school and my “normal voice” at home. What my family didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them right? That was my idea at least until my voice would eventually change permanently. 

My voice was like a light switch and with it came two different versions of myself. 

My “normal” voice that my family knows (still to this day) has my personality being soft spoken, shy, and distant. I hardly every want to talk around my family because I hate the prepubescent sound my voice makes. If we go out as a family, I grasp every opportunity not to speak. Which makes me socially awkward and off putting. 

My “man” voice that everyone else besides my immediate family knows has my personality being loud, confident, and the life of the party. I’m the type of person to start up a conversation with a stranger. I speak at events in front of hundreds of people. I’m spontaneous and easy going and I actually enjoy my life. 

After being caught up in this double life for the past 13 years, I’ve found myself not being able to enjoy the time with my family because I’m always worried that I’ll see someone outside of my immediate family and risk being caught in my double life. It causes so much stress because I feel like I’m constantly having to change the role I’m casted in. My family knows me as a quiet, insecure being while everyone else in the world knows me as the complete opposite. I mean, my life shouldn’t be this difficult to live, but that’s what I’ve created and now I feel stuck. 

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t really know which voice is real and which is fake. Obviously at the beginning, my deeper voice was just a show until my voice permanently changed. But after using the deeper voice for so long now, I’m wondering if I’m forcing myself to use the prepubescent voice when I’m around my family. In other words, has my voice actually changed but I’m now trying to fake my 12 year old voice around my family? It’s so confusing and complicated, lol. 

I’ve never told either side about the other and frankly, I don’t know if I ever will. I’ve dragged it on for 13 years so it feels pretty impossible to go back now. How do I even go about explaining the fact that after my 7th grade year, all my friends stopped coming over to my house? How I’ve never been able to keep a romantic relationship? How I never answer phone calls? How I freeze up when a person from one side of my life meets the other? I wish the friends I’ve made over the last 13 years could meet my family. I want to get married and have kids. I want to be able to enjoy my life as one person instead of two. 

I wish I could just be, me."

5. We all need a vent every now and then - any parents that need to vent about their situation please feel free to PM me your story.  This shit sucks - this whole thing sucks.  Especially if your in a similar situation as myself and don’t have a good place to vent to, I welcome you to.  It helps tremendously to get it off your chest!

Those of you without kids or a stay at home parent at home, you’re killing it to - just need to give a special shout out us who are balancing young children, jobs, absurdly awful politicians, and keeping our shit together on the outside.  2021 is our year, you can do it!"

My mom had an accident years ago. The accident caused multiple things but one of them is that she only has one eye now. The other eye is fake. I was showing my mom a video of a young girl who also had a fake eye and how she takes it out. My daughter always wants to see every video or pic I show someone. I usually show her but this time she kept bothering to see it and I had already put my phone away. But she got annoying so I showed her and she got super scared. Initially her reaction wasn’t what I was expecting. I figured she’d analyze the video to understand what was going on and ask questions like usual. But she got scared. (At the same time she saw the video my mother was taking her eye out to show someone). she saw both things happening at the same time. I then thought yes getting scared seems within reason now but I’d still expect her to be more interested rather than frightened. But after a few minutes she’s still scared. As she comes to my bed a while later she seems to think we all take our eyes out like that. It took a while to calm her down but I still haven’t told her yet that it’s only her grandma. She was crying so bad her eyes were puffy and her nose and lips a little puffy too from crying. I think I just gave her a traumatic moment she will probably remember forever. She might have nightmares about it soon she might be terrified of her grandma now or of anyone. She’ll be too scared to see a new video or too scared to play games like “I got your nose!” I’m scared I just messed her up. She’s 3 years old and has a great relationship with grandma

But I am so tired of seeing the way family's treat each other, deal with conflict In a way that is strictly to comfort themselves and not actually solving any problems.

Yelling doesn't solve problems, swearing or being rude doesn't solve problems, and putting the other person down doesnt solve issues. (And yet most people do this without even meaning too, because it makes US feel better)

Negative reinforcement has countless studies proving that it is a inferior parenting/teaching method, not to mention, we wouldn't have to deal with anymore of those ""well I was hit as a kid and I'm fine"" dipshits.

That is literally a form of the abuse, you've been brainwashed into thinking hitting a child was ok, because your ""abuser"" exposed you to it, making you desensitized to the idea of it. Like it or not, that is reality.

And much like someone who has been sexually abused as a child is more likely to become an offender themself, statistically speaking, same goes for victims of child (nonsexual) abuse.

BECAUSE the way we process the world at that point in our lives generally dictates how we see the world and how it functions for the rest of our lives.

I was hit too, regularly until I was 14 and actually outgrew my father. I was sexually abused as well for a short stint by a (distant) family member, I Have yet to tell any of my family members about it, specifically because of their inability to deal with conflict in a way that I know will be effective. Because they deal with it in the exact way that society has taught them, and everyone else it seems.

When my parents would use the belt as a punishment; It didn't feel good and it didnt actually teach me anything, (other than what a belt feels like) 


it just made me scared to be honest with my parents. And scared of the idea of fucking up or making people mad. 

Negative reinforcement creates anxiety ridden, poorly functioning adults.

And by poorly functioning I mean; do you need a beer/wine/smoke/joint after work more than 3 days out of the week? That NEED/cravings/ addiction can be severely aggravated by undealt with stress or anxiety. (I'm aware this is pretty common knowledge so I'm sorry if this is coming off preachy)

I personally smoke a lot of weed, I'd say I'm the closest thing to addicted to weed that you can get.

Heavy smokers/drinkers can usually connect their addiction back to some form of mental illnesses, whether it be anxiety or something else. A big one is stress.

Humans have pretty stressful lives overall, teaching your child to be able to sit down, and control their emotions and put it into words is something that should be practiced every day of your life, not just when you're young. 

I started practicing this a few months ago, whenever I feel the need to raise my voice, i take a deep breath, and rather than just spewing whatever comes to mind first, i attempt to de escalate by making sure I have a calm voice, not letting my *ego* take over, and listening to what they have to say.

If they so choose to keep screaming, I maintain my calm voice. I've noticed that even if the person keeps screaming for the first little bit they eventually realize that I'm not attacking them, their beliefs, etc. And tone down.

If they don't, then the biggest part of what I've been practicing is walking away, if someone is being non productive in a situation, leave and come back to deal with it later, no one is rational when they are just trying to get a point across, which is generally (at least in my experience) the reason we start to escalate things without even trying.

Anywho, this is just something that I've been practicing as of late that has made my life (as a person with severe anxiety in social situations) a shit ton more pleasant.

Dont be your Ego, be yourself instead."

My step mom just ignores me, i wish everyone did.

I had to quit college due to a crisis i had, boys are so mean in college, i don't even want to talk about it.
I feel like my girlfriend will leave me even thought everything is perfect between us, i keep telling myself that it's just my bpd acting out.
My dad plain hates me, he allows my brother to be violent too and i can't do anything.

He is always making jokes about food and cuts just to trigger me and it works. My step sister does too and i don't know if i even did anything, no one will tell me.
I can't write in my diary since they read it, i don't have anything. I don't have anything safe.
I feel like a failure. I want to go back home with my mom and my girlfriend and my friends. 
My mom is so mad at my dad, everything must be so tense. My step sister is the only one that has reached out, i had to block my brother.

I don't even have a proper room, they forgot about my birthday (i'm my brother's twin! How do you forget?) i didn't even had a Christmas present while they each got a car.
I have my own car and my own apartment in another city but was it so hard to get me a Christmas card?

I feel rejected and embarrassed. No matter what i do, they hate me. Mom didn't want me to come and she was right.
They make fun of me for my bpd, for skipping meals or not being able to keep them down when i don't even want this. They make fun of my scars. I should have stayed home, i don't know why i tried. They were better without me.

I bet everyone else would be too, i'm only useful to dissapoint people.

I hate being alone when i'm sick and now i'm at the hospital, away from home and alone. I know that everyone is mad, either at me or the situation.

Everyone thinks that my life is so perfect with all the clothes and make up and cute pics i get payed for posting but it's tiring to fake all the time, specially when i hate myself and everyone else does too. I'm tired."

I’ve (22F) been with my partner (22M) for over 5 years now. This issue has been ongoing, and as much as we try to ignore it, it just keeps getting worse and worse. 

In every single aspect of our lives, we are never the ones they compliment or approve of in any sense of the word, because there’s always someone doing something better. Usually one of their children (4 total, incl my partner) or their nieces or nephews, who are all around the age of 15-25.

I’ll only highlight a couple of things.

*The Anniversary Mishap*

One of their other sons (We’ll call him Peter) had began dating this girl who lives 18 hours away (we’ll
call her Lucy). We saw this girl maybe once, but we didn’t hear a ton about her either. They happen to have the exact same anniversary as us, only 4 years later. My partner mentions to his family that “July 8” is coming up, to which they replied with glee “oh right! Peter and Lucy’s anniversary!”. Completely forgetting the fact that we have celebrated this day for the past 4 years together. They broke up a month later. 

*The “Enjoy your 20s” Aggression*

A few months ago, my partner and I began talking about our future together, marriage, kids, etc while at the in-laws (keep in mind we very much like to keep our goals and our life private, but were asked about what we wanted to do now that we were close to being out of university). We mentioned we’d like to get married in the next few years (2-3), and children may be in the cards within the next 5. This was immediately interrupted by the in-laws who said “no, just enjoy your 20s. You need to be ready when you have kids.” This quickly shifted the conversation to Peter and Lucy, to which they said “maybe within the next 5 years Peter and Lucy will though. I can see them being ready.” (Peter and Lucy would be our current age in 5 years). This felt like a kick in the stomach. I felt like they were saying we were not ready, when in reality, we had been living together on our own for 3 years at this point. This was just before Peter and Lucy broke up.

*The Trauma Competition*

A few weeks ago, their other son (we will call him Devon) started dating a girl we will call Sheila. Apparently Sheila has a past filled with a multitude of trauma due to her parents’ divorce. For some context, it should be said that I was ripped from my home at 13 to live hours away from my tiny little hometown to continue past middle school education. I stayed in homes that were arranged by a board, which paid for my ability to stay there. You can imagine all of these people were in it for the money, and I was heavily abused, starved, and isolated daily. Some of these people were my family members, which I have the unfortunate obligation to retain a relationship with to appease my family’s need for “keeping peace”. But this is a different story. Anyway, I struggled with this for a long time. It’s only been 4 years since I left this part of my life behind, but it has taken me a disgusting amount of time to recognize it as traumatic, and to accept it. I could not talk to my own family about it, because much of the abuse came from my own blood family. So, I turned to my in-laws, who I was convinced were caring and empathetic people. Whenever I try to vent, explain, or seek comfort from them, I’m told to go look for a therapist, which I cannot do as I don’t currently have insurance. But Sheila’s story of her parents divorce, they sat and listened to diligently, as retold by their son (Sheila’s boyfriend), Devon. They sat there, for an hour, saying how “incredibly strong” they thought she was, and how this changed their perspective of her. (Please note, I am NOT one to compare traumas and this is not what I am going for. I have a medical background and I am a huge advocate for trauma being individual to the person who experienced it). But to me, I was told to seek therapy, and the subject was changed, every time. 

*The Engagement Race*

And now, my partner’s cousin just got engaged. We have been together for 5 years, and we got engaged in July, on our anniversary. We decided that we wanted our wedding to be 2 years from now because we wanted to be the only people to pay anything towards it, which takes time and lots of budgeting. This cousin, (Jenna) got engaged after less than a year together, are in their teen years, and refuse to work because “they don’t have to” and because they are still only in 2nd year of their 4 year-degrees. They decided to get married in 6 months. Why is no one mad that their teenage children are getting married? I wanted to be married the second my partner got down on one knee too, but it’s not doable, it’s not practical. We try to be responsible and wait. Everyone is noticeably more excited for them. My partner busted his butt to get me a beautiful ring, so much so that he had to wait an extra year to propose because he could not afford it at the time. But, they’re all much happier for them. We are waiting 2 years so that we can have a beautiful wedding and we can give everyone in our families a beautiful day to celebrate with us. Part of me feels like this has to do with me and my partner having lived together unmarried for 4 years now, so us getting engaged and married wasn’t and will not be as special. It wasn’t a rush and it was not for the purpose of being able to “correctly” live together. We want to get married because we want to. We know we live together before marriage and that his family may tend to look down on us for it. But it hurts. 

We work so hard for everything we have. His sister is almost 30 and has never made an insurance payment, rental payment, car payment, or even paid her own gas. I bought my first brand new car at 17, I worked my way through university by working at night in retirement homes. His brother brags about failing his exams. I graduate and receive my license to work but it doesn’t matter because they’re more excited Devon is now going to church again. We get the opportunity do research for our university, but it doesn’t matter because their daughter painted a nice picture last night. 

Whenever we say or announce anything, someone is always doing something better.

They never ask how we’re doing, they just talk about how amazing their other children/in-laws are. 


I’ve always felt we were nothing to them."

I have three housemates but it feels like I live completely alone.

All of my housemates spend their *entire* time in their rooms except to make and eat food. I understand that a lot of people live this way, but my family growing up wasn’t like that - we spent our time in common areas all doing our own things. If anyone was “hiding in their room” it was usually an indication that something was wrong. 

A few weeks back I got into an argument with a housemate & in it they said that I had “taken over the living room” by spending so much time in there, which resulted in me trying to spend more time in my room - but hanging out in there makes me feel crappy, time moves super weird, & I end up unable to sleep at night. I hate it, bedrooms are for sleeping or when you want to be completely alone. I’ve tried encouraging my housemates to spend time outside their rooms, but nothing has changed.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m an introvert through and through. But I miss the comfort of having people in the same room as me. I miss hearing someone sitting next to me chuckle at their phone. I miss hearing turning pages and laptop typing. I hate that I’m so aware of when the heat turns on & off and that I have no one but my dog to say goodbye to when I leave the house. It feels like I’m suffocating in silence and loneliness, and calling family/friends actually makes me feel worse once we hang up. 

The year before last was my first year working from home, and I was living with a few random housemates (also bedroom livers). My mental health dropped drastically, and didn’t come back up until I moved (mid contract because I hated it so much) - then I was lucky enough to live for a year with my best friend who would play video games & hang out in the living room. I’ve only been in this house since August & I’m already starting to drown. I guess I need to figure out how to Craigslist for housemates who like spending time outside their rooms.

Even though I wouldn’t want to live with my family again, spending a week with them made my current living situation all the more poignant. It seems like such a silly thing to be so bothered by and I don’t understand why it matters so much to me, but I needed to get it off my chest. The cry while typing this helped.

Many sectors of the economy are getting hit and regular working class folks are having to cut corners, which includes cooking your own food.",7,0,1609291935.0,"If you decided to go into the restaurant business, then guess what? You took a big fucking financial risk. Pandemic or no pandemic, most eateries don’t make it more than three years. Many are mismanaged, several others treat their employees like slaves, and very few pay their employees a living wage.

Restaurants that are successful year after year have some of the highest profit margins known to businesses of any kind in addition to being traditionally recession-proof. I worked in the service industry for 10+ years as a cook, expeditor, and barback and I can tell you that most restaurant owners never had a problem laughing all the way to the bank while other industries struggled during bad economic times.

Also, there are far too many unqualified, entitled jack-offs working in service positions for no other reason than they can’t hack being employed anywhere else, especially if they have to submit to a drug test or are expected to show up for their shift on time. Too many of them spend their whole shift shit-talking about the customers who pay their rent while bragging about how little they care about doing their job well. This garbage work attitude occurs more often than people realize and in my opinion shouldn’t be rewarded with my hard-earned money.

Yes, it absolutely sucks that service workers who give a shit and do their job well are out of work right now. It also sucks that many other small businesses, big factories, and various other industries have to shut down for weeks at a time after a few employees test positive for COVID. But you know what? There are so many people and businesses struggling right now who wouldn’t dare guilt-trip their customer base like so many restaurant owners are right now.

I can’t even count how many sad-sack, poor-me, “order takeout and tip generously because COVID” posts I see every single fucking day from restaurant owners on social media. These are same entitled, talentless fucks who pay their servers shit, overwork their cooks, and price-gouge their customers while posting pics to Instagram of their latest overseas vacation or new sports car. Obviously this isn’t EVERY restaurant owner but it’s really fuckin sad how common this behavior is.

All I’m saying is this...fuck you if you own a restaurant and are upset because more people are cooking their own food because times are tough. You’re not the only one suffering and learning to cook for yourself is actually a great fuckin skill to learn. So if you’re trying some new recipes and ordering less takeout, well good for you! Don’t let the shitty restaurants in your town make you feel bad because you’re not buying dinner from them every night or even every week. Buy a cookbook and learn to make something delicious. Support your own financial security and develop some culinary skills instead of getting overcharged for shitty service and sub-par food. And if there is a great restaurant in your area that you love, by all means keep supporting them and don’t feel like this vitriolic diatribe is directed at hard-working service workers who love their craft.

And quit whining because things suck right now. Life is hard for everyone. Go have a good cry, rub one out, and quit trying to make people feel sorry for you on social media. It’s 2020, you fucks. Be glad you made it this far."

I don't *really* understand what was so wrong about talking the way we did. I mean, I guess I sorta do, but I also don't.  Idk. Maybe that just makes me an asshole.  

I don't *really* understand why you held back so much, when I poured my heart out to you again and again and again.  

So, I guess what that leaves me with is a lot of things to explain to myself and loose ends to tie off. And in the absence of you, my brain says:

*He never loved you; he couldn't have. People like him don't love people like you.*

and 

*He never trusted you enough, otherwise he would've opened up more.*

and 

*He is never going to talk to you again, he just needed a gentle way out because you made him uncomfortable and he was too nice to tell you.*

And I just need you to know that no, I don't **actually** expect you to talk to me again. 

But it sure would be nice if you did, anyway. 

I don't **actually** expect you to try to be with me, ever. 

But it sure would be nice if I heard from you again, eventually. I have so many questions still, somehow.

I know that I will only get answers if you decide to break the silence, and although I wonder what you're thinking every day, I love and respect you enough to do what I promised you I would do: let you go. 

But it's so, so hard to miss you. The more time passes, the more I question what was real. 

I wanted so badly to be loved, that I'm afraid I imagined everything. And then I ruined it all, I guess...

Writing you here is the only thing that helps, marginally, because I know it's safe. But my heart aches for you, and it probably always will. I'm so tired and so sad. I hope you are happy, though, and free. I hope you're loved. 

I love you to the end of everything."

Last year I was laid off and got a new job right away, which was so great.

Right before I started my new job, I finally had enough of a shitty marriage and moved out of my house, away from my husband and kids. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment down the street. I see them almost every day, the kids stay over often, but I live by myself now. Not officially separated, not seeing other people, but doing marriage counseling and living apart.

I haven't met my new coworkers in person, and I haven't had any real conversations with my new neighbors due to covid.

Last year the only friend who would text me to hang out moved away and now I don't really have anyone in the neighborhood to hang out with. I was part of a couple of book clubs that have met a couple of times virtually. I had just made roller derby before the shutdown and attended one practice and that ended too..

When I lost my job I had to stop going to my therapist because of insurance changes.

I texted my old coworkers a few times but it never came to anything.

I guess this is all to say I am feeling very lonesome. It feels like my life disappeared. Everything ended last year for me and nothing has really started again. Nobody checks in on me--I check in on other people and then the thread dies.

I tried facebook, but had to delete my account last year because current events were making me very upset and prone to oversharing.

I haven't really told anyone I moved out, so I'm kind of invisible right now. They all think I'm at home, busy with kids and marriage and mowing the lawn. I should feel free but I just feel like I'm in suspended animation and nobody misses me, while I'm alone missing absolutely everyone from my old coworkers to my high school english teacher.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Tell me I'm self-involved. It's true. I guess it would just be nice to have someone in my life who wanted to grab a beer by the river. Play a little checkers. Shoot the shit. Everybody's gone. And I've waited for too long. To face this on my own. I guess this is growing up. haha

ok I just thought of an analogy - Mai Sakurajima - she wanted to quit show business  but then she started disappearing. "

I started talking with her around 1.5yrs ago and everything was great, I really thought she's perfect. But after roughly 2month she cut it off for no reason. I found out why but irrelevant.

I heard from a mutual friend a couple months ago that she was regretting it a lot and (presumably *cried* but dunno). There was always tension between so eventually she messaged me again and I went with it just because I heard that (even though I was super annoyed by the way she ended things).

We talked on and off between aug-dec and we were somewhat upfront about whats happening between us. During that time she told me that she was scared to commit but that she can't stop herself anymore and that she wants to see what it can really be. But the bad part is that she was leaving the country for and extended period of time and, well, she left before we had the chance to agree on what were gonna do so it was left on ""we will figure something out"". Before she left she was saying how she never felt this much different things before and stuff like that.

However after leaving, she got distant within a few days and is giving me excuses that are really bad and I'm not that stupid. To add to that I have a ton of things going on in my life and just can't bring myself to chase her and exhaust myself without even knowing why I'm doing that. So now I just cut off all communication with her for good. Really frustrated that I did and it's hard but I hope it was the right call.

Even this is a TLDR version since a ton of things happened in between but I don't want to go too far it's a lot."

My symptoms are still fairly mild, but I have enough lesions in my brain to be considered “moderate”. Probably had MS for most of my life. 

About a year and a half ago I had my first relapse since my diagnosis. Got a spinal lesion that affected both of my legs and my lower back. My legs went completely numb from my hips down. I could still walk, I just couldn’t tell if my feet were on the ground. It feels exactly like they’re asleep, but constantly, for about a month and a half. 

I’ve been doing my exercises from PT, but my leg and lower back muscles are still getting weaker over time. I used to run 3 miles at 7 mph 3 days a week. Over the last year and a half the speed slowed to 6 miles per hour and then now I have to use the elliptical. My legs and my lower back aren’t strong enough to hold me up for the entire 3 miles when my core temperature increases from running/jogging. 

I have troubles swallowing sometimes. More of choking on water a lot. Sometimes I have trouble forming words correctly. My right hand is losing coordination/dexterity (I’m right handed). I limp when I walk because my right leg didn’t recover as much strength as my left which makes me slower. I don’t really like going out shopping and stuff because long walks can be a little painful on my hip because my gait is so awkward. 

When I was first diagnosed, I kept telling myself I was going to do everything in my power to stay at the same ability that I was when I was diagnosed. One relapse later and I’m not so sure what the future holds. I don’t think I’m mentally prepared for the potential future I may have. I have so much admiration and respect for people that have faced disabilities and overcome them, and I’m trying to work on myself to get the strength to face whatever the future holds, but I definitely don’t have the strength yet. 

Thanks for anyone that may read this. I know it sounds like a pity party or wanting to feel sorry for me, I don’t mean for it to sound that way and I’m not looking for pity. I’m just trying to put words to all these thoughts and feelings. My wife doesn’t like to talk about it because it makes her scared that I’m depressed (probably am) or suicidal (I’m not) and I just need to get all these thoughts and feelings out into the universe."

Finally now after over 10 years of therapy and finding myself, I pulled myself together and I’m enrolled in university. It’s been a long tough journey. It’s funny because I still hear people wish for fame but they don’t talk about the risks, that it can destroy their lives.

Literally all I do is play heartbeat sounds in a dim room and sway for 20 minutes and she’s out. Two different people were watching her together today.

I discovered why we still have the Covid pandemic ongoing.",7,1,1609285415.0,"Let me explain. First of all, I live in Central Europe, if that is relevant, but now to the point. My wife has a brother, he has a wife - whose name is not Karen, but lets use it for a nickname. So, she gets tested for Covid yesterday, turns out she is positive. 

Reaction? Karen gets defensive, tells everyone her doctor is an idiot for testing her, as she's just got a sore throat. She feels healthy, nothing is wrong with her, bla bla bla, usual Karen stuff. 

Her family's reaction? Yeap, you guessed it, full Karen-support mode. Lets give them a nickname as well, maybe 'Fockers', you know, like in this movie I once saw (it's just a nickname guys!). So now Fockers get defensive - they refuse to quarantine, as Karen is healthy, the doctor is stupid, and Covid is a general nuisance, beneath them. Here in my country if you get a positive result, Health Authority calls you and asks if you've had contact with anyone recently...

Yeap, you guessed it - Karen lies that she did not have 'any contacts'. Or maybe I'm too harsh, maybe she just forgot that recently she had two Christmas Eve dinners with extended family (her side and husbands), and over the weekend she has just hosted friends with a small baby in her house. Oh and she lives with her husband's parents and his grandma (⁷⁶ yo), but she did not mention them as well. And they live in the same freaking house. Same. Freaking. House.

Funny stuff, I know, classic Fockers, ha ha. Want more? OK, I got you. My mother-in-law (who lives with Karen), works in a supermarket, at the butchers stand. Dozens of customers daily, she hands them meat, etc. Well, she is going to work tomorrow (don't worry, she has a mask!). My father-in-law? An organist in a church, surrounded by older 'ladies & gents', whom  by looking at their age are already close to God, and who are too pious to wear a mask properly (God gave us nose to breath not to cover it!). Guess where he is going tomorrow.

Is that even necessary to mention that when me and my wife voice our strong opinion about all this, we get yelled at and totally ridiculled? Naah, what's the point, I don't want to bore y'all.

All in all, let's look for some good in all this (you might even say 'positive', ha ha). At least now I know why we have a global pandemic going on, and why it lasts so long. But it will be over soon , we have a vaccine! 

By the way, did I mention who refuses to get vaccinated?"

It makes no sense to you nor to the rest of the world, still you feel it’s right. 

Deep inside you know it, you know you have to follow that path. Eventually it will make sense.

If you feel it, follow it. Walk that path. ‘Cause damn, you miss out on a lot when you don’t.

When you’d know what’s at the end of that path, would you still walk it? If you’d know the answer beforehand, what’s the fun then? 

Knowing what’s ahead on the road, will ensure that you only focus on the obstacles. You’ll forget to look around for hidden side roads, the most amazing paths in life.

I'm 23 years old, finishing a degree in business management, but i dont know what i want to persue in my carrer as i have infinite options and areas. This has been on the back of my mind since i remember... because of this and many other reasons i feel unmotivated, depressed and stressed... i've lost my interest in computers and tech in general (which i loved), gaming, gardening and finance... i feel like evertime i have to study for a test it's like a chore and not a good thing for my future. Because of this i end up procrastinating, etc... and failling or barely passing in the tests, during which i get extremely anxious and nervous.  
I believe part of this ""depression"" is also caused by my agressive and abusive mother. I cant seem to get along with her, but as i observe, she as the same behavior with my dad and brother (21m), but in less agressive way or less frequently. I'd like to get help (shrink or something) but i fail to do iut everytime and end up promising myself after huge fights that ""next month i'll get help"", which never ends up happening.  
I'm not perfect either because i can only tolerate my mom for some time ... and then i explode.... it's a constant loop, today we're best friends, tomorrow we're fighting ... rinse and repeat for months . Once or twice i've gone 1 month without speaking to her (i live with her) but in every fight she's always the one who's right.  
I also think that because of all this stress and pressure all the time i have trouble putting on weight (184cm and 72kg it's not bad but 10kg more would not hurt). This gives me more anxiety because i feel like i'm too skinny.  
I have moments of great motivation that quickly fizzle out idk why and i feel like i'm in this constant loop that's killing me and drainning me bit by bit.   
As i'm writting this i feel like deleting it all and crying in a corner...   
The best thing in all of this is my girlfriend and her parents that motivate me and listen to me, but i always end up in this shit depressed state. I hope in 4 years time we get married and have a home, since i hope i end my degree this january, start working (have a job opportunity with my uncle) and start renovating a house that was my girlfriends' grandparents by 2022.

Side note: i consider myself as an extroverted person that can get along with anyone. i'm the type of person that thinks about others first than myself. I like to help people when i can and if i can. 

  
I'd like for you guys to share your oppinions and thoughts. 

Hope you're having a nice and festive holidays."

We stayed up pretty late and had to get up pretty early, so coach offered to make coffee for everyone who wanted some. I, an avid coffee drinker, jumped at the opportunity. The coffee was being served in red solo cups and none of them were labeled. Including my coach's. Making the coffee took more time than anticipated and we all had to run out the door to get to church on time. I handed my coffee to one of the girls to hold for a second because I had forgotten my charger and had to run and grab it. When I came back out, the girl was gone and she left what I thought was my coffee on the table next to where she was standing. Now I left this school for a multitude of reasons, but one was that all of the girls were fake and unloyal; seeing that cup there further solidified that thought. I make a mental note of what happened, grabbed the cup and left. I get in the car and the coach is blowing up our group message asking who stole her coffee. Everyone is freaking out because this coach is regularly crazy and even more so when she doesn't get her way or caffeine. So we are all trying to figure it out, but I honestly didn't care because I figured the logical thing to do would be to make another cup and move on. Coach didn't think so. The girl who I asked to hold my coffee handed me a cup when we got out of the car--my coffee--and thankfully I had already finished the one in the car and left the cup there because I was the reason for all of the fuss. It's been a few years and I'm pretty sure no one knows still. We did all get punished for it, though. I don't feel bad for that either because I hated everyone and I don't mind conditioning. Anyway I transferred to a better school at semester and the coach was fired after the following semester so all is well. I still wonder why the coach didn't use one of her own mugs, though.

TLDR; I didn't trust the girls on my team to hold on to my coffee as they walked to the car before me, so when I came out to a red solo cup next to where the girl I asked to hold it was standing, I assumed it was mine and took it. It was not."

Her teacher took her out of school and drove her to a doctors appointment and sat in on the appointment with her which, as far as i can find, seems to be illegal as he never got her mother’s permission to do so. 

She has underlying mental issues so she is super vulnerable. My sister was told 10 mins before the appointment that it was happening. She also spends all of her lunch and break times with him. 

She has a “chill out” pass to get her out of class if she needs it but she uses it to just go and sit in his classes, she has a twin sister whos said shes never in any class longer than 10 mins and she doesn’t care about rules anymore and if she gets in trouble for breaking rules she will run straight to his class. 

He talks to her about other pupils and who he likes and doesnt and he also called the doctor a prick to her face after he had sat in on the appointment. 

Shes started totally acting up shes assaulted her dad and is calling her mum awful names. 

My sister (her mum) has no clue what to do and our mum has passed away and has no one to get advice on. So ive had to take it all on myself and will need to start making calls to the police (non emergency number ofc) and i will need her to call the school.

i don’t know. i see my cousin a lot and she loves me, she doesn’t seem to be uncomfy around me or weirded out by me. i’ve never talked to her about it, mostly because i’m terrified of my family hating me and thinking i’m some monster. 

it only happened a few times and it never happened again because, if i remember correctly, i told her “god doesn’t like that.” my 10 year old brain was so scared of going to hell for it. 

am i a horrible person? i would never touch a child now, obviously, and i logically understand that it can’t be considered predatory because i was so young and, well, it just wasn’t predatory. even with all that, sometimes when i think about it, i get panic attacks to the point where i can’t breathe. like, screaming, crying, legs go wobbly panic attacks. i’m scared to tell a therapist because i don’t want to get in trouble, i guess? can i even get in trouble? i don’t think anyone would rationally look at 10 year old me and see an evil monster, but sometimes when i think about it, i do.

So when Christmas came around, I couldn’t really buy my girlfriend any gifts. But as I dabble in graphic design, I creatively made her a few things she really liked. Like a weird collage of photos of us, and a “relationship contract” in which I obey to give her endless foot massages whenever she wants. I thought, and she did too, that they were great gifts even though I hadn’t actually bought her anything. 

Fast forward, a friend came by (social distancing and all) and asked my girlfriend in conversation what I had gotten her. My girlfriend said nothing really and just changed the topic, very subtly, I didn’t mind and still don’t, I think, but the friend probably left wondering why and probably thinks my gifts weren’t great, or even nonexistent. 

Look, I don’t care for gifts, nor does my girlfriend, but this situation is in my head way too much. Where I feel down because I have worked all year and have not been able to come up with anything special for this time. I hate money. But that’s another convo. Haha. 

Anyway my point is, is that basically gifts are overrated and I don’t think you should really ask what someone got you, unfortunately. I think I’ve grown to understand somethings seem harmless but you’ve gotta see it from all sides. 

I hope no one reads this and wastes their time but if you have, I hope you could spoil yourself a little this Christmas and it’s been a happy time. 

It’s been good to get off my chest. My birthday is in two days so hopefully a little light is to come. 

Love from somewhere in the world"

I’m just settled in a 3 year long domestic relationship in which my girlfriend and I (21f, 24f) just have the same sex roughly three times a week. 

We both have pretty strong body issues, stemming from deep rooted food issues / Ed / all that good stuff. I am a little overweight, but mostly average (11st) she is very much overweight (20st). We have sex with the light off all the time, which suits us both pretty well - whenever we’ve had sex w the lights on, it has been massively uncomfortable, one of us has cried and we’re both pretty scared of being expressive out of fear of looking stupid. So we do it with the lights off. 

We had a place with housemates for year 1 and 2 of our relationship, which meant that when they were out (which is a lot when you live with students) we got to actually make sounds and have decent sex. Since the beginning of lockdown, we both moved in with my dad- it’s fine, we live here pretty much rent free, it’s great, she gets on with him and it’s a decent situation, but he’s a single man and we’re in a pandemic so we haven’t had a night to ourselves yet. The sex has shrivelled up, in the sense that we still have sex, but it lasts for like 10 minutes, one or both of us fake it, there’s nothing exciting whatsoever and it feels depressing. 

I’ve tried to hint at spicing things up with toys and things, but we’re both anxious about being heard. 
It’s just getting a bit depressing to think about the fact that I haven’t received head for over three months (especially when I go down on her all the time), and sometimes just being jabbed in the vagina fucking hurts ? Like it gets old ? Just do something exciting ? One time I suggested a minor change in position and it felt like one of the most exciting things that had ever happened. 

I cannot stress this enough - I am BORED with my sex life, I am almost entirely unsatisfied and I genuinely find myself excited for her to go to work so I can just lie in bed and actually come for the first time in a few weeks."

He was doing so well on the medication (was taking 4 pills a day) until last week, when he started having really painful, violent vocalizations/fainting episodes. Vet thought he was having mini-strokes but we couldn't officially diagnose because he couldn't go under anesthesia for an MRI or anything. So I made the decision to put him down Saturday, because the episodes were happening with more and more frequency and I didn't know if the MRI diagnosis would help, or what we'd do, or how I'd get him to the vet college 4 hours away. 

I adopted him when he was 8. He was with me for ten years. I expected to feel a constant sense of deep loss but right now I don't feel anything? All of my emotions feel strange. I can't talk right. I keep stopping in the middle of sentences and staring at the other person like I'm expecting them to know what I need or what my thought was. When I think about the weight of him in my arms I want to cry, so I've just. Not been thinking about him. Everything feels fuzzy, indistinct. Everything under my skin is tv static. Am I grieving? Is this grief? I just don't know. I'm doing it wrong. 

I feel like I killed him, like it was me, like everyone who has watched me try and keep him alive will now see me as a failure for not driving him 4 hours to go get an MRI or try to. Maybe he could have been fine through it. We could have fixed it. His euthanasia was so peaceful but now I feel nothing and have no thoughts.

I ordered his urn but the person on the phone kept prompting me to continue talking because I'd stop halfway through, but not like I was crying, it's like I can't make words go right. I don't know. Time isn't passing correctly. I feel like I'm nothing in a nowhere place beyond the insurmountable guilt at not getting him that MRI. Could have done so much. Could have done so more.

Ok so dying is one thing, once I was in the middle of the motorway (cars had stopped and I was standing there), I was confronted with the Mafia and I tried to run away but they immediately gunned me down and bullets pierced my back. Another is where I was in a forest full of psychopaths with a girl who I wanted to help get out safely, I went around sneaking up on them and stabbing them in the neck with a pair of scissors until they died, then this one seemingly-invincible superhuman Frankenstein-like guy came down the stairs of one of the grotty huts that the psychopaths were in, he grabbed me and lifted me up, I stabbed him in the neck but it didn't do anything, with the scissors still sticking out his neck he punched me and I smashed against the wall, the guy walked towards the girl and as my vision went blurry I died. Another was where I was in a little hotel with my dad and I overheard the owner of the hotel (an elderly woman) talking to a couple of punks there, implying that she often murders the residents of this hotel, I was about 5 or 6 when I had this dream, I tried to tell my dad but he wouldn't listen, then the woman invited all the residents to sit in a circle for a ""game"", then she went round the circle speaking weird stuff and looking at every resident, she stopped at me and started talking about something, I freaked out and punched her in the face, she turned away and held her face silently, everyone was shocked, my dad was angry at me, then the old woman said it's ok, she got out a box and said she understood and that she had a present for me, she grabbed a spanner out the box and stabbed me in the neck with it, I died. Another is where I was in the military and got the side of my neck shot off, it stung and felt warm and I put pressure on it, I wanted to talk or do something but I couldn't, I was still on my feet and didn't experience death, but I was definitely dead. Another was where Nazis invade my school, and I can respawn, first life I'm a student and the Nazi teacher and soldiers gas the classroom and we die horribly, next life I'm a Nazi solidier so I go into another full classroom and shoot the Nazi teacher in the neck, then I go outside where there's Nazi soldiers all over the corridors, I start killing them with an automatic rifle, they shoot me a few times and I die, I'm a student again and quickly tell people what will happen then escape the classroom and run away with a few others, the others get shot, it's only me and someone else, he escapes but I decide to hold them off, I start shouting at them and throwing rocks, they all shoot me and I die, then I respawn as a student again, I lock myself and someone else in a room they can't get in, we know we're dead so we have aggressive sex, I have a gun and they try to get in, I kill myself. When I was about 5 I had a dream where I was I'm Doctor who, that old lady's henchmen restrain me while she drains my blood through a straw and I grow weak, like in that Judoon episode. 

And then there's me killing people. Once there were a bunch of terrorists at a hotel, I was with my mum and younger brother, I murder all the terrorists by stealing their gun(s) and shooting them, it's a massacre, I try to run away with mum and bro but there's nowhere to go and cops are everywhere and I'm stressing the fuck out because I killed like 10-20 people so I could get life in prison but they were terrorists and me running away will only raise the charges so idk what to do, I think in the end I turn myself in. Another where I was in my primary school playground (idk why) and two idiot and non-intimidating guys were threatening to kill me, they didn't take me seriously so I sliced one in the belly with a katana, he fell to the floor and died, shocked at what I'd done, and his friend just looked at him confused, like he didn't fully grasp the situation, I screamed at him to fuck off and he did. Another was where I had a friend who was really nice but he went insane and killed a baby or raped someone or something bad I can't remember, I knew he had to die, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings because he was insane and I was all he had left, he onto trusted me and hated everyone and everything else, so I tried to cut his throat while behind him, I'm not strong so the wound wasn't deep enough, he looked at me in shock, it upset me but I stabbed him in the side of the neck until he died. Another time was in a post apocalyptic desert setting and I was enslaved and forced to cook meth (yes I'd been watching too much breaking bad), I stole a gun withmy hands still chained, shot the guy in the face, got behind a counter in the warehouse, everyone else was shooting at me, after ages of shooting I killed everyone there, the slaves were free so I escaped (that wasn't really a nightmare though). Another was where there were two kids from my school in my room, it was really dark and creepy, they were demons or something, they kept playing around with me, like throwing me around and making me hallucinate and changing the gravity etc, eventually as I was scared and stressed I killed one of them, the other did nothing but laugh histerically, then his face went serious and he killed me by shoving his hand into my stomach, I came back as a demon (or whatever he was, he looked normal but was evil) like him and my dad came into my room to see what the racket was, we both started laughing hysterically while staring at him and he stared back, he tried to slam the door and run but we flew after him and I woke up. And possibly the worst thing I've done in a dream is mentioned on my other post, but this is stupid and a waste of time so I'm not going to continue this post."

Most of the time they don't last too long because one of us gets busy or we lose motivation or they just leave.
It saddens me briefly but then I move on to another.

A month ago, I found the perfect partner. They were forgiving, and clear on what they wanted, and the plot we came up with, is easily the best story I've ever been a part of.

They get busy sometimes with work, not responding until late at night, and sometimes responses take a day or two, but I don't care because they've got a life, and this roleplay is worth the wait.

It's been five days since they've responded, and it was so sudden. No explanation, no warning, and their profile says they haven't been active. 
It's not the time that I'm worried about, I'm worried about them. Did something happen to them?

I probably care too much, but anyway, I really hope they're okay and they come back. Also, the roleplay is in the middle of an action scene lol

Point is if they see this post, hey, it's me, here is a message for them.

If you're seeing this, know that I don't care that it's been a couple of days, just please get back to me soon, and please, please let me know that you want to quit or if you want to take a break. Making me wait is really starting to worry me because this is so unlike you. I know I care too much, and I'm not very good at this, but I miss the rp.
Just know, this rp has been the best I've ever done, and I hope you have a good life.
Bye.

Whenever I’ve said anything online about how I don’t like that my height isn’t attractive, I’ll get a response along the lines of me being no less of a man or no less strong than someone tall. I don’t give a shit about that, as I only care about how attractive and or unattractive my height can make me. I’d be fine being the shortest and weakest guy in the world if it was considered very attractive, so I don’t really have a Napoleon Complex or some stupid shit like that. I just hate that what’s considered attractive for height seems to be an objective quality, I.e, taller being more attractive and shorter not so much.

A little background, I’m a college student currently on a premed track (it’s a dream for me to become a doctor and help those in need.) Who has also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety so it’s a bit rough but it is what it is. Regardless, helping and working with people is what I really throughly enjoy because honestly, it just makes me feel really happy. So yeah that’s it about myself!

Today was a different but special kind of day. I don’t really pay attention to my surroundings because I’m always looking down on my phone or vibing to music. But, my phone died so the only thing I could do is look at my surroundings. I noticed this one guy with a cat (super cute btw) writing Happy New Years on a piece of cardboard and to me that was just very wholesome. It’s wholesome because, a loooooot of people ignore homeless people especially in New York. But you can’t blame them, some probably have family to feed or don’t have money, etc.

Anyways, I saw that the guys money jar barely had enough money (on top of that he has a cat to support) so I bought the guy a meal from mcd. It’s not much but, he was so ecstatic when he received it and was extremely grateful. Honestly it made me cry a little but I’m a crybaby so it doesn’t really matter. But yeah it really made me think on how I should be more grateful. I may not have any close friends or someone to have a shoulder to lean on but I still have my family, food and roof on top of my head. Just to see him still smile despite being homeless really felt bittersweet to me and that feeling just left me questioning myself.

I don’t know honestly, it’s a really small deed and experience but, it made me want to be a better person and be more grateful :)






ps: I’m planning on heading out again and buying a scarf and some soup for the guy because winter is rough here and hopefully a little goes a long way :)

Also sorry for the horrible grammar and sentence formatting, I didn’t have enough sleep last night!!!!"

Can’t complain millions of other people just like us are going through this shit
Anyways this post is about you two :,)
You guys have been there with me from the start, you’ve seen me grow from being a complete asshole who had some serious anger issues, depression,no friends, had a bunch of enemies, a total loser to someone whose changed his perspective life(still depressed but still) , met so many wonderful people who I’m confident will stay in my life for a long time , to being more cautious on who to trust
You guys have been the absolute realest to me
When I couldn’t study shit you couldn’t lmao
We are that tight
12th is considered the most important for a student following CBSE and we three had slacked so fucking much..it’s like we actually did study back in 10th and 11th
Most people start realising its high time to start touching your books at least a month before the boards but oh boy about us three that’s a whole other story
And when the boards were just a fucking week away we took your(Gautam’s) car and just drove off almost every fucking day
crazy how my mom was chill with it idek what got into her but that last two weeks before boards are moments that will forever be imprinted in my brain...it felt like a fucking movie we had no fear about the exams , we gave zero fucks , it was perfect :,)
We only have an exam left and I hope it gets canceled but I don’t really care anymore
We won’t get the best marks duh but for the amount of time we slacked I’m sure we’ll still get a seasonal aggregate and I’m fine by that
I realised all the hype about scoring well for 12th is absolute bullshit...
quarantine really did fuck us up in the ass,
Well it’s fucking everyone in the ass damnit
But yea, else just gotta keep it in for a while
And once this shit is over I’m not leaving for college until I get another whole day just for us
I wanna get wasted , I wanna be high , I wanna do the craziest shit before we all leave and I can guarantee you guys we will

I love you 🖤"

Tldr; quit my job, got a better one, my contract got renewed with lowered pay, i hate everything.

I worked at awful place earlier, but as a permanent employee. I applied to my current job, got to interview and got applied as a temp with a chance of renewal. This place has a habit of having each worker for 2 temp contracts before hiring them as perm. And i get it, its just smart for the business as firing people nowadays is almost impossible atleast in Finland, so its a good way to find good perm employees.

For real this is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Every single day for the last 9 months i have worked here i have been happy about this job, and very happy about the hefty pay upgrade i got. Even just wrote a stupid half motivational facebook post about how happy i was after leaving my old job and how every single person should do so too if they arent happy in their current job and how much i loved being in my current place.

Only thing that has bothered me has been the fact that me, not my coworkers, nor my boss knew if i would get new contract when the old one ended.

Well, 7 workdays before my contract would end, my boss told me im getting a new contract for 6 months. Again, this is decided by even bigger boss, one that i have never even talked to. Well thats good news. Clearly i am worthy of this place and if i keep up the good work, i would get a permament position. 

Well, the next day my boss asks me if i got the new contract, i said nope, not yet. They changed how i get paid. Not my boss, the bigger boss, the one i have never talked to or has even seen me working. Well anyway, they are doing changes to MY wage, and my total wage gets lowered by like 10-30%. Nothing illegal here. My contract ended and i got another one.

My perm coworkes will still get the same pay as before. Our wage is combination of basic hourly rate plus large bonus from the amount of work done. I lost that bonus. They paid it to me earlier, and now just wont. What the hell am i going to say about that? Hey i dont know if im working here in a week but you need to pay me more? nope. 

I feel so fucking used, like worthless piece of shit. Every single day i have come here and done my best, literally every single day. Do more and more work than others, just so everybody would surely know that i am a hard worker and worthy of this place. And really? This is what i get? 

Im a so bitter. Yep, this is still a great place to be. Yep, i still get paid even more than in my earlier job. Im not happy anymore. Im afraid this bitterness will just turn me into lazy bad worker who wont get hired as a perm, or it just overcomes me and ill rage quit or it ruins my personal life as im so unhappy.

9 months, of doing your absolute best everyday, and this is what i got? It really annoys me that the people in charge of contracts dont have a single idea of what kind of person i am. Sure my supervisor will say that yeah he should be hired, but jesus christ. It clearly doesnt matter if i do 30% of extra work everyday or do the absolute minimum, i just get fucked in the ass anyway. No one will know, no one will care. Just another cog in the machine. I have never been in a large international company like this, i get its just business but damn, did not know i would ever get to see something like this."

I am an Arabic women who moved to the United states About 5 years ago. I am the oldest daughter of 5 kids and have always been EXTREMELY close with my family. I met a guy who is my soulmate about 2 years ago and we moved in together. 

I was only able to move in with him in secret as this is a BIG no no in the muslim community and absolutely horrid idea for a father to know his daughter is living with another man before marriage. I was able to do this because my father was still in the middle east , so it was not to hard to hide it from him.

Well, my father moved to the united states and i continued to lie and hide it until i couldn’t take the double life i was living, so i told him everything. Even though i knew he would make me move out or my boyfriend move out. I accepted this.

My father then told me that i cannot visit him at his house or he visit me at mine which was stupid because we had practically built a life together! And that is when i told my father no. Now me and him haven’t talked in a year. 

The reason this is eating me up inside is my father has always been an amazing father and I’ve always been his number one, I love him so much and he does not deserve the lying and hiding and he most certainly doesn’t deserve me to not talk to him anymore. At the same time, I Don’t believe that i should live my life based on what my father thinks is whats right and wrong. Im 27 years old and i should be living my life by MY values. 

I miss the relationship we had and i miss him so much and i feel so guilty for the decision i made ( basically picking a relationship between me and my boyfriend) over a relationship with him. But i cannot be controlled and told how to live. 

How do i live with my decision and live my life happy with the boyfriend after this has happened, i feel like i lost a part of my soul. Did i make the right decision in the first place ? How can i live everyday knowing i am constantly doing something he does not approve of ? And is that even healthy to care about?

Please help, i feel like i am going crazy and cant move forward with confidence in myself."

I don't know how to explain or where to start. Like i said, in 9 months no one ever tried to contact me. I had ""friends"" (i mean 3 or 4 people) at school (btw i'm 17) before quarantine but we weren't so close. 

&#x200B;

Before quarantine it was easy to deal with loneliness (with the help of games, books, movies) but in quarantine it is very hard.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I wanted to text ""them"" but i know if i will, they will not take me seriously. I know because even before quarantine none of them were listening me or took me seriously. I mean they weren't bully or something, actually they are good people if you meet and talk with them (that's why i was ""friend"" with them) I think it just because they were more good friend among themselves and I am boring person.

&#x200B;

But nobody tried to text me.

&#x200B;

Every night i thinking about text anybody and tell them about my problems and feelings but I know it wont help. Nobody will take me seriously. And I know, after this moment no one ever will save me from this situation. Because nowadays, people thinks you are weak when you tell them about your feelings, problems and things makes you sad.

&#x200B;

I even tried to get along better with my family.(it didn't worked well, they only care about my grades whatever.)

I tried to keep myself strong but i cant take it anymore. 9 MONTHS. Actually I have never had friendship that lasted more than 3 months. I don't know. Maybe I am a very bad person to friend or too boring, too lazy, too dumb...idk.

And knowing that there is no solution to that hurts me. In 6 weeks my school will be open and nothing will change.

I had no social skills and a 8th grade education, on top of debilitating anxiety/agoraphobia. I wanted mental help so bad, but none was available to me. I had no one I was close to at all, and my self esteem was annihilated by abuse.

I know I’m “too old” to valet past trauma for my life. But, honestly, I don’t know if 18-22 yo me was capable of being anything else. I had no tools and no help. 

Things started to get better for me at 24/25 when I left a shitting relationship with an older man. I started college, was going well, and actually started learning how to make friends. But the I met my current bf and let him take over my life. I love him, but he can be so demanding of my time and energy. This pandemic hasn’t helped at all. In the last year I’ve had to put off school, my gpa dropped significantly in the time I did take classes, and I had to go back to my old teenage job where I have nothing to learn and everyone knows me as the weird quiet person.

Only now, I feel like it’s too late to go back to the woman who was starting to find herself. At my age, everyone thinks my career goals are dumb and I should just start having babies. I don’t want kids. I want to live my life. I’m so fucking sad."

Due to COVID-19 and changing houses a bit before that, the only people I could easily hang out with was my family. Spending time with mum became a nice past time and it made me realize so many things about her and everything.

All my life, my mom told me and my sister to not to be like her. In a sense, not to neglect education or think that the money spent on our education is a money spent better elsewhere. On the face value, I thought it was her frustration as a housewife or just her low self esteem. Fact that Dad's always working didn't help deal with such issues. She got married when she was 19, basically cause she didn't believe in herself and an arrange marriage felt fine to her. My dad didn't have a lot of assets when they got married but had a lot of financial responsibilities like getting his sisters' married. They love each other now but at the time, it was a huge struggle financially and emotionally. Her self worth kept diminishing.

I had seen her grow in the past few years when she started working part-time (wasn't for the money, just a way to see the world around), started learning how to drive again after considering her to be a useless driver (she drives well, just low self esteem), and when she started taking interior designing courses on her own will. Even with such growth, these days I see her faltering at every step as she deals with her past.

For interior designing, the industry uses AutoCAD. Computers scared her, especially that software. Her entire passion faded due to fear. She started using any means of distraction to get away from the feeling of disappointment like playing a lot of mobile games or just talking to people who gossip all day. The sense of failure haunted her.

That's the negatives. The positives: she got invested in gardening and still made a lot of alterations in the houses, some complex designs etc or just simple DIYs. It took me a month to convince her to try making planters and if it's a success, sell it online. She's convinced to try but is still really hesitant. 

Honestly, even if I see a lot of potential in her, idk how to make her realize it as well. My family is filled with clashing stubborn-minded people. The fact that she handles us well makes me believe she's capable of handling a bigger or professional crowd as well. But the fact is, my beliefs just comes off as all talk or all affirmation to her. Idk where to start to make her realize her worth."

It wasn't even like I was being pushy about it. It was a simple ""Do you think I'm pretty?"" out of the blue. ""Why are you asking me that?"" ""I don't know. I just don't feel good. I'm exhausted all the time. Is it so bad I asked?"" And the response just crushed me: ""It's your problem if your having self-esteem issues."" The response came out of nowhere and just felt like a complete slap in the face.

Like why is it so bad to ask? 

I'm kind of sick of him coming home and being like ""I got a compliment today. I was told I looked really young for my age,"" ""I was hit on today. They were sad I'm taken."" Like Thanks?

I'm over here hearing them compliment their friends when they doll up and I'm putting the same effort, if not more, and nothing.... Not a single ""You look nice.""  


I'm at this weird place because I feel my age creeping on me now. I look my age for the first time in my life (I always looked younger). I'm exhausted and rushing everywhere. My body is constantly changing as it's prepping for whatever the hell transition it wants now. I LOOK exhausted, no matter how much effort I put into not looking it.  


But he ""shows me"" how attractive he thinks I am by hitting my butt...or grabbing my waist fat (seriously!) . I'm kind of at the point where slapping my butt doesn't tell me anything. Timing, right? Why when I'm washing the dishes (and could potentially drop a glass cup) or cleaning our home. But NOT when I take the time to get ready and wear nice lingerie? Why is there nothing then? Should I just throw that out along with my make-up and go full t-shirts and jeans?

  
I dunno. I'm just a bit of a mess right now. I finally got to wear this long-sleeve I thought would fit well and it doesn't. It makes me look two sizes bigger than I am (with bullet shoulders). It's still a very pretty shirt and works as PJs, maybe? but I wanted it fitted a bit. This memory popped up when I was going to ask ""How does it look?"" so I stopped.

I have a dream of one day finding a great girl and fulfilling my dream of having a loving family and kids. I want my kids to have a better life than I have had in my childhood and although it may seem pretty mediocre, having a happy family and wife is the biggest goal in my life, it’s always on my mind, the idea of codependency Is something that keeps me up at night, I’ve never had anyone to talk too, I’ve always had to do everything myself really. The idea of being a team with somebody you love, with your best friend seems like it’s fake, like it’s only in the movies and real life relationships are just suffering with another person. 

My parents have also extensively cheated on each other, which has led me to have a fear of being cheated on, I’ve experienced what it does to a family, I’ve experienced how terrible infidelity is too a household. I just can’t imagine caring about somebody and being betrayed, my sister tells me marriage isn’t supposed to be the way it is with my parents but I don’t even know. I’m up late at night dreaming of having actual love for somebody, it consumes me. 

I don’t know what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like, if it’s like my parents relationship l, I don’t want anything in life, the idea of what I’ve described for some reason feels so fuckin unrealistic, like I’m asking to fly. 

Will ever have what I want ? Even if I do, who says she doesn’t make it all come crashing down with infidelity?  These thoughts torture me everyday, every fucking day."

No joke i just sat and stared at the wall for 6hours straight. They literally made me go and I dont understand why, none of them tried to converse with me, only his uncle did, but other than that no one wanted to talk to me.

I was in the kitchen with his uncle, brother, and cousins and once in a while his mum or grandma would come in and smoke, no joke his grandma literally smoked OPPOSITE me and it was so bad I tried to not smell it in. The only interaction I had with his grandma is her saying hey f4tty! or are you alright f4tty! which was a bit weird since that's the only thing she said to me but I didnt mind it that much, since I'm not actually fat I weight 40kg and I'm only like 2m preg.

Some family members would say such sly comments to my boyfriend and I felt so uncomftarble, saying how he could've kept it in his pants as a joke and to me that was pretty disrespectful since only a day before that he told them that he's having a baby, or they would talk about sexual stuff and it made me feel so awkward to listen to that. 

What really pissed me off is whenether my boyfriend would say something or whatever, his mother would turn around to me and say ''and THIS is who you're having a baby with by the way'' like say it once ha..ha.. i'll fake laugh but she literally said this like 8x that day no exaggeration, she's been saying this everytime I've seen her too, it's annoying. I was only on 2hours sleep so I was getting really groggy and just wanted to go home, and his mum said if I'm tired to go and lie down, but I don't want to sleep in someone else's bed, if I'm tired I should be allowed to make my own choice to go home.

And when I was about to leave she said ''i know this is too much for you'' and in my head i was like wtf too much? i'm f\^cking tired, my eyes are burning from all the smoke, the only interaction i'm getting is annoying comments and this is too much? no i'm tired, bored and groggy. I've been here for 6 hours and that's more than enough.

Also I would liek to point out his mother always disliked me,she always says that my boyfriend is still ''his baby'' and she does get a bit jealous, I've been with my boyfriend for 8 years and she PURPOSELY called me by the wrong name, she called me Polo for the last 8 years.

She also overheard what me and my boyfriend used to say to eachother, and started saying that to him...now i stopped saying it cause it feels weird. like she would say ''i love you'' and he would go ''i love you too' and she would say ''i love you more'' and then ''i love you most'' cringe.

She keeps telling me what I cannot eat even though she's wrong...telling me how I can't eat mayonnaise, even though it's safe to eat, the other day I tried eating a small snickers candy and she said YOU CAN'T EAT THAT! and I said why?... and she said cause it has nuts in it and your baby might be allergic!! like wtf? nuts are high in protein and it's one of the things I SHOULD be eating, I'm not allergic so there's literally no problem, and it's safe to eat...

Most annoying part is that when she was pregnant with my boyfriend not only SHE SMOKED, in her words 3-4 cigs a day, she also had a alcoholic drink at the end of the night after work...I don't smoke, I haven't drank since freaking October and she's telling me what I can't eat?

I KNOW for a fact she'll be telling me how to parent & shit.

My boyfriend wants us to spend 25th christmas day with his family every year and i really, really REALLY rather not. Not only that it's a ridiculously long time from 10am-12pm/1am which is 14 hours that's crazy to me, and they drink that early too which is even more ridiculous.

With my family, we celebrate max like 2 hours around the table, and then go do wtf you want, it's only me, my sis and my mum and I like having a small christmas.

And I would rather have my OWN small christmas, since we're basically creating our own family i don't understand why I have to be forced to spend time there. I prefer having a less stressful, small, quiet, non alcohol type of christmas but they have the opposite.

I just don't know what to do, I don't really want to spend time with strangers, it was only me, my sister and my mum when I was younger and that's what I'm comfortable with."

“I didn’t want a shitty marriage.” - you didn’t want to fix it- you wanted to fk someone else. Did you think that would improve our marriage?

“I don’t want a divorce, that’s never what I wanted” - I didn’t want to be married to a cheater - some times we don’t get what we want. If you wanted your marriage- shoulda worked on it instead of working someone else’s d***. 

“I’ve changed. It’s not who I am.” - so what? I’m sure plenty of people in prison feel the same- they don’t get a free pass. Neither do you. 

“It was a mistake” - um no. It takes for more effort to become a compulsive liar and manage a relationship while married- than it does just to work on your marriage. It was an on purpose.

I never asked her stay. I’ve asked her to look elsewhere. I’ve encouraged her to leave. 

No one is forcing her to stay or even asking her to. 

I’m not going to love you. Divorce is in the future. If you want it sooner, find a lawyer. 

It’s been 10 years. Stop trying and accept the date of the marriage. 

It’s together. For now. Until I feel the kids are old enough to not hate one of us for the separation. Enjoy it while it lasts- or gtfo."

I still enjoy things I just have no motivation for any of it. I try to control just one thing by logging my food and trying to lose weight but even that I’m giving up a lot more now, just not caring. I know a lot of this is it’s a stressful year, and a stressful time of year anyway. I’m unemployed and seemingly can’t escape that loop. I’ve progressed my chronic pain but it’s still there. Every day is exhausting, it’s the same loop, but I feel guilty for breaking that loop. I feel guilty every time I do or think or feel something that might impact someone negatively. If I don’t look after the bird every day who will. If I don’t sit downstairs with him who will. If I don’t cook who will. I enjoyed these things, and to an extent still do. But I just want to have one day where I don’t have to do the same monotony and have control over what I want. It doesn’t feel like a life and it’s exhausting and everything feels like it’s out of reach. I want to just not feel this, to feel happy, to be able to read a book or go on a walk without giving up or getting stressed, to live a life for me, to have some control and not just coast by.

Being home for the holidays has been alright. I still feel like I can’t be myself. I can’t have opinions.

My mom always says that my dad and his family hoards. She always wants him to throw things away. We have a lot of stuff that could be gone through but it’s not near those people you see on TV.

IMO, my mom has been hoarding food because of the pandemic. Our freezer is stuffed. She buys an extra milk and creamer carton a week ahead of when we need it. The pantry is stacked.

We’re a family of 3 - two when I’m at school. I don’t know how she doesn’t see the irony in telling my dad he’s making a mess. 

On top of everything, she’s taken up ceramics and we have no good place to put everything she’s made. There are piles of mail and papers on the countertop and she complains that she has no room in our small kitchen.

My dad works all day and is exhausted by the end. She is a housewife, which is a job itself.

I tried to voice my opinions in saying that I think there is too much food in the freezer. All I said is “I think this is a lot”. She raised her voice and said that I wouldn’t understand that she’s just “thinking ahead”. That I just go out and buy something whenever I want it. I’ve done that once while I was here. It was ice cream because she doesn’t eat sweets.

I’m 20. I feel like I don’t have any autonomy. I know I have some, but not enough."

It feels like I should always be somewhere else. The minute I start to relax and enjoy whatever holiday, I remember there’s the other parent/family waiting for me, and I start to feel guilty. It’s both of my parents’ fault for never sticking to their holiday agreement. Now that I’m technically an adult it’s up to me, so all the pressure lies on me. It feels like every choice I make is the wrong one. There’s always someone missing me and I always feel like that’s my fault. They both say the wrong things and then backtrack because they shouldn’t try to influence my decisions, but at that point the damage has already been done.

I feel awful for my parents, but they don’t seem to feel awful for me."
