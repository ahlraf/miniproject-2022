Like literally once he got his presents from my family he left. And I really mean he just left me.

Took my wallet took my Nintendo switch and my AirPods and then refused to give them back. He told me he wouldn’t give me my things back. That he couldn’t just give them back. I said I’d pick them up at our place, he locked me out and told my roommates I lost my mind and not to let me in. So now he has my things left to another state and told people I can’t get my things because I’m crazy. I could call the police but I honestly don’t want to make a scene or feel like a stalker. My friends took me out to drink so I feel better but it just sucks that someone took my wallet and clothing and my electronics and won’t give them back. He said he flew to Virginia already as well.

I've been struggling with ED for years (primarily anorexia or binge/laxative), and lately I have been drinking more than usual. (Praise the pandemic!) I struggled with binging when hungover for YEARS until more recently. Then I did not eat much, but I felt my hangovers were far more brutal and lingering when I did not consume as many calories. But now I've been gaining weight as a result after being underweight for years...

Conflict of interests. 


Recently, I've been struggling to find a common ground. How do you handle the urge to binge eat while hung over? Any tips? I want to maintain a healthy (or lower) weight, but FUCK these disorders conflict sometimes!

k78q76,https://www.reddit.com/r/drunkorexia/comments/k78q76/support/,Support!,13,2,1607179771.0,"Hi guys,

If you haven’t come across the following groups, they’re wonderful:

r/stopdrinking 
r/Alcoholism_Medication 

Both are kind, welcoming communities of people in many stages of confronting their struggles. 

I personally read r/stopdrinking for a long time after being overwhelmed by two separate disorders (and found that there are lots of people over there from ED communities! Not too surprising). Their candor and courage inspired me, after more than a year of trying and failing to quit/moderate, to speak with my PCP and ask for medication. 

I tried Naltrexone first and then ended up on disulfiram, which works wonders for me because—maybe incongruously for someone who struggles with both eating and alcohol—I’m terrified of throwing up! The most effective part is that the effects can last as long as two weeks after taking a pill. Sometimes I have moments of really wishing for a drink but then realize that it’s off the table for many days out, and just keep taking the disulfiram. I feel incomparably better.

Of course everyone’s different— r/Alcoholism_Medication is a great place to find people trying and retrying various options. I wanted to try and pay it forward by sharing my experience just in case it might help to motivate anyone else to talk with their own doctor for support, whether or not that involves medication.

Warm wishes for peace and wellbeing 🙂"

On top of it all I had an argument with my boyfriend and every time I think about it I just wanna cry and drink more and not think about it.

I’m currently inpatient but I really don’t want to tell my dr in case he transfers me to ED treatment, or just tells my parents bc they don’t understand that there’s ed’s other than anorexia, and you don’t have to be underweight to be ill etc etc.... 
anyways so does anyone know if nosebleeds can be caused by frequent purging? And is it a sign of something more serious?"

jgu0n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/drunkorexia/comments/jgu0n7/_/,:),16,1,1603481473.0,the other day was my off day so i decided to drink a lot more than i usually do. my older sibling wanted to drink too so we got lit together which was fine (even though i usually like drinking alone tbh). She asked me to get her some pizza n i was down to go pick it up since i was nearly black out n just wanted a reason to go for a 6 mile walk. right before i go we get in a stupid argument because we were fucked up n miscommunicating n we couldnt find a pizza place to order from so i decide to just go for a walk anyway. She starts texting me super angrily n im confused as hell bc i thought it was just a quick misunderstanding but nah shes like straight up pissed at me. turns out she was just super confused and thought i was coming at her wrong but we end up settling it. i finally find a pizza place to order from. So im fully fucked up in the pitch black night with my super old glasses with an outdated prescription walking for miles with no type of knife or pepper spray. Im like 3 blocks from the spot at this point n start crossing the super busy street . my keys fall out in the middle of the road. Cars are rushing down the street and i notice someone across the street from me. staring at me.. then my keys and back at me. I start feeling nervous (not just bc of the stranger also bc my fucking keys are being run over by cars going 50 mph and im worried as fuck) finally the traffic comes to a stop and i run into street to grab my keys and the stranger straight up books it right at me. like full speed just coming at me. so i haul ass to the pizza place (luckily didnt drop my keys again) n the stranger ends up just walking away as if nothing happened?? like they didnt just chase me??????? Anyway I end up getting to the pizza spot safely (against all odds) n walk home feeling mad paranoid. I get home feeling relieved and walk downstairs to give my sib the pizza n shes knocked out. Like fully asleeep. so i put the pizza down n go to my room to take a breather n try to stay calm even though im a tiny bit pissed that i just wasted all that time n energy n money for her to not even eat the pizza. Its not that deep but i was still a lil upset. also upset bc i was fasting n now theres just... a pizza in front of me. I end up going back out to check on her n shes still asleep but her dog got to the pizza which i stupidly didnt move out of reach from him. He barfed it up. So i cleaned it up n tried to make sure he was ok (he ended up being totally fine he just ate way too fast). So i ended up going on this weirdly unsafe long ass walk to get that damn pizza just to clean up barf n go to sleep. i am a fool 😔

Ok, so here's the situation

On July 5th, I stopped drinking.  I recognized that I was relying on alcohol a little too much, and I wanted a little bit of a liver reset.  I also kinda wanted to loose some weight.

I almost immediately experienced a relapse of my anorexic and orthorexic tendencies.  Between July and 2 days ago, I haven't eaten over 1200 cal per day.  For the last THREE WEEKS (excluding last night), I've eaten exactly 700 cal every day.

Last night, I had a shot of vodka, and then ate a Taco Bell veggie crunchwrap and 5 fiber one brownies.  It was definitely a bit of a binge, but it wasn't awful, all things considering.  And I feel okay (not great, but okay) about it today.  

I'm debating adding alcohol back into my diet.  Not a ton, but enough to make my OCD/ED brain shut up and allow myself to eat a little more intuitively.  I think its going to be good for me... but I'm nervous.  I recognize that I'm a bit of a functioning alcoholic, and I currently feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, by choosing between alcoholism and an eating disorder.

Do any of you navigate this?  Any advice, thoughts, or feedback would be more appreciated than you can know!"

But currently my tinnitus is phasing rapidly between that high pitched sound I described, but exceptionally louder, and a ringing bell sound which is deafeningly louder as well as distracting and distressing.

I was raped while wasted in a different country. I blamed myself, relapsed into every bad coping mechanism, drank everyday, felt myself wanting to die, and overall just couldn’t do anything but move my body from room to room as I spiraled deeper and deeper into alcohol and anorexia. 

Then I started going to therapy and someone told me I wasn’t actually a selfish burden for hating being alive. That my anger was ok. That I didn’t deserve to live miserably. And I didn’t believe. And I was told it again, and again, and again. I also have debilitating chronic migraines, and for the first time my pain was actually legitimized. Other people agreed I was in pain, but because a migraine is so invisible, would never give me the help I needed. Having a migraine with friends around was like being treated like I had a scrapped knee when I really had a fractured fibula. 

As I let myself slowly believe my therapist—sometimes with a lot of lashing out, sometimes with setbacks, sometimes after ignoring his advice for weeks—I gave up alcohol for a week, or just for as long as I could. I used to drink almost every night, or at least 3 times a week. Last week I drank once.  

And now, over a year after the assault, I’m starting to believe it that I can actually recover. I just enjoyed sober sex for the first time since it happened. After the assault, I became hyper sexual when intoxicated. Two nights ago, I had a panic attack while sober in a very sweet man’s bed. He stopped. He asked me if I was ok. He sat next to me and gave me a stuffed sloth to hold and passed me my underwear and we watched a movie and ate ice cream. And then we did it again and I didn’t freak out. 

I feel like I’m finally finding the scar tissue over the wounds. Alcohol was just picking at scabs and being upset at the blood. I’m finally ready to let go of binge drinking alcohol. I still want to be able to drink responsibly—the opposite of addiction isn’t abstinence, it’s moderation. I don’t want anything to have control over me. I’m finally consciously approaching recovery from addiction, and it’s new and scary, but that just means it’s worth it to see what’s on the other side. Wish me luck 💗"

But now I’m in a rabbit hole where I can’t even think of much else. Part of me kind of started using these self destructive coping mechanisms as a way to control my surroundings.

.
I am recovered from anorexia b/p subtype about 4 years ago, but I was always able to maintain a very thin weight without any calorie counting/weighing during that time. Even when I was drinking natty daddy beer and eating ramen nightly, my weight stayed on the low end of average (bmi). 

Recently, however, I've been gaining weight (still no scale, but using mirror/clothing measures) very, very rapidly (over the past couple of months), despite my diet and drinking habits only improving. I was having missed periods/spotting, thought I was pregnant twice, but no-- just fat. 

I've never exercised in my LIFE, but since I moved, I've been walking 2 - 4 miles daily, in addition to strength training workout, and only drink liquor/diet mixers now. I monitor my caloric intake as best I can. Given the fact that I was previously not doing *any* of that, I had expected *some* kind of weight loss, even with just a minimal lifestyle change,  but I only seem to be getting fatter. 

What is wrong with me? I've got so much going on, and this is just the horrible icing on the cake-- I can't  stand how I look, and I feel like I have zero control over it anymore. Do I need to stop drinking?

TLDR: unexplained weight gain that diet and exercise isn't remedying, worried it's just the alcohol"

I go out to dinner with my boyfriend and while he's writing the check I notice he's actually writing an itemized list of all the items the movers will be taking as he moves out. He gets up to go somewhere and I grab it. He gets back and notices it in my hand and neither of us say anything, we just leave. We walk home and I say ""I had a dream about this last night, I can't believe it's real"". He says ""what's so hard to believe"" and does the same picking apart all my flaws and things he doesn't like about me. We're screaming and yelling at each other on the walk home.

Then thank god somebody texted me and I actually woke up for real this time. For a half second I was like ""oh shit is he gone? Is he going to leave when he wakes up?"". But he's still sound asleep and we had a really good day yesterday.

My default has been to have seltzers throughout the day. My Mum has literally teased me about the kind of seltzer I like, ""She only likes plain, lemon, lime, \[daughter returns home from work\] and hard seltzer, lol right?""

My boyfriend is a drinker (biology isn't a joke), and we've been patching-up things since mid-January, so we're balancing dysfunctions (some apart from these, as well). I struggle with wanting to be acknowledged for the Hellscape that I inhabit, but simultaneously, I want to be sincerely open with him. Sometimes, though, when I share with me, I feel like I'm not being heard or even trusted. 

I used to sit, feel uncomfortable, and brew under the anxiety, until I crack, end up crying from the pressure, and feeling like I've bungled the whole relationship with my insecure bullshit. BUT- at the same time, he partially understands, but only on the surface, while never looking into the depths of what ED's are like. Maybe it's the romantic in me that wishes he would do some independent-research on how some anorexics feel. I supposed, that self-teaching is a sign of affection? 

Anyway, I'm glad \[proactively sad\] that my distraction options are plentiful. With it soon being summer/drink/fresh-fruitandveg/different clothes-season, I feel like I might be better off riding-out this heated-virus wave, and face the music of ED consequences, come this Autumn. I can't come out of this quarantine looking the same as when I entered. I refuse- just as petulantly as it sounds."

tldr: got too drunk and couldn’t handle emotions, blackout googled neda hotline 

you ever think you’re doing relatively well and then one day it just hits you how bad you’re actually doing? i want to preface this with saying i’m not an alcoholic, i don’t get super drunk that often, however i don’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol and often drink for the wrong reason. i was considering quitting, but had long standing plans for a party this past weekend where the plan was to get drunk and play games, so i figured that would be a last hurrah. well got drunk, had fun, then got too drunk and went home. I ended up having an anxiety attack about bing too drunk and basically all the stress and anxiety i’ve been pushing down the last few weeks came bubbling up. i don’t remember much, but i do remember calling the suicide hotline multiple times because i was so debilitated. the next morning, i woke up and checked my browser and found that in addition to the suicide hotline, i had googled in multiple windows the neda hotline. idk why, but that really got to me? this is a problem i have trouble facing as it is, so to find out that when i’m nearly blackout drunk, that’s my response kinda shakes me. i thought i was doing well but i guess i was just fooling myself. and of course, with all this covid-19 things going on, i’m finding it really hard not to fully give in to habits. 

i don’t really know why i’m posting this.. i guess i have nowhere else to talk about it and i think i really just shocked myself that when i was drunk i was looking up the neda hotline. subconsciously i guess i think i’m bad enough to need help? to want help? i don’t even know how to react. as of right now, i’m done drinking for a while. i can’t control my emotions and i always go too far. i had even called a friend when the suicide hotline waitlist was too long and i regret reaching out to them. if you’ve read this far, thank you. sorry for this pointless post."

Nearly 6 months after my dad died, I finally brought myself to clean out some of his old clothes from his drawers last night. 

In the back of an old sock and underwear drawer, I come across a small glass jar that on first glance seemed to be full of some sort of white powder. 

Upon further inspection, it contained a white plastic bag packed in so tightly it took me several minutes to remove it. 

Inside that white plastic bag was a blue plastic bag. I thought I began to smell something faintly peppery. 

Inside that blue plastic bag was a brown paper bag. I began to get giddy. I then pulled out a terribly bent pack of rolling papers. Holy fuck, I said aloud, please be what I think this is. 

After going for months without smoking because I had to move & take care of dad’s estate, and after a particularly rough & depressing week wishing I had some, I again said aloud to myself, please let this be pot, please let this be pot....

And holy mother, it was. Granted, probably 10-15 years old, but still smelled and looked surprisingly good. I immediately recognized it must have been the homegrown my uncle had given dad long ago, that he mentioned looking for a couple years back but couldn’t find it. I smoked him out when I visited him 2 years ago, and he told me it was the first time in about 30 years that he got high. 

I’m sad my dad never found it but I’m convinced that the universe provides, and I found it when I really just needed the humor of the situation. 

As an extra bonus, I found through personal survey that it’s still potent. (“Is it still good, though? Survey says: YES!”). 

It’s the little things, man. When you’re going through a rough spot, just keep going."

first time I had to see such a thing, I did not know how much seeing large amounts of blood on other people can affect me (and I guess others too?)...  since I got ""almost""-mugged before and I grew up in a shit situation (been a long long time by now) I'm sure I will be fine tomorrow again. but damn all the blood and injured person...it could have been worse honestly, but I really am only used to have injuries on myself, I never even seen someone else be hurt... it made me wonder, at my worst times with selfharm, would others have felt similar to how I felt when I had to make sure the guy was not having a broken neck or is dead? from an outsiders perspective I think I went trough a couple of situations where one might not know if I will live or not... it makes me selfconscious... the guy was fine in the end aside from a broken dented in skull, stood up a few minutes later, but ugh.. 
I would not want anyone to get this impacted on things I more or less consciously do to myself... I never shared it much though, but damn... shaky body everywhere all allong, stuck between what I thought was almost a dead person (was not, hes fine more or less with injury), ambulance, police and the other person who was clever enough to bring a phone with him when going outside. 
just venting idk. 

it makes me wonder how so many people can be doctors etc

it also is quite weird how it was one of my most productive and good days since a while today but then this happened, do I have to believe in supernatural forces now?"

The past few months have been extra hard since my dad died, and even though I’ve been living in his house, I’ve just been in denial. I vacillate between that & breaking down from depression, so I tend to go with denial for the most part. 

Today was one of the harder days. I’ve had to come to terms with the fact I’ll have to sell his cool car back in order to pay it off. It’s not practical for me to keep it at all. I knew this time was coming, but the months just flew past me while I’ve felt stuck in time.

Had been doing good not binging/purging lately but that went out the window Tuesday or Wednesday. Back to restricting & feeling awful. 

I keep sinking to new lows (for one, I had quit smoking cigs 10 years ago and just picked it back up in December like nothing). 

I feel like a failure no matter what I do - I feel like taking time off working and career goals to just breathe and spend time with my kids means I’m getting too far behind and am going to fail; working towards any career goal feels like I’m failing my kids. It doesn’t help I feel I suck at everything, anyway. 

Worst of all has been the nightmares and bizarre dreams I’ve been having consistently for the past several months, which is probably due to all the recent stress I’ve been under, but it’s getting old and exhausting. They range from odd & mildly upsetting to horrendous terrors that wake me up crying. They tend to occur most when I haven’t been drinking, if not always ! Which is half the reason I’ve been getting near blackout drunk as much as I have. 

I was struggling with alcohol for a while but recent circumstances have not helped at all. It’s hard to go more than a day or two without liquor. I’ve recently moved and have no supply of weed or I would much prefer to be doing that, but let’s be honest, I’d probably just have both. I hate how alcohol makes me feel so out of control around food - I usually just eat safe low-carb foods but a lot more than I normally would. 

On that note, I think I’m about to pour a glass now. If you made it to the end of this post, much love to all of you, and cheers!"

This might not be the place to put this as I guess it’s not eating disorder stuff but it is all kind of related and I dunno I’m just feeling really sad and need to write this somewhere where I’m not just shouting into the void. Though I kind of am anyway. I dunno. 

I’m having such a horrible time at the moment and I don’t know what to do. I hate being back at university I’m so stressed for exams which is making me restrict so then I can’t concentrate and I end up not revising and making the stress worse which just sends me in a spiral. 

I talked to my housemate about this and he’s not really given me much support and I felt like we were really close but I guess not. He’s fucked off to the pub with our friends tonight and I wasn’t invited (even though I’ve been asking him to go to the pub with me for a few days) and I just feel like he doesn’t want to hang out with me or that he even likes me that much. I’ve spoken to my boyfriend and my best friend (both are long distance unfortunately whilst I’m at uni) and they think he’s being shit, so does my counsellor. 

I just can’t bring myself to not be his friend anymore. I have no friends here as I’m doing my masters and most of them left at the end of last year. He’s one of my closest friends and now I live with him and it just seems like he doesn’t value me. This is such a childish, stupid post and I don’t even know what I’m asking for. I just feel so fucking alone and sad. I want to go buy a bottle of wine and cry myself to sleep but I’ve been drunk for the past three nights and I’m getting no work done as a result of the hangovers so I really can’t afford another day off. Fuck this honestly."

first off, you’ll be compensated via cashapp.

i just need someone who doesn’t really use instagram or care about it, to dm screenshots and a message to this account. i don’t want to see their response either in case they defend the person (it’ll trigger me) you’ll need to block them after you see that they’ve seen the message. please do not engage with them. (dm for more details.) i need help exposing a rapist.

i really don’t want to be found out that i sent someone to do this. i’ve been through enough.

preferably a person with no morals who gives no fucks and is happy to do it."
