But this year especially its just like...... what did I stay for? Lmao like..... I'm here purely out of obligation for everyone else (since I am lucky enough to have a good support group). Every day just has snowballed into more and more of a nightmare.

But still. Saying this generally because I don't really want to go into politics, but America is just going to get worse. The hopeless doesn't just come from negative thinking or trying to be a downer, its coming from a place of ration.

I have young ones in my life as well as friends who are struggling in many different ways. It keeps me here, strong ideation more than actual planning, but I'm so fucking tired. I don't know how much more of this I can take and truly think I'm going to die at 70 regretting not kms earlier. I don't even have all that terrible life considering, but I'm losing my fucking mind."

This is Atleast my 5th breakdown I’ve had this year and the difference this time is that I’m on 40mg Prozac. I feel like it worked(at first) but now a guy just broke my heart and now I’m depressed and sleeping all the time. I have 0 motivation to do anything and pretty soon I’m sure I’m going to return to my old suicidal self. Thinking of increasing to 60mg hoping that it helps. I just feel so alone I have so many responsibilities(work, school) and this depression is making it SO HARD to get things done. I don’t know what to do my therapist and doctor both left me. And it’s New Year’s Eve so I cant really see anyone. Thinking of having myself committed but embarrassed because this would be my FIFTH time being in a hospital for being depressed. Any advice I feel so lost right now?"

knv63a,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/knv63a/so_sick_of_feeling_dead_inside/,So sick of feeling dead inside...,4,0,1609438999.0,"Well, it's officially the end of 2020. Here's to a better year, yeah? I can't celebrate though, right now I'm feeling pretty depressed. I suppose I should explain. My depression tends to come and go, sometimes it gets better and other times it gets worse. It's always there, but some days are better than others and it can even vary hour by hour. I was diagnosed with dysrhythmia (I think that's how it's spelled?) which means I have a low-level, constant depression. I think it's also sometimes referred to as chronic depression. It was a problem before the pandemic began, but since then it's gotten worse I think. I also have anxiety disorder and OCD (and I guess technically PTSD because I was abused as a child by my older brother. Yes, it is possible to be abused by your older sibling, people think it can't happen but it can.)

Long story short, I've been on antidepressants since high school and doing talk therapy with this one therapist I'm very attached to. I'm a 24 year-old woman btw, just for reference. The antidepressants have done wonders for my anxiety, I no longer suffer from frequent panic attacks like I used to. At one point, in my second year of high school, my anxiety got so bad that I became agoraphobic, I could barely leave my house and I was missing classes. That's when my parents and I finally got desperate enough to seek psychiatric help (before that I went to talk therapy but took no medication). So that's a positive I guess, the SSRIs I've been taking have helped immensely with my anxiety. Unfortunately they haven't done as much for my depression or low self-esteem (or social anxiety). 

Now, during the pandemic, it's even worse and I just can't take it anymore. I'm so sick of feeling numb and having almost zero motivation. I feel like a zombie, and I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life anymore. Even the things I do care about, I don't care enough about them to push past any challenges that come my way. I balk at the first sign of resistance. I'm afraid I'll never be able to get a job and become a productive member of society, because I have low self-esteem and struggle to ""sell"" myself to potential employers. I don't have any job experience, either. Honestly, if it weren't for my supportive parents (especially my mother) I don't think I could go on. They are my whole world, which is kinda pathetic for a 24 year-old, huh? I literally don't think I could live without them, and I live in fear of someday losing them. Fears which have only been exacerbated by this stupid pandemic. It feels like nothing works, talk therapy doesn't work, medication doesn't work. Granted, I haven't really tried other medications, but I'm afraid to because what if my panic attacks come back? I can't remember a time when I didn't have anxiety/depression, I can't remember a life before when I was mental illness-free. In some ways I wonder if I didn't always have anxiety/depression, ever since I was a small child? It wasn't as bad when I was a kid (I guess) but I think it might've still been there. Well, particularly the anxiety and low self-esteem. I've always had kind of a low self-esteem and been a very anxious, timid kid. My parents hoped I would grow out of it, it was assumed I was just a naturally timid and shy child, but I guess not.

TL;DR I'm sick of feeling numb and having no motivation or passion for anything. I'm taking medication which helps a lot with my anxiety but doesn't seem to do much for my depression. I'm also seeing a talk therapist which helps but I don't know if it's working as well as it could be. I've been seeing this same therapist for years, and I'm wondering if it will ever get better? Will it always be this way? Will I always be depressed? Will I always have to take medication? I can't remember a life without depression or anxiety, I think I must've had them since I was five years old, basically as long as I can remember. SOS, I feel like I'm drowning."

I can understand your situation but life is hard and it will become harder if you give up. There are times where you are going to feel like shit, lose friends, loved ones and family. There are periods where you going to lose all your hope, the will to live, the will to interact with people, the will to go to work. There are times where you are going to make dumb mistakes like hurting your family or the person that you love, you are probably going to do drugs or drink alcohol even when you are not supposed to. But that doesn't mean you should give up on yourself, even if you don't have friends, family or a loved one, don't give up there is always hope for you, even if you can't fix the past you can always change the future, you can always find new friends, find someone you can love and start a family.

Wishing everyone Happy 2k21.

as always stay awesome!"

I recently waited for three months for an appointment to get the updated I’d only to be turned back because I didn’t bring the necessary documents. I didn’t need to do this for my renewal, but I guess I had to do it for this. Now I have to wait another month before I can meet with them again. I don’t know why I even bother. Who’s to say the next meeting won’t also end in failure like this one did. This has been the story of my life ever since I was born. I wish I could’ve convinced them to let me get my documents and return at a later time today, or at the very least just walk in and get rejected that way saving myself the three months waiting. I’ve had it with being myself. No matter what I do it will always end in failure and disappointment. I can’t wait till I’m dead.

I know they would help in the end, but that end seems so far away. I feel like I am resetting my life from scratch.

In short time, I've lost almost everything I valued and I haven't gained anything (besides some weight and bad habits). I feel more alone than ever before. I have nothing going on. I'm poor. I can't even get a therapist. I'm constantly tired. I drink almost every day. And I have now hope of anything better. No hope of finding a partner or achieving something important. All I have is endless, boring days. And even if I could get work, it would be just some bullshit that would just make even more depressed.

The year will change but none of my problems will be solved. I will still be alone. COVID just goes on and might even get worse despite vaccinations. 

I'm tired of trying to do anything. Everything is just now impossible. I'm thinking of ending it all. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know how much my suicide would hurt my parents and sister. I'm basically alive just because I hate if they feel pain. 

And the whole world is basically just shit. Humans are mostly scum. I'm also scum. I have violent thoughts and some days I just want to revenge this shit world. I'm falling into anger and despair. I can't stand it much longer.

I feel like I can't take another year. I want to kill myself. I want this all to end somehow. I have survived many hard times but this time it's different. At least before I had some hope."

All this had to happen during my final years at college which means I'm supposed to be busy. Couple that with the fact that most univs aren't  really ready for full online learning and lazy professors and it's a shitshow.

I wish things would just go back to normal... While vaccines are starting to roll out, the average loser in a 3rd world country like me probably wouldn't see it  until next 2022, and things wouldn't probably wouldn't be back to normal until 2023, and by then I would probably die from the virus or from  suicide.

I enjoy nothing, I want nothing, I am nothing. All that's left of my life is browsing the internet, getting drunk at night, and passing one more day until I die. I can already hear the cries of ""just find a hobby"", or ""go out and chat with random strangers"", there's nothing I'm good at, and everything I try ends in failure. The few things you could call hobbies I'm shit at and don't bring me more pain than pleasure. And any ""friends"" I've had tend to put me in some kind of jester category and quickly get rid of me when I stop being entertaining, so I've stopped bothering with friends. There's obviously nothing about me that's appealing to the opposite sex.

I'll never have a family, I'll never even have anyone who'll love me in a romantic sense, I'll never have friends who genuinely like me for who I am, I'll never have any hobby that I'm actually good at, and I'm at the point where nothing interests or motivates me. I've already dropped out of the workforce after realising I've been wasting my life working for a future that doesn't exist. There is nothing worthwhile about life, and humanity as a whole has few redeeming qualities. At the risk of sounding like an edgy teenager, fuck this world, there's nothing here.

Life is terrible, and I know there are people out there that have it worse, but that doesn't change the fact that life is still terrible, it just means it's even more terrible for those people."
knpoo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/knpoo4/my_doctor_diagnosed_me_with_depression/,My doctor diagnosed me with depression,5,3,1609420010.0,"As the title states, I’m not sure of what to expect, what to do. I never thought I was suffering from depression. I went to my doctor one day because I discovered my blood pressure was high while testing some equipment (I’m in the medical field) and it alarmed me especially since my diet has a side effect of lowering blood pressure. After a series of visits she started asking questions that were personal and she said I might have some stress in my life but depression on top of that and since that day I’ve noticed subtle things that I never have before. I’m not sure if it’s my mind wanting me to believe I’m depressed or if it’s things I’ve just missed before. My family left on vacation while I had to work and normally that’s fine they’ve done it before and I was okay but now I miss my brother, I started crying at the store one day because I saw a toy car and remembered when we were young and how I miss that a lot, being kids and watching him have the time of his life with a toy car or when I used to help him set up a pillow fort, now I help him set up a bank account or something. I start forgetting things that would normally make me happy. I went to several peoples houses as part of my job and they had dogs, I stopped to play with them and pet them but at the end of the day I forgot their names, what they look like and really any memory of them other than me playing with them. My blood pressure is through the roof and I generally just feel down all the time. It’s not a feeling of unhappiness because I’m very happy with my life, I have an amazing job, amazing family, I’m pretty well off financially. I know I’m happy but why do I feel like I’m depressed? Happiness and depression can’t exist together right? At this very moment I’m content with my life and couldn’t be happier but I have a feeling of maybe being bored even though there’s so much I can do. The only time I’m not feeling down or depressed is when I’m at work because it takes my mind off everything but as soon as my shift is over it all comes back. Not even being with my family does what being at work does. Anyways my doctor recommended me take an anti depressant, it’s an SSRI called Celexa which I am familiar with but I’m wondering if anyone else has taken this, how is it? I don’t want to be someone who I am not or depend on a pill, I’ve never studied the psychological aspect of medicine and figured input from others going through this could help. Anything, just a simple conversation could help. Thank you to anyone who responds."

I know I should probably seek counseling, and I fully intend to, but I am trying to self diagnose first. I also know a Google search will yield some answers, but I felt like letting this air out. It's a very, very lonely place to feel depressed when you're trying to maintain a facade together for everyone around you, and have been for decades.

At the most banal and superficial sense, I appear happy and successful. Good career, reasonably wealthy and debt free with an open path to semi-early retirement, with a wife and young child in a home in a nice neighborhood and a part time nanny to help. It could be PPD I suppose, but I haven't felt particularly ""happy"" for a long time, maybe ever. I just feel no love and affection for either of them - I think I used to feel what I could describe as love for my wife but I've just lost the joy completely in being with her, but I haven't outwardly shown that change. I have little to no emotion with my child, but because I generally have been able to do an incredible job masking my emotions, I play with my child all the time and cheerfully (outwardly) try to help out as much with the child-rearing as I can, while stifling any signs of apathy that I can. I feel nothing when I am with my child. No joy, yet no resentment either - it's just a job that I am trying my hardest to do well in.

I have loving extended family members that care for me and - again outwardly - I care for them. I drive them around (used to, of course - thanks COVID), run errands for them, buy them groceries in the midst of the pandemic etc. I think I would feel sadness for their sake if they passed away for sure, but I wouldn't feel that devastated if I never saw them again either. This honestly goes for my immediate family either - I would be very saddened for them if they were hurt or killed, but I don't know if I will really feel sad myself or miss them. Life will just go on.

Often times I do want to end myself, not because I'm particularly suffering, but because I just feel so little reward for what I am doing. So much of my life is just going through the motions of what I am supposed to do - work hard in school, get a good job, date a good girl, marry her and be a good husband, father a child and be a good parent. I experienced some feelings of happiness in the moment of all of these events, but little lasting joy. Of course, because it's an action I have to take meticulous planning to do, suicide is unlikely I ever go through with it. So much of my life was done and planned on focusing upon things I'm supposed to do, I have no idea how to really do something that I'm not supposed to, and that includes planning a suicide.

I have no real violent or malevolent tendencies and certainly derive no pleasure - mostly revulsion - to hurting other people. So, I am not really a danger to anyone but myself. I do not use drugs and rarely drink alcohol, and have never cheated on my wife.

I have some interests and hobbies, but nothing I would call a passion. They distract the mind and keep me entertained, but I rarely am too excited about doing them. The only thing I have ever felt really excited and hopeful for was traveling to a new place and immersing myself in a completely different environment, if only for a few days.

No one in my entire life knows this side of me. Even as I type and feel this, I face a mirror and am able to fake the most sincere looking smile and satisfaction.

I honestly do not know what next step to take. I think the feeling of numbness became particularly apparent that I have fewer distractions and just basically face my family all the time this year because of COVID - the need to fake it so often and all the time is wearing me down. If I had to choose a path for myself, I would probably elect to stay with my family and be the diligent husband, father and employee and live out the rest of my years. I would feel my existence though only serves its purpose for other people - and I mean no disrespect to actually charitable volunteers.

I don't know what I have or what I am. I will make an appointment early in the new year to find out, but I just wanted to type this out and see what kind of response I get. Perhaps there is someone else like me who feels this way?  Perhaps someone else has known someone that experiences depression (which I think this is) this way? As in, not an active sadness, but a real disconnect and deep underlying apathy for life.

Also, as if it wasn't obvious, this is a throwaway account, because like in real life, even on Reddit I maintain a sort of false persona where some friends know of my actual username. That account subscribes to a few subreddits discussing hobbies and interests of mine and I post frequently, but I consider them distractions more than actual passions.

Thanks for making it this far."

Depressed All My Life, running out of options.",8,1,1609409343.0,"I've been depressed my entire life. Last time I recalled, I tried to kill myself (or at the very least, harm myself) when I was five years old. This info I remember dearly and I can't get it out of my head. People say I say that I go online and I do it for attention. Which is fucking stupid because that is, by default, what the internet is used for. To connect. I never had a girlfriend and I never will. This became evident to me when I was in 6th-7th grade, when everyone in the class, excluding myself, had some sort of sexual contact. I'm fat, I am very aware that I'm on the autism spectrum and I have several mental disorders, such depression, anger issues. ADHD etc.. The only reason I haven't committed suicide is due to the fact that I believe that I'll find a way to fuck that up or I won't be able to do it painlessly. Nobody in my family loves or cares about me and due to my physical and mental health problems, I generally believe that I won't be a functional person in today's society. I'm currently taking medication for my depression, as well as seeing therapy but they just don't help. I 100% believe that if I committed or had someone suggest to me ways to do it painlessly, I'd do it."

Having said that, I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. This manifests itself in a cycle consisted of periods of productivity followed by periods of crippling depression, where much of the progress previously made is unraveled. Every time I find myself in the midst of a depressive episode I reach out to friends/therapists or develop new coping mechanisms to drag myself back to a semblance of normalcy. Within the last two years, however, I've found myself in a new country with many of my previous coping mechanisms now dismantled. The duration of my 'up' periods is gradually getting shorter and the effort to get out of my 'down' period is getting larger. As it gets more difficult to pick myself back up again, I've noticed my friends getting more and more distant. Finally, it's become too difficult for my friends to try to force me out of my depressive hole as I just fall right back in again. I feel like everyone is giving up on me and the darkness is closing in. I'm tired of trying over and over again only to find myself in the same place again, only with a darker back light. I will never be ok."

I do not know why my happiness/self worth has to be derived from others. I’m an only child, have a successful career, do dope stuff all across the US and the world (pre-covid) yet I can rarely ever be happy when I’m alone. Which is truly sad because I am alone a lot. 

I doubt many will read this. And those who do will likely not care. But I found myself in a familiar situation over the holidays. 

I have had a thing with this girl for a very long time. We get along great together. We seem to get one another. We laugh. We dance. We express our true selves to one another, blemishes and all. I have honestly ended other relationships with great women because they don’t do it like this one girl can. They don’t scratch that part of my brain I cannot itch. Alas, there is a problem. She is the sister of my best friend. 

We have been intermittently romantic/sexual numerous of times. And as the days fade away, she always just says she wants to remain friends. That the complexity of the situation scares her. To which I am understanding. I don’t want to jeopardize what I have with her brother. He is truly my best friend. So the situation is less than ideal. 

Routinely I just go on with my life, find another mountain to claim or girl to relieve my sorrows. But I think this time is different. Over Xmas we hooked up, again. We were both wildly intoxicated. In the moment it felt right, perfect. She had just told me a week prior she wanted to be friends. Come the morning after it was awkward. She was cold, distant. Then a day later she made it known again that Xmas was a mistake. That she wanted to remain only friends. I was/am devastated. 

This brings me back to how this time I think it’s different. I feel more sad than usual about the situation. I feel broken. I’m so sad. I’m ready to just give up on a relationship and remain content with only myself. I think she may be the one for me but if we cannot be together all others will not suffice. 

I am trying to look at the positives. She’s great and we can remain close, but maybe not as a couple. But I long for that. Though I do realize I could be just romanticizing the possibilities. She knows how I feel but my fear of driving her further away prevents me with speaking my whole truth. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. I hope things improve for me. And if you’re visiting this sub, I hope things improve for you too. Bye."

So we have New Year's Eve after a year of getting myself together again, I can even say that I'm quite happy thanks to a soulmate (you know who you are if you're reading this :). And then ""boom!"" - a person not directly responsible for subject trauma then but guilty of neglect (didn't do anything to help while fully aware what was happening) suddenly calls me up to wish me a fuckin happy new fuckin year and ask to meet and talk of ""good old times"".

Fuck it, I metaphorically killed the person that I was at the time (attempted it physically but now glad that it didn't work), why the fuck resurrect her?! They are not fuckin good old times, I got rid of any reminders of that time and changed my life completely. That person is fuckin dead and I want her to stay that way. I will not let them ruin my effort to get well just bec they suddenly felt nostalgic. I can talk about it, but not with someone who is responsible for those events!

I have dreams and things I want to do, places I’ve said I’ll go and a person I want to become. All of those are plans for the future but today I’ll be telling you who I am now. Im 20 years old graduated from high school with 2.3 GPA, I’ve spent the last 3 years of my life high and in total I’ve had to of spent around a 3rd of my life playing video games. And that’s all.

I feel guilty for making my father miss out on so many memories he should’ve had with his son because I was too busy playing with friends which meant booting up my Xbox 360 and getting on black ops. I’ve never been to a single high school dance. For fucks sake the last sport I’ve played was little league baseball; it makes me cry man, I’ve done so little with so much time. Wasted time. 

If I were to die right now. What would i remembered for I asked myself? It took some time to grasp the real answer and when I came across it, it hurt me. Nothing. That’s the answer to my simple question, it’s painful to realize that you mean nothing to the world. It’s more painful realizing you mean nothing to anybody besides your family of course, I’ve made zero meaningful connections and in reality you’d be lucky to find me in a store or restaurant cause I can’t cook and I only order food. 

Now. Now is the time I decide I’m changing things around, I have one meaningful connection, a buddy I’ve grown up with since the age of 4, we grew up into this sad lonesome person together. We’re deciding to grow out of it together, we’re planning to hike, get in shape, learn to cook, travel and go to concerts, meet new people and ultimately holding each other’s pc hostage while we reconnect with the world. I’m gonna be honest this is terrifying but I’m more terrified of being forgotten. 

(P.S.) All I hope for are sweet wishes and encouragement. I want to hear stories of people who have lived like I have and if you’ve gotten out of this rut please tell me what you feel like now and what gives you the most joy whether a career, hobby, family, etc. This is a quick short story I’ve wrote to express how I feel right now and hopefully to help others understand they are not alone so I’m sorry if it was poorly made, obviously I wasn’t a good student. I might try to update you guys if I continue to work on myself although maybe on another thread or something. I’m really not too sure as I’m unfamiliar with Reddit but I’m turning over a new leaf and wanted to express myself somewhere.

But when I wake up from sleeping I feel nauseous and don't want food or water, but im also a little hungry right now but nothing sounds good to eat. 

It could be the breakup I'm going through and its a usual wave of ""I miss him"" and stuff. Maybe it's the memory that was surpressed to protect me now open, wishing I didn't know the truth about me and my mother. The dread that in 5 months there will be another mother's day that I'll despise even more than the last. I can't relate to people. 

I feel empty, and almost lost. I feel like I plopped down on the floor again and stopped walking. I have a doctor's appointment today. But it's not enough. I actually don't know why I feel this way this time. Usually I do but I claim I don't because I don't want to face something horrible. But this time I feel like a broken woman. I had to deal with so much shit, and for what? My family doesn't know what I go through and I don't know how they'll see me if they knew every pain and hardship I went through. Would they brush me off? Say they've had worse? That life is like that? I do not want these answers from them, as they said that to my brother lots of times. They think of me as sheltered and spoiled to the point where things I experience are the first time like recently getting blisters on my feet and being worried about it. They laugh at the idea that a woman should treat herself as a pregnant woman the moment she's sexually active. You know, stuff like that. 

So much childhood sexual abuse. I can't believe that I've experienced this shit since I turned 18. But I hate the idea of therapy and medication. I thought that I can fix myself, maybe I can, but I do not have the methods, tools, and answers to heal this pain. I'm so stressed. I'm so stressed my body hurts. My neck and upper back feels so tense and strained, no matter what I do it's back to its tense form. My face feels blank. I feel helpless, but I am offered help so many times. 

Why do I brush off other commenters? Everytime someone say ""I'm sorry you've experienced this"" I just brush it off until I'm broken down again? Am I really okay? Why am I having a crisis and making this post when I might be normal again in a few hours? 

I can't sleep. So I might as well eat, drink hot chocolate or tea, attempt to work out (idk crap about that though) shower, probably find humorous videos. Maybe I haven't been meeting my needs. I don't know though."

To summarize: I lost my job and my grandfather died in the same week. I live in another country with my parents, so part of the money I got from work I sent it to my grandpa's funeral. The catch is that the family did almost nothing for him.

 His body stayed in the house alone for nearly 5 hours or so, they're too lazy to step up and find a doctor. They said the hospital was closed, but my brother there went to the other entrance and found a doctor; my family's too damn stupid to not look around the corner.

Only two uncles, a cousin and my brother were there to bury him because I don't know what in hell the rest of the family were doing. I know that a week later my grandma and aunts were all sharped dressed acting nothing happened at all, smiling and partying like it's sunday...

My anger was such that I assumed that they died for me. They can assume I was buried with my grandpa.  They used the cash I worked for (we're gonna talk about my job in a minute)  on themselves. It's been two weeks and I still don't know what's the name of the cementery he was buried.

I was a waiter, that also worked as cashier, that also worked as cleaner, that also worked as deliveryman and on top of that I was a translator between the boss and the kitchen. I was under a lot of stress and panic attacks were usual. The waiters know what's up. 

The thing is that I got fired in a week. I nearly made 80 dollars. I sent like 20 dollars for the funeral and I can swear that none of that money was used on him. The rest I used it to buy rum and help with the electricity bill. 

I feel like shit, especially because I risked a lot, risked my ass arriving at dangerous hours to get home, sleep and then go back to work and got some nice panic attacks for that job to be used for hair dye and nails. I consider myself someone positive but it's hard to see the good here.

I've never felt so loveless, so abandoned, lonely, desperate, needy and angry in my whole life. I can't even spend time doing stuff outside because has beem raining for two weeks straight and it seems it's gonna be like that for a long time. I can't go on my bike because of that, and the bike helped me so much

I just want to be truly loved... my mom and dad are aware of this monstrosity, my mom is on my side. My dad not so much, maybe he's not done processing this or something. My brother is far away, and I only have family friends that are like family, but still feels disconnected. 

I can't see how this is good, or how it can get better. And religion is a good joke to me, Jesus wouldn't even know what to do neither. I don't have that ability to feel loved just because someone told them to do so.

 I've been hurt for a while now that I've become a shell, a rock. Incapable of crying. Just expressing myself through words...

Sorry if this is way too much, but I'm tired of asking for help, because I don't even know how could I use some help"

Because of my situation I wasn’t able to do stuff like go to my dream college, go to concerts and sporting events, and not even hang out with friends much. I will admit I used my pain and physical health as a way to push people out, I gave up on many things because I found no point in them. I allowed my issues to destroy me mentally a lot of time and I am fault for that.

I saw a post the other day and it stated something like “I have lived the same day over and over since march”, it was meant to be a joke about the lockdown. As I read this it hit me that my life was not affected at all by the lockdown. In fact the way I live now is the same I have for the past 4 years. I have friends who I talk to every once in a while, and family, but I don’t actually have someone super close that I hang out with, and I don’t have a social life. Worst part of my realization was that it showed me that I have no goals. I have not arrived to achieve, or even really accomplished anything in the last 4 years. Ever day has just been about surviving for the next one, and doing the bare minimum. All I have done is wake up, survive, and go to sleep. 

I let my physical health finish me mentally, and now I’m in a position where I don’t know how to get out. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I don’t know what my next step should be, and a part of me doesn’t even care about this things anymore.

I’m a minor, so I have to do the little mental health surveys and admittedly, I usually put down that I’m A-OK, while that isn’t the case. And although I did say on the analysis that I’m feeling depressed, I still lied about my suicidal thoughts and how little I take care of myself. And since I lied about it my doctor just told my mother that I’m “feeling a little depressed due to the pandemic and all that” Which is definitely the understatement of the year, but again, I’m to blame for that. Despite wanting to tell my friends and family about this, I still just can’t bring myself to do it. I’m definitely not telling my doctor anytime soon, I just get way too anxious and I don’t have it in me to have a panic attack at my doctors office. I do want help, which is why I’m typing this, but I don’t know how to bring myself to actually do it. Frankly, I’m pretty embarrassed about it, and my mom definitely can’t afford to pay for a therapist and any more medications than she already does.

Never happens to me? I have no problems with hygiene or keeping the house clean, I do procrastinate tasks that I find distressing until the last minute but I still get them done and I've always done that. I do feel unmotivated most of the time but I do fine at both work and school. 

I noticed that I don't really do things for fun anymore and my mood is obviously not good, it changes between sadness, nothing and ""meh"", my thoughts and perception of myself and the world are so distorted that even I can sometimes see how they make no sense and I do feel like I want to erase myself from existence because that'd be easier than putting in the work to get my shit together, I just don't do it because I know that'd be shitty for the people who know me. Like I know they care about me but I can't understand why when I'm actually worthless.

Can't judge my eating and sleeping patterns too well, I'd say they're fine but my friend says I'm just being dumb because my reasoning is that I sleep through more nights than the ones where I wake up at 2am or can't sleep at all...That happens but not often enough for me to consider it a problem.

In the last few days I can't concentrate and forget just about everything that happens during the day, I have a hard time recalling what I've done even when I know I've been really doing things. I find that part kind of scary. 

But my issue with all of this is that I don't think it's constant or been going on long enough for an actual diagnoses? I guess I'm scared that I go there and get told that there's nothing wrong with me and then I'll have to somehow just solve this on my own. I'm seeing a psychologist usually but we're on a holiday break for a few weeks and all of this has escalated only in recent days, so the last time we talked I didn't bring it up. I'm seeing her for autogenic training so the sessions have a pretty much fixed schedule and sometimes I think it helped already with my anxiety and in making an conscious effort to not isolate myself from my friends, but when I have to practice on my own it just falls apart and it feels like I got anxiety swapped for depression. I don't know how to put in the work to help myself and I guess that's the real problem here. I know I need therapy because even if I get put on meds or something my issues won't just magically go away but I don't think I can be proactive enough to go after the help I need, if that makes sense.

Its been 1.5 years and still to this day it hurts and there is so much regret. I puke in the morning sometimes because of the pain. I cant eat and lost 50 pounds and now im anorexic. I drink for breakfast and its starting to take over my life.

Every time I try to talk to her she literally interrupts me to talk about herself or one of the boys she likes.  That's, and I'm not kidding, about 90% of what we talk about.  Is just her ex, or one of the boys she's talking to, or just about her dating life in general.  I don't talk about myself too terribly often and every time I have, it's literal interruption mid sentence to change the subject.  I know I'm bad at talking, and I'm boring and can't form sentences great, but I thought we were friends?  It's hard for me to blame her but it hurts a lot.  

I got her a few things for Christmas.  I didn't spend much I'll admit, but it was some nice things I already had for gifts.  Quite a few things, because she's my best friend.  She didn't get me anything.  

My other friend, I'm not even sure if we're friends.  I consider them to be my second best friend after Jennifer, but I'm pretty sure I'm just kinda 'there' for them.  I have a huge crush on them, but they've kinda friend zoned me, if even that.  

 I feel so fucking alone.  No one actually enjoys my company, no one actually likes me, no one can stand to be around me.  I chase everyone away.  I'm the most unlikable person I've ever met.  I want someone to like me the way I like them, love me the same way I love them.  How do I find that?  I have so much love to give."

What steps do I need to take before running away?,1,3,1609403178.0,"First off, I'm sorry if this page isn't the place for this. I've joined the site sort of just to ask this, and I don't know where to go. If there's another community I should go to, I'll post there.

I'll explain my situation. My mother and I are poor, and we always have been. I won't deny that a large part of this is due to the economy being in fucking shambles, but at least part of our poverty is due to my mom's various addictions. She's mostly sorted herself out now, but I spent much of my youth exposed to her drug habits. She still smokes both cigarettes and weed, and while I can sympathize, my frustration with the fact that this contributes to our financial situation is overwhelming.

Despite how poor we are, my mother absolutely insists on constantly moving and changing jobs. Over the course of my life, we have lived in over 20 different apartments, and made 4 moves that were more than 100 miles in length. Because of this, all of my friends are online. They've been a pillar for me in the lockdown, and helped keep me sane as my life rapidly went downhill.

In short, my mother has begun to use my name and identity in order to make more money for us, all while I've been neglected and parentified for upwards of 6 years. I've considered suicide multiple times. The situation I am in is severely unstable and staying here poses a very significant risk. I honestly can't put into words how awful it has been.

One of my online friends, who lives most of the way across the country, has offered to let me stay with her and her husband for a month and help me establish myself as an adult near where they live. I completely trust them, but I doubt my own ability to get things sorted out. Another one of my friends has offered to buy me a one-way plane ticket. 

I know I need to do a handful of things (get my driver's license, disconnect my bank account from my mother's, sort out my resume and try to secure a job), but I'm afraid I'm missing things. What can I do by the beginning of March to make my run away as safe as possible? How can I cut I make my own safety net when I cut my family off?"

This thought has almost driven me to suicide, I get up everyday and I instantly think about how much of a pedophile/pervert I am. I thought about going to therapy or going to the police for help but I freak out about this so much that it’s crazy. I can’t help but go back to it though, I have made measures to stop myself from watching it but then I go back and I end up looking for it even harder the next time.

I'm 23 years (i know im very young but the thought of even another year is pretty unbearable) old currently going through a divorce from my wife of 4 years and a relationship of 5 years met in highschool and the relationship was awful, co-dependent, toxic, and suffocating. I have finally accepted that it was necessary to end after a couple months of debilitating depression and suicidal thoughts now, but I'm back to square 1. I have been depressed for about as long as i can remember maybe young teens ( i grew up religious so that wasn't really an option to be depressed). The biggest issue i face and have on a daily basis is i dont give a fuck about anything that actually requires effort. I have a couple friends that mean a lot to me and family that is supportive and love me but you cant just talk to loved ones about being depressed and how life is pointless 24/7. I go to college online because i was in the Navy and got out because that really drove my depression through the roof so school felt like the reasonable thing to do. Honestly though i wouldn't care if someone came and gave me the degree right now to do the job i am studying for because what is going to be different? ill have money? sure i guess maybe even meet someone new? yeah well then what. 

It all just seems like life is a fucking game where we can see who can convince themselves that what they are doing is important and i just cant. I cant convince myself that that's worth anything or distract myself long enough to get through this. I guess the only thing that keeps me going is a little sliver of hope that maybe one day ill find ""it"" or just stop thinking so fucking much and analyzing about what the purpose or meaning of everything is.

I think I have realized that my main motivation or deterrent from completely giving up or suicided is this weird idea of how much can I actually take before it will truly all just snap. So the longer i live the more opportunity for suffering and pain and it almost seems like that's my purpose is to just endure life for just the sake of enduring. (I also want to clarify that I know that I have it so much less painful than many others who deal with depression or abusive family or terminal illness etc.) 

Well rant over. Sending love out there to all of you fucking fighting, this shit aint easy. Good luck."

It’s currently winter break for me, but it’ll end in a few days. I’ve done absolutely nothing these past few weeks, but I didn’t think anything of it until now. I had a great time calling friends everyday, playing games with them, etc, and I was really happy. I genuinely was. The last time I felt like this was a month ago; it was so nice, not feeling like a worthless waste of space.

I have a brother who is a super genius. He has won multiple prestigious awards for mathematics and physics, has flawless grades without studying, writes research papers, develops apps, and has endless career opportunities. My friends all know him because he went to my high school; he’s essentially a legend. And yet here I am. A worthless piece of shit. 

My grades are terrible, my work ethic is non-existent, I have no passions, I can’t force myself to do anything, I suck at socializing, I’m butt ugly, I understand nothing at school, and I’m a failure compared to my brother—or anyone, really. I’m irresponsible and can’t do anything by myself. My dad kept nagging me to do SAT practice this entire break, and I didn’t touch the book once. The PSAT I took last year I got a 1320 while every one of my friends and classmates that I know got well above a 1500. This doesn’t even matter. Idk why Im talking about this.

In general, I just feel... worthless. I feel like I’m wasting other people’s time. I feel like my brother deserves a much better sister than me. He’s better off without me. I’m imagining how, in the future, he’ll be famous for some discovery or invention, and I’ll taint his name when news headlines say his sister is dying and homeless. He’s so kind to me, too. He answers questions when I’m confused (he knows literally everything) and he makes me laugh. I don’t deserve him. I should be dead. I shouldn’t be allowed to have him. He shouldn’t deserve to have a sister like me.

My friends, too. I don’t deserve them. One of them bought me a drawing tablet for me to use instead of my phone. What did I do to deserve it? Whenever I see it, I feel guilty that she didn’t give it to someone else. When I talk to my parents, I feel guilty that they had to have a child like me. 

And the ironic thing about all of this is that, I keep saying everything would be better without me, but here I am. I’m too scared to do anything. I tell myself to disappear, yet I want to keep living. I’m afraid of death, yet I want to embrace it. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I don’t know what to study in college, what career I want, what my type is for a partner, what my hobbies are—I’m just so lost. My friends all have a career in their mind and a list of colleges to apply to. I have nothing. I don’t even have a clue. I just want to disappear but keep living at the same time. I hate myself. I hate how I can even do the littlest things right. 

Im just waiting for someone to kill me since I can’t do it myself. I just have to keep living like this until someone can kindly end me. I want to enjoy life, but it’s really hard when you’re a piece of shit like me.

I don’t know why I’m writing a whole fucking essay on reddit. I’m just lost. I just want to rant. I don’t expect anyone to read this. I just want to tell someone or put it out there. No, i’m not going to talk to my parents about this. They’ll think I’m crazy. No, I’m not going to talk to my friends about this. They won’t care anyway. And no, i’m not going to talk to my brother about this. I’m just going to make him worry and waste  his time. 

Thanks for reading if you did. It means a lot. :)"

And that’s what makes it hard, not that I’m sad or I wanna die but just the fact that all our stresses and fears are stupid, not just that but  our whole existence is such a small insignificant period in an insanely large time line. We’ll be here and gone before we know anything. I can strive my whole life to my successful and happy and on the off chance I do what then? I get to have the perfect family and be comfortable with my money? We have to give up our priceless time in order to make money. Something made by us that has divided us unlike anything else. Our emotions aren’t important at all. So why am I having these shitty emotions all the time when I’m significant. It pisses me the fuck off when I think about it, and sadly, it’s all I think about. I look at myself in the mirror and I see nothing. I look at what I own and I see nothing. I try to look in the future and picture myself and I can see nothing.

I don't feel happy or sad I just feel there. Sometimes I feel guilty about not being ""productive"" since I'm avoiding my homework, I'm not working on any skills, everyone at school is going to think I'm lazy and incapable. And maybe I am. But I just stay there and I don't move for hours on end. I hate it. I hate myself for ruining myself. 

I hate being female. I don't think I'm lgbtq but I know I don't like my gender. None of my feeble attempt at jokes catch on and I always get blamed for everything. People just tend to blame me for everything even though I don't understand how it's my fault. I've narrowed it down to my gender. The feeling just sucks. It only adds to the spiral of darkness I feel everyday.

Am I just acting depressed? Maybe I'm just an angsty teenager and Im pretending to feel bad. I don't deserve to say I feel bad then, but I don't think I am. Am I lying to myself?

This is my first year at high school and it sucks. Nobody wants to make friends with me because I'm an ugly girl who never says the right things to other people. Out of the people that do talk to me, they only like my attention and not me as an individual. I hate it. 

But what's the point. When I have good grades I still feel empty inside, when I hang out with my friends I feel lonely and distant. Because when I try to talk about how I really feel they don't understand and they don't really care. My family doesn't understand, and if I tell them how I feel I'd just get judged or yelled at. I'm posting this in desperate hope that someone, anyone relates to this. 

I don't think about suicide. If I die then I'd just be another burden on the people I know, but they will forget me. Carelessly making ""friends"" and forgetting them once I'm gone. Maybe it's better if they forget me anyways. 

Life just seems pointless, happiness seems impossible. It never lasts, all happiness is short term. Nothing really matters. My entire life is online because of the pandemic and I only feel more useless and aimless now. Everything seems so superficial and fake. All my friends are superficial, they don't care, they don't understand. My family would tell at me and punish me if I tell them. I feel so alone. The things that I used to like are becoming more bland and tiresome. 

Is there a cure? How do I earn happiness? What's the meaning of life?"

Has it always been here? Was I born with it? Has it always kept me from feeling close to the ones I love? 

Or did something stain me with bitterness? 

Was it the traumatic childhood that pushed me to obsessively run for success? Was it the fear of not being able to survive? Was it pounded into my body from the bruises, burns, and cuts? 

What is the purpose? What is the point?

Why does living matter so much when everything is so bitter? Why does the instinctual need to survive kick in at the very last moment? Why do we get pushed past the breaking point only to continue pretending like nothing ever happened?

I seriously suck at that, i got so frustrated because my friends are so good, they just play with me cause they are really good friends. I tried to practice by my own, I practice everyday, and what have I achieved? Absolutely nothing. 
Last month, I thought tennis would be good, doesn’t see tough. Guess what, i’m not good enough too. 

This frustration make me so mad, and so sad. My self esteem it’s underground, I really do my best, seems that doesn’t work. And I feel worse, because I used to be the best at certain things, and then, I suck in everything.

Yesterday at night out of nowhere i did dream with my ex girlfriend(She broke up with me 1 year ago) and when i was listening to the song i started think about her its very silly i know but when i was with her i was the most happiest person ever and when she broke up with me my world started to fall apart.

After that i did have hook ups with some girls but its not the same thing they are like drugs make me happy and forget about my ex for a brief period of time and then all of a sudden i start think about my ex and im back to square 1.

The trauma that i have is so big that i cant like anyone im rather being single than being with someone Im very afraid of doing always the right thing on the relationship and despite that the person leaves me.                                                                            

It's very stupid crying because of this but i did not have the best childhood(disfuncional famíliy,abuse and bullying at school,loneliness etc.) i need like water those things like hook up with girls,chilling with my friends,going to parties/raves(fuck you covid for taking away that),having good grades etc. to fill the void that i have inside me.            

Since i did go to university i became i much better person but its not good enough i have those moments that i feel im failing to be the best version of myself if i was a even better person my ex would still be with me,finish my course in 2021 instead of 2022(and my father is paying for my studies i simply cannot fail) and sometimes i feel that Im a burden to my friends.

bottom line being in this world its a constant struggle and sucks Yoyoing in being miserable/confident about myself(bipolarism?)."
knkdq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/knkdq0/abusive_relationships_and_depression/,Abusive relationships and depression,1,2,1609394805.0,"So I have been suicidal a few times in my life. Only once that was pretty bad, and that was a long time ago.

I have limited relationship experience as I've been with the same person (on and off) for about 17 years. That's a while. But any time those thoughts start sneaking in it's because the abuse finally starts to get to me.

I guess feeling like life isn't worth living because of the way someone treats you  is a red flag. I get that now, but I didn't for a long while. He's a narcissist who has no idea he's a narcissist and who devalues me as often as he can... he figures out what might trigger me and then goes full-force any chance he gets. He has a horrible self-esteem but won't admit it, maybe even to himself, I'm not sure because he never talks about how he feels. The gist of it is he doesn't like himself, feels inordinate amounts of shame and then takes it out on anyone he can including me and his staff. The only person that he won't devalue (though he's bullied a bit in the past, not anymore) is my daughter because that's where I've drawn a hard line. And the dog, who he was violent with a few times until I called him on it. I would leave him rather than have him hurt the dog again. 

So, I'm wondering. People who have endured narcissistic abuse, and/or been in an abusive relationship, did the depression ease up once you got out of it?

My guess is mine would. I've read a bit about situational depression. These are the things my partner does.:

\- invalidate any of my thoughts or feelings that don't line up with the idea he has of himself of being a perfect guy in every way

\- basically intimidates me any time I am not acting the way that he feels I should be

\- won't take any form of criticism

\- criticizes me

So, basically, devalues me often. Not all the time, but anytime that he feels threatened (which is often) then yah, it's the constant devaluation. I feel like shit.

I do think that I am currently suffering from SAD but he's awful.

Anyone feel depression lift once they left an abusive companion?"

knj7ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/knj7ka/post_graduate_depression/,Post graduate depression,16,6,1609390242.0,I graduated with my bachelors degree of sociology in late October through an online program. I’m a 21 year old male and was hoping to get a job with this degree and then go back for my masters because my home life isn’t the best. If not that route I would love to be a probation officer but all the civil service tests around me have been cancelled. I wouldn’t have mind worked as a case manager and or something related to social services but nothing around me is hiring because of COVID-19. I applied to a couple jobs out of state and haven’t gotten anything back. I have been going through a rough patch because I feel very lost and anxious about the future. I’m feeling hopeless and I know others have it worse than I do but this made me fall out of my workout routine and just routine in general and I’ve lost motivation. I was always a get it done now person and had the will to push through but just getting out of bed and going to work is so hard right now. I have very bad back acne scars and gynecomastia which is an enlargement of the breast and it has stopped me from being in relationships and with the job I was going to undergo surgery for gynecomastia surgery but I can’t afford it without the job and i really feel hopeless right now and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m just floating and time is just passing by right now and It just doesn’t feel real. Idk if anybody else has gone through post grad depression and if anyone has any tips would be very appreciated. I hope everybody has a good 2021!!

kniz3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kniz3b/im_so_tired_of_my_father/,I'm so tired of my father...,2,0,1609389355.0,"Living in brazil is not easy, but money can certainly pair things up to almost the same level if not above a first world country. What I mean about that is to have a job that pays all your expensives then some, my expensives are practically food, internet, rent and that's it. Here most jobs don't even cover half of that, even the smallest apartment in the shitiest city will be around the same pay as any shitty job.

Why I'm I saying this? Well I have lived my whole life with a pre-made destiny, born of a relatively wealthy business family, it was expected since the very day I was born I'll work and take the reins of the business. I never had a problem with that... I liked being in the company, what I didn't like is how my drunk father always mentally abussed me and my mother and sisters, it was never expected anything from me except utterly work on the business. 

Fast forwarding 25 years I finally got tired to the point of just wanting to move out even if it means losing my confortable lifestyle... So I talked to my dad on a serious talk alone while he's sober for the first time ever, with me taking the lead, I said my terms, if he wanted me to work hard on the business then I would need to move out of the house, he was very agreable even when I mentioned that I didn't wanted to work with him but with my older sister (who is the main business head), and strangely for me, the only other term he wanted is to never again not greet him when I see him, as I was doing, aparently that set him off terribly and he always went to rage on my mother...

For the next 3 years I've been living my dream, to the point where I droped the ball and stopped caring too much about work... There were the reasonable threats that my mother ocasionally told me that he was not happy with that, it was my fault and I fucked it up by being lazy... So about 4 months ago I started working hard again and even started having lunch with my family on time (I always skipped it and waited for everyone to leave), he aparently was so overjoyed by that that he gave me a very high salary raise. I imagined that it was over... All I had to do is keep doing what I was doing and that's it, good job, good money and I wouldn't have to deal with him...

Util tonight... he called me drunk for the first time in those 3 years to complain about something I did on work, I was really impatient and anxious over him calling in that state so I didn't want any arguing, I just accepted everything and rushed to him to say ""goodnight"", then when he did 5 minutes later another call... To give me ""ideas"" on how to work, I've been through what that means - is just his drunken rabble when he doesn't have anyone to talk to so he just spout nonsense. I rushed again to say goodnight and said ""no no lets not talk this late its all ok, lets do it tomorrow goodnight, goodnight!"" Then I hung up... He called 5 seconds later shouting on about ""never hung up on him again and don't ever come back to work"" even tho I tried to say I didn't do it on purpose, as I know that would only trigger him... Regardless, another call... This time on the same shit talk he gave me my whole godamn life ""I'm tired we gotta have fun and work togheter or I'm selling this whole shit and you all go to your stuff in life""...

It's been 3 years.... I'm tired already... I know deep down all he cares is that his only son stays always by his side even outside work, but I don't want his company... Does this sound bad? My whole life every single week shouting and breaking and booze... I don't even drink alcohol because of it as a promisse I made when I was only 7... I just want to work and not see him or at least not have to deal with him, even sober its ""His way or the highway"" and he let hell loose if its not his way...

Part of my posting this is just to let it out, but I'm curious about your opinions. I feel like there's no right way, trusting in the ""feeling"" of the moment is a dangerous thing, but that may be just a excuse not to leave the ""good life"" that I have, except on this moment I guess.... I'm a just a spoiled idiot? I don't want riches I want peace, but I know life is way rougher than I can imagine out there, if you live in a first world country and think its rough, try to imagine here... Or in any other third world place, exorbitant prices and meager pay...

Well, as my final tought, I will try to talk to him while he's sober up, I just can't let that pass or I risk this happening every week again, and I won't live like this.

TL:DR I have a decent wealthy family in a shitty country, but a shitty father always looming on me"

I don’t have the internship lined up and I’m extremely nervous about my last 3 classes. For some dumb reason I’ve saved the three hardest classes for last and I am taking a break winter quarter because this last fall quarter I thought about killing myself more seriously than I ever have before. I don’t think the break is necessarily wrong, but part of me thinks I’m just stalling. I’ve stacked the pressure on myself for this coming spring quarter.

The internship is stressing me out too. I don’t have anything lined up and I feel like I’m running out of time. Everywhere I’ve looked required a gpa of 3.0 or higher and my grades just aren’t there so I’ve never applied. I don’t have anything resembling an impressive accomplish to put on a resume or in a cover letter. I’ve worked part time at a car wash for the past two years and I have no experience in Cyber Security much less IT in general. 

I feel so fucking stupid, I don’t know anything that’s going on in my classes and my self care has tanked so bad this past year. I never really even wanted to go to college or study IT. I was pressured to go by my parents and I picked IT cause I spend most of my time playing video games or wasting time on my computer and I figured it seemed easy, but I really have no interest or idea at all about cyber security or IT or any of the complicated stuff. I didn’t really think it was gonna be hard at all, but I just have no drive to try. I want to quit and I want to die but I’m so close I feel like I’m letting down every single person in my life.

Whatever happens after school scares me to death and thinking about it immediately makes me want to kill myself."

I am pretty social, I mean I do t go outside too much, but because i like being alone, if I want i could go outside and have fun everyday, I do it sometimes, like every two months. And I really enjoy it.
I literally don't know a single person who hates me, the chicks I've dated have told me that they like how I can easily socialize and make people appreciate me.

I really like helping people, even if u are a stranger, I don't even know how social anxiety feels like.

I don't consider myself ugly, even i think I am a good looking man, and I always have some chick flirting me.


My problem is that I think that life is meaningless and just suffering, everything we want or we do, is to distract ourselves from suffering.

I just live my like feeling like it's passing time, I do things to distract myself about the fact that I live in this monotone and depressing reality.

I personally can say for the last few weeks I’ve been in the worst mental health state of my life and I spend most mornings in tears lol. I work full time and have continued to go to every shift and really stay responsible even though I’m exhausted and miserable. My birthday is January 5th and it’s always hard for me and every year I get the “next year will be good” I came to terms that my 20th would be me and two work friends and my fiancé and that was fine by me. For me that would be my best birthday. I said I’d start this next year at least on that good foot and we’d see, it wasn’t perfect but it was a small victory and I wanted to focus on the positive more. Today one coworker tested positive for covid. We’re a team of 9 and 5 people have been directly exposed so we’re out 6 people. I’m now working open to close with just the manager who harasses me for the next 10 days while they quarantine including my birthday. My few friends were those who got directly exposed so I can’t see them. Zoom just feels like a staff meeting and I’m just bummed. I know it shouldn’t be such a big thing but I seriously have had so many things happen this year I felt like I was at rock bottom. My guy and I have tried all the fun possible activities while trying to help our mental health’s so I’m seriously at a loss. I feel like this is such a big hit and I don’t know how to continue. Knowing that every day would just be the same and there wasn’t anything on the horizon that’s really that positive (we keep pushing vacation plans for safety).

I don't normally make posts like these. I only read others posts and give feedback accordingly, so this is kinda hard for me. Its just that every time I try to think of a future for me, I only kinda see myself in a grave. I've been fighting for so long, trying to keep my demons from getting to me. Even people don't seem to care about my emotions feelings as they do to others. Everyday in my life has always been cold. So cold that sometimes I can't even feel my body. I give everything it takes to make everyone happy but none do the same to me.

Home doesn't even feel like home to me anymore. My parents always say that I have to do as I'm told without hesitation. A small mistake in my household can amount to a month worth of persecution. I've only kept to myself because of this. Everybody's opinions and matters are always given attention and respect all the time. Mine is the total opposite. They say I don't have the right to complain because they do everything to sustain my education my health. I really don't understand how shallow my parents minds are. So they mean to say that I'm only alive because of Education and Food? That's kinda stupid. Heck, I don't even have the right to be angry in my house. Even if I'm out, people constantly judge me for who I am. What do they even know? Nothing. They only see what they want to see.

I don't know what to do at this point to be honest. Either I bleed myself to death, or just continue to be a living punching bag for the rest of my life. I'm so done with this world. I'm tired of this. If anybody reads this then thank you for doing so."

I'm 18 and have been struggling since 14 and nothings changed,4,2,1609386258.0,"I lost my grandpa who was essentially my second dad in january. My aunt has 3 months to live. My uncle died last night. I feel stupid because I feel so alone but at the same time I know I deserve it. I work a job I kinda hate for pay that isn't worth it. I've done nothing with my life and dont think I ever will. I'm a very physical attention type of person and I feel so starved for that it physically hurts. The only time I feel human is when I'm in pain. I just want to be numb all the time and I'm getting pretty good at forcing myself not to feel. I dont care about sexual things. Because of an ex who robbed me of my first time by manipulating me. I shut down when I see someone else upset and focus only on them. She was 36. I was 17. She started crying because I denied her advances. Her exact quote was ""you don't know how much it hurts for you to say no"" I shut down and wanted to only make her happy again. I didn't know what it was going to do to me I just knew I dont matter. I never have. All that matters is if they smile no matter how much it hurts me. I just want to cuddle. To have someone hold me and stroke my hair and tell me it's okay. But I dont deserve love. I'm not good enough. I never have been. I never will be. I'm forced to just sit here and suffer. It sounds awful but I'm jealous of my uncle to a degree. He got to go away. To pass on. Yet I'm still here in nothing but mental anguish so harsh it breeds and manifests  physical pain. It's awful of me to say but it's the truth. I'm envious of the dead. I want to join them. I know my death will be self inflicted. Its more a matter of when than if. I just hope I can crawl on long enough for my friends and family to learn to hate me so the pain for them is less."

I graduated college and got a good job in a pandemic, in the field I want to work in. I consider myself fairly smart and have skills that many people covet. I currently have no financial concerns whatsoever.

And yet I'm still depressed. Makes sense as I have no friends or love life. I'm lonely and it feels like I'm constantly putting on a mask. Even when I have seen ""friends"", it feels distant, same with family. Its exhausting pretending to be normal. I worry that my coworkers can tell I'm not normal.

At one point I had a small opiod habit and that was one of the only periods I was not depressed. Even when I wasn't high i felt so much purpose in getting the pills, it was like an adventure. I had no social anxiety or worries. I don't advocate drug use and ive since quit as it's not a safe path to go down."

He started me on prozac and referred me to a therapist. For whatever reason I CONSTANTLY worry that I don’t actually have depression and I’m just being dramatic and making my symptoms up and lying about them because other people actually have depression. It also makes me mad when people say that depression is common because it makes me feel like they are saying that a lot of people are going through what i’m going through, it’s not that bad. Does this make anyone else mad that people try to make it seem like everyone has depression when in reality it’s a small bit of people who actually suffer from it? I don’t even get why people say that it’s common and a lot of people have it when it’s only about 20% which isn’t a lot, and even less for men. I don’t even get why this makes me mad. Is it because I want to be special and I want to be a special kind of broken or something? Or is it because it’s true that depression isn’t as common as people try to make it seem because like I said, 20% isn’t a lot. I barely know anyone who has depression, not to mention a lot of people like to say they have depression when they really don’t. That also makes me so mad. People will say they are depressed or have depression when they don’t and will never know what it actually feels like but they like to pretend like they do. This makes me especially mad when my friends say it. My mom also likes to downplay mental illness. Moving on, I don’t feel like my medicine is working at all but I’m definitely feeling the side effects. I believe that it has made me dissociate more than often, more restless, maybe even more tired, and maybe a little numb but I don’t feel like it’s helping. Does this mean that it’s not right for me or does it just mean that I’m not on a high enough dose (i’ve been on it for over a month)? I’m also worried about my first therapy appointment.

Basically, the other day I told fellow depression sufferer that although there are many things I enjoy about life, such as the food, the laughter, the video games and Christmas and good movies and all that, I wouldn’t choose to do it over again. Everyone who I say this to is so shocked, and will usually respond with, “don’t say that! I wouldn’t go that far?” 

But I feel confused by the reaction. It’s not like I’m going to hurt myself or anything. I simply wish to do this all once and that’s it, (if given a choice) and that’s also why I’m not having kids, which they also never seem to understand. People around me are constantly encouraging me to have kids despite my stance and I tell them, “if I can’t find a good reason to be here, why should I be forcing someone else to try and find out?” At times I know it sounds dire, but really I’m a happy and goofy and optimistic person almost all the time, except when the show is over and reality turns the lights off for the night. On the inside I feel like there’s better things out there. Maybe in space, or in another world or dimension....but Earth and humanism is simply so bland and limited, I feel. I want to be a superhero somewhere else where there’s more color and possibility and the world is full of wonder and joy. I don’t want to simply pay mortgage and go to work or try and make money and avoid disaster forever, (even though I do enjoy my job and love my house.) there has to be something better elsewhere, is what I try to tell them. Despite this life being “meh”, I want “wow!” And I hope some day long into oblivion I find it <3 

I hope someone understands what i feel :)"

What’s the point of living if all you do is be sad and tell yourself lies like you will make a difference and you can be great all you have to do is believe in yourself. I won’t make a difference and I know people have to come to terms with that fact and just live because it feels good once an a while (living) but I can’t. That once and a while comes dulled and not often enough. I feel as if I have an obligation to live because my family would die if I died and I’ve always found it funny that people think that’s a good thing. Oh that depressed person won’t kill themselves because they told me they couldn’t do that to there family so they’ll work through it. But what they don’t realise that when that person gets down from that ledge or spits out them pills is the pain. Of everything, how hard that truly is. It is a form of torture that I cannot describe.and is it bad that when someone kills themselves I feel immensely sadness of course that it had to end that way but also relief that they were no longer being tortured. My leg is shaking. It’s quite a funny thing honestly you see I have these tics mainly from anxiety but sometimes when I get really bad it works as a sort of relief. I never say any personal feelings out loud, of course I say opinions and stuff of that sort but nothing of how I feel. I rarely show displays of anger or violence, I wouldn’t dare say stuff like this I’ve written allowed so my leg is the window to my soul. That’s why I always look in a room to see who’s leg is shaking and why. You can tell how intensely I’m feeling by the way I shake my led and when I’m really (feeling things??) I play with my hands and various other tics but I feel like I’m rambling now so bye. But first  can I say I never write what I intended to write about. This was meant to be about my struggles with not being or going to be helpful in any way towards society I mean and how what’s the point in living if all your living for is occasional happiness but here we are."

I was always close with my mother. Up to the age of 14, I would cry over advertisements/shows/movies that has some kind of mother sacrifices bs in it. I wrote a book full of poems for her. Then, I got into medical school for her. I got a scholarship for her. You would think she would be content with what I am and what I strive to be. But for the past few years, she has gaslighted me, threw me under the bus and took sides. Few months ago, I had a big fight with my elder brother who always went out disregarding the pandemic shit and I thought mom and dad would get infected one day because of him. It was a huge fight, my skin peeled off of my forehead. Few days after that, my mom said I was in the wrong and that I never took any traits after her which was unfortunate in her eyes. Not to mention, 2 years ago she said she regretted not bringing me up like other daughters. She referred this to me staying in my room all night instead of attending to my family and socializing. She constantly compared me with other daughters throughout the years and it broke my self-esteem day by day for 6 years. Today, New Year's Eve, they were supposed to visit my eldest brother and I told her 4 days prior I'm not going. Today, she told my dad and brother stuff that made them hate me. She said I haven't been trying to finish my work to make it and she said I have other plans in mind (inviting my relatives over). Both of which I know she knows aren't true. My dad told me to shut the fuck up when I tried to defend my own ass. Over the years, mom never let me hold her hand, and I cant remember the last time I felt her hands. I can't recall times she ask me how I'm doing apart from the times she picked me up from school when I was 10. She used to love me, wait for me, and smile at me. But now, I'm certain if I were to tell her I want to take my own life, she would tell me to not tell my family and just do it. I'm scared of hating her because I know I will regret it sooner when she's gone, but God, do I hate her for breaking me apart. She looks at me with hatred and she couldn't care less if I starved for days. I just want to kill myself to make her see that I do love her with all my fucking heart."

Anyway, even as I have struggled my way out of depression, my relationship with my family just has never fully recovered.

When I was at my lowest, they weren't great with me so I always kind of resented them. Now, it's just so hard to speak to them even if I'm feeling fine. I just don't know how to act myself when I'm around them, I just rather ignore them than show my true self . 

Don't really know why I'm doing this. Maybe is some kind of shame for who I was and feeling that if I'm joyful, it would feel a bit pretended to them.

I’m tired of people telling me that suicide is selfish, when the entire world around us is selfish. Just because someone superficially “needs” me in their life does not make me want to kill myself any less. I’m in pain and I desperately need help that I am not strong enough to get.

Why is it so hard for others to care?"

kngiti,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kngiti/i_honestly_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,I honestly don't know what to do anymore,2,0,1609380623.0,"I just need to vent somewhere, anywhere, and I can't even trust my own friends to give a damn about my own feelings or problems.

I'm just a broken mess of a person, it's been progressively harder to cope over the years and 2020 has only made things worse. I love my family very much. We're sadly a dysfunctional lot. I wish things were different, that I could be more independent and freely live away from my parents without having to worry.

I'm very well aware of the fact that both of my parents are depressed over their lives and financial situation. We're at a point where they just accept things and follow along to a monotonous, daily flow of things, if that makes sense. They tend to neglect their own health if i'm not around to remind them, they can't reliably do any form of self-maintenance and they've come to rely on my help on so many things. I know that if I move out and leave, it would break them and they really would waste away. My being there for them seems to give them some reason to live at least. It's not easy, I've had to shoulder their burdens too and my dad has done nothing but toss his responsibilities my way. I hate him for that and I hate what my parents have become but I honestly don't know what to do. They just seem to have mostly given up on trying at anything in life.

My father has been nothing short of a burden as well. He's a type 2 diabetic and until recently, has had it under control. I've tried to help him maintain his nutritional health, unfortunately he's a stubborn bastard and thwarts my attempts to the point where he's just so unhealthy now. Physically and mentally. I think what really broke me further was right before Christmas, he had to be admitted to the hospital for a variety of health issues he was dealing with. My mother and I found out that his kidneys failed, he nearly died if it wasn't for a blood transfusion and now he has to undergo 4 insulin shots daily and a dialysis treatment 3 times a week. No one else can help him, for reasons I won't go into, my mother especially hates the way he is and doesn't really want to have to deal with him. So it all falls onto me to help him. His legs are weak now and I have to help him walk. I have to monitor his eating habits and do shots for him myself. He can't even do too many strenuous motions without feeling tired or out of breath. And somehow I'm supposed to be there for him all the time. He's lucky that I'm on vacation atm, because normally I work 40 hours a week and come next week, i won't be able to help as much. I really do worry for him, and I worry at the fact that he's no longer physically capable of being independent to go to the hospital. This is unfortunately going to be for the rest of his life, unless he manages to get a kidney transplant which he's on the waiting list for. I can only hope he gets it soon. I'm really despairing at the fact that I'm becoming more of a caretaker than a son.

I'm just going off-tangent but I already have my own problems to deal with and my parents aren't doing me any favors. I already deal with self-confidence issues. I've grown weary of my job which is the only thing supporting me and my family (unfortunately they don't work anymore and savings are non-existent). I wish I could quit but for now it pays better than some of my alternatives. I don't even have aspirations outside of wanting to survive and live comfortably but that's not happening in my current state. I realize that I'm just like my parents, living the daily grind and going with the flow with no goal. And I hate that. I've had a few ideas on what I want to pursue for a career that would at least pay me a more livable wage and I know what I should do to get started for some of them but for some reason, I have this mental block where I just don't commit. I guess a part of me is afraid of change and the uncertainty that follows and that has resulted in my inaction. I hate this life, I hate how the only way I'm coping is wasting my time in unproductive ways like gaming, reading, and painting. Each day after dealing with daily bs, I just rinse and repeat these habits to try and forget it all and I'm so tired of it. I'm just so damn tired but also incredibly pissed at all of this. To make matters worse, my ""best"" friend who I've known for more than a decade doesn't give a shit, not even platitudes or sympathy when I tell him small details of the problems I'm facing. All he does is reply with a non-committal ""Oh"". It's ridiculous. 

Sorry if this post has gotten too long, I'm just going through a mental overload and I can't fucking focus on what the first step should be to get through all this and improve my situation. I just needed to let all this out somehow. Thanks."

Even the tiniest mistake or failure starts to fill my head with self loathing. I begin berating myself. ""Why do I suck at everything?"" ""Why am I so worthless?"" ""Why do I struggle to learn this?"" ""I can't do anything."" non stop. Anytime I try to do anything that is supposed to be fun I begin to lose it.

I tried getting back into guitar after stopping 5 years ago. Its been a bit over a year now and I fucking hate it. I can't stand picking the thing up for more than ten minutes. I struggle with it and then begin to get mad at myself because nothing sounds how I want it too. I feel like a constant failure. I think to myself its been over a year why does everything I do still sound like shit?

I can't even play competitive video games either because it always ends up the same way. I had to uninstall every competitive game I have because I can't do it anymore. I hate always feeling like I am worthless. All of my hobbies make me feel this way. I just want to enjoy something. I can't even have fun doing these things with other people because I still end up this way and they notice. I don't even play video games with my friends anymore.

I've figured out that this frustration deep down comes from the fact that I hate myself. Any sense of failure just makes me hate myself more. What am I supposed to do? I just want to enjoy something. I just want to have fun again. This doesn't even feel like living anymore. What is my life worth if I despise everything I do?"

I go and all that's done is giving me paper clothes that I can't hang myself with, get my blood drawn, and talk to a doctor via webcam. We decide that the best course of option is to release me because keeping me longer and making me miss work would make me even more suicidal because I'd fall behind on bills. I spend a total of about 2-3 hours there.

ONE YEAR LATER...

I get hounded by a bill collector and am informed of a $700 bill which by this point I managed to whittle down to $350 and am still working on.

I get hounded by another bill collector and informed of a $2000 bill for the same afternoon. At this point I'm furious and begin breaking things in my apartment. Because I can't recall anything done that day that warrants such a bill. I will definitely never go to the hospital again. I get hit by a car, I get the staples and duct tape. Catch the virus? Nyquil it is.

I'm so pissed I can't think straight, which could ironically lead to suicide! Life is a fucking joke and I figure I'll just treat it like that and ignore it for now. And if it ever escalates, I'll give them a personal visit and end up on a chyron on CNN."

Then something switched in me this year, I realised that by ending my life this horrible, awful pain that I feel will just be passed on to my parents and other family that love me. And I’m not willing to cause them to feel this hell I feel, so suddenly suicide is not an option

But, I still don’t want to be alive, I still live every day in awful internal pain, and now I feel lost because I don’t have that reassuring thought of “one day soon I can end this pain”... I just live day in day out wishing I weren’t here and not able to do anything about it. I used to self harm, I don’t do that now either. I do not know how to cope with these feelings

I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried medication... I don’t know how to live

I’m currently eating food not because I’m hungry, but because Im trying to feel something and fill the void. What’s the point? It got me thinking, and Ive realized how life for me is usually just a cycle between the varying shades of depression. It’s hard to pinpoint what “normal” is exactly. I mean, I’m able to get out of bed and do tasks, but am I supposed to feel like it has any purpose? I guess that’s a step above staying in bed all day and bawling my eyes out over nothing... or is it? Then there’s the periods of depression where I feel completely bitter and irritable over nothing. To the point where I push people away.  

I’ve also recently been diagnosed bipolar/ had a manic episode, and think that episode is the only time I felt like things were truly purposeful for an extended period of time. It’s made me realize how life truly sucks for me unless I have an escape, whether that be mania or alcohol or whatever. Can I just be mentally stable?

I feel insecure about my weight. I'm recovering from anorexia and gaining weight to get to BMI 19.4 My bmi is currently 17.5-18 but i still look in between skinny and chubby, not ""skinny"" and I feel so insecure and want to stay skinny as I physically recover from anorexia. I'm naturaly overweight endomorph and always been on the heavier side and it scares me.

I go through phases of being really confident and phases of being really insecure. And for a while I've really struggled with my identity and my tastes come and go and I just dont know who the fuck i am I completely lack a sense of self.

I dont give a shit about what you say like ""mbti/william sheldon's somatotypes are unscientific bullshit"" or ""health at every size, gain weight but love your body and accept your natural curves"" it only makes me more insecure.

Ironically, the more self-talk I try, the more insecure I feel. The so-called “thin ideal” doesn’t just apply to females. As a young white male, skinny = smart INTP Mensa nihilist stoner gifted child burnout soft boy genius but chubby = ignorant, immature, vulnerable, contemptible sheltered kid who appears annoyingly jolly but is actually severely depressed. Of course a clever person can still be fat. My dad drank a lot of beer and was pretty big, but my family told me he had an IQ of 147 and knew how to solve a Rubik’s cube and everything. The idea you have in your mind is only some vague stereotype. But body image is very personal. The skinnier I get, the more intelligent and in control I feel of what I eat. I don’t know EXACTLY why I love being skinny and i love being smart, but in some weird way it just influences my self-esteem and therefore mood in a deep-seated, detrimental way. I think it may link in with my identity crisis, as a teenage childhood abuse survivor trying to find myself and identify what role I play in human society. Despite the idea of the gifted child burnout or “doomer” being depressed, I paradoxically feel the happiest that way because it’s my “identity” so gives me much higher self-esteem.

I tell myself that the eating disorder team is urging me to eat more and move less so I gain weight to be healthy. I have to get to 54 kg, but I don’t want to weigh any more than that because a BMI over 20 is too fat."

These holidays have been the worse i have ever had! My mom and dad had a huge fight on Christmas Eve because my dad does give my mom the worth she deserves and he's always on his phone or computer, working, which is the same to never being present. Oh and when we do confront him (me and my mom) he always denyies it saying ""Bullshit! I'm home! What do you want me to do?"" And to my mom ""that is not true i support you every time"" deny deny deny

So today they had an argument, again, bc my mom said that he never helps w the house chores, like putting on the table for dinner, it may sound stupid but believe me it's fucking annoying. While I'm going back and forth putting shit on the table he's sitting on the couch watching tv! 

Anyways the argument was pretty bad, again, and grew pretty quickly. Then i was trynna explain calmly my mom's point which was nothing to offend him but he took the wrong way like he always does, and he started saying ""You don't have a say in this! Your opinion DOESN'T MATTER! It's always the same as your mother! You are ALWAYS defending her!"" And ofc I was completely shocked and hurt by what I was hearing so i snapped i said that it is not fair for him to say that because I have a mouth and a brain of my own I do not need someone else to speak for me! My opinion is as much valued as any fucking one on this whole god damn planet. 

I'm getting really fucking tired of ppl thinking that i don't speak for myself i have to always be defending smn or speaking for smn else other then myself!

sometimes i think so much about just killing myself, its not like there's someone waiting for me anyways, cause even if i try as hard as i can...its not like someone will love me anyways...i just keep imagining how my life would be if someone did

it'd be amazing...i'd have someone to go on dates or just, wherever, someone to play videogames with, watch movies, cuddle, buy gifts to, make plans with, maybe even someone to have a future together...i'd try to be the best boyfriend i can be...i just wish i was enough for someone...

i wish i knew how everyone else does it...even my friends found someone this year...i wish i was enough too"

At my best once every 2-3 days. I'm an emotional eater and not at all active. I'm about 400 pounds. Sometimes I don't take my pills, but 99% of the time I do, but it can be late in the day. If I'm out of refills, I'll procrastinate making an appointment with my doctor. I'll procrastinate making any phone call, or something I'm supposed to do. I've been staying up really late due to insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Then I sleep in until the evening. I don't really do anything throughout the day, I have hobbies, but don't really do them. I just waste day after day away on YouTube.

 I'm on social assistance (welfare) but probably could be eligible for disability. I'm not ready to make that call though, because it feels like I'll be signing my future and potential away. I'm very intelligent: was an excellent student getting honors despite missing about 60 days a year and never study. I graduated with adult high school, taking the easy way out as I was 19 and you didn't need as many credits. It's been roughly 5 years since then, and I have maybe 6 months of overall job experience through 4 jobs. I'm definitely concerned about going back to school as my mental state could barely take primary, and even the workplace is unbearable. Plus the thousands of dollars of debt I'd be putting on the line.

 I sometimes self harm, usually with my own fists rather than using a tool or anything sharp. I do occasionally bash my head against walls, or punch them. I've been dealing with this for almost 10 years now, and the only real reason I think I'm still alive is due to my faith. I grew up in a Christian household, and still call myself one now. It's a sin to take one's life, but it's also a sin to do other things I've been doing to myself. I love my friends and family very much, they're really important to me. At the same time though I always feel very lonely.

 I'm just so lost and have no idea what to do with myself. I'm thinking about going to Bible College, but I'm even afraid of that. Going to Church weekly definitely helps perk me up, but it doesn't last long. God and his Word definitely make me happy, and people tell me they see a glow in me when discussing it. The glow I used to have as the bright young kid I used to be before all this. Put simply, I'm scared of the world and all the dangerous unknown in it. Doesn't even really matter how trifle a thing it is, I get so caught up thinking and worrying that I soon become bedridden with a panic attack. Lastly, I'm so very ashamed for being this way, and it's why I hate myself so."

I have never had good self-esteem and that is a problem. I have a form of high functioning autism call Aspergers Syndrome.  I’m not ashamed of it, it is a blessing and a curse. I am not bound by the same social norms as other people are. I am uniquely myself and I think that’s great, maybe. I am always polite unless of course I am given a reason not to be. My biggest struggle I think is that I don’t think much of myself at all. I don’t think I’m worth much to be honest. I put on a brave face and everyone thinks I’m always happy and that I’m gonna okay. It’s just a mask but it’s one that I have to wear to make everyone happy. I’m the person everyone comes to because I’ll always be honest and do my best to help, I’m expected to be okay but sometimes I’m just not and that’s not fair for them. So I put on my mask and put what hurts in a box and then I forget where I put the box after so it sits an collects dust. I’m always afraid that people will see me as I see myself. Damaged. I love my condition and I also don’t. People never guess that I’m on the spectrum but I’m always scared that they’ll see it. I love all of my friends and they have never given me a reason to think it but I always feel like I’m bothering them just by existing. I feel like I bother everyone just by breathing. I don’t think that’s normal. I do have a boyfriend that I love so, so much but I almost pity him for choosing to be with me. He could do so much better. I’m terrible at helping as far as mental health goes because I’m terrible with emotions and I know that hurts him which in turn hurts me all the more because it’s my fault. I feel like I’m infected, like I taint everything I touch sometimes and that really hurts. I’m so sorry I’ve rambled so long, it’s just been a hard day as far I go.

I just need someone to talk to and you guys seem like you could listen to a short ramble from an empty individual :),98,19,1609365931.0,"  

Numbness is a fickle thing. 

I feel numb. I feel highs. I feel lows. I….I don’t know what or even if I feel. It scares me you know, nothingness, because I find it in a way slightly attractive. It’s an excuse to put in as little effort into the world as possible. Other people can decide where we go or what we eat or who we see. My brain and body don’t have the energy to consider such things. I spend a lot of my time alone. A lot of time in my own head and as of yet, I am no closer to taming my constant stream of thoughts than I think I ever will be.

I think I come across as fine, sometimes even confident and there’s time’s when I truly am. But they are few and far between now. Current circumstances don’t help the situation do they? So I suppose I shouldn’t be as hard on myself as none of what’s going on is in my control. But ultimately, my mind will be my corruption in this world. I fail to be present and am of the belief I will continue to do so until I pass on. Most of the time I feel like an observer rather than a participant. The comfort of loneliness is a denial of life. A denial of expression and denial of growth. How can a plant grow without sun and water? How can I grow without family, real friends, or even just a purpose? Sun and water to a plant is love and attention to man and I’m afraid, my friend, that I do not consider my mind capable of accepting either.

Maybe I’m genuinely just weak minded. Take things to heart too much. Think too much. Or, as I’ve had made very clearly to me on several occasions, don’t take anything to heart at all. Can’t win, can you? Spending so long in your own head can make or break a man and I’m on the path to needing some real maintenance in the future. I have grand thoughts of life consisting of big questions, big ambitions, in depth conversations that leave you questioning things even more, yet my failure to realise I am living in the present has stopped me from pursuing such thoughts. The consistent waves of heaviness on my heart are now a comforting feeling as I no longer feel anything else. I cannot explain what I mean by ‘heaviness of my heart’, just know that I am yearning for purpose, meaning and attention and I can physically feel the lack of all three in my body.

I cannot stop my mind from talking to me. It will be the death of me one day and I often consider the possibility if could use my thoughts for good and sometimes I do. Generally speaking, I am a goal oriented person and would consider myself someone who does something when I say I will. You want to know why? Because the thought of being the person who does nothing makes my heart feel like it’s eating itself, like a cancer to a healthy cell. Like I will waste my life watching TV and conforming to other peoples idea of who I should be. I genuinely feel heaviness in my heart when I consider just how fucking lonely I am. I’m not suicidal if you’re getting that “vibe” as they say. I just fail to feel. 

There were times in my childhood where I was subject to what many would consider extreme trauma. Things I think should be talked about with a professional. Things my parents have never addressed. But since childhood, I’ve not really had anyone in my life until my current long term partner. Their life was almost perfect from my understanding so I do not want or ask them to even consider what my life and mind were like but they try, and I thank them wholeheartedly for trying. No one else can or does. You kind of just, get on with it and try not to let the cracks show. I genuinely fear that one day I will have lost sight of who I am and I can see that happening already. A man without purpose is a life unneeded and I sure as hell lack any sort of purpose right now. I am a vessel for others to fulfil their life and I may just have to accept that I always will be.

An apology is due if this was a complete rant. You start with one aim then your mind flies at a millions miles an hour, you know how it is! I guess I have little of actual substance to say to be honest. After a while, you even start to lose the energy in trying to explain why you are tired and I think we are all tired right about now.

A hollow man will sacrifice himself on the path to fullness if it means saving another from feeling as they do. Many would consider this an act of emotion on the highest level but the failure to feel allows you to see where others feel they fail. Maybe, just maybe, that can be my purpose in life someday. Helping others, like you.

Love,

Me :)"

I hate basically everything about myself. And I don't know how to stop.

I hate the way I look. I'm called skinny, lanky, ugly etc, but then sometimes people call me cute and my parents and their friends seem to think im handsome. So for years i probably went around with an overinflated ego thinking girls would just drop to their knees in front of me. I started to question this when no girls ever expressed any attraction in me. To date, I've only had one girlfriend and it didn't last more than maybe 6 weeks. Another girl asked mt out; i had admitted to her i liked hern me, but she was like 12, a couple  months off 13, and I got the impression she was only interested in me doing sexual things to her which I said no to (this was before i had a gf). This makes me feel terrible for admitting I foudn her attractive. I had to think about it when she asked me, because im so fucking lonely!  I look at other guys and they have great bodies, they have girls and sex and sh\*t. i'm nearly 18 and i've got nothing. i've got a loving family, which is great, but then my parents treat me like a child and have constant control over the things i buy, what i post online, when i go out where etc. 

I hate the way I act. I'm socially awkward. I used to act ""myself"", but I didn't like that so I tried to act more like others my age, but not cloning them etc. then i got called out for being someone fake or whatever. Either way, no one seemed to like me. I have ASD and I sometimes struggle to get stuff, I can varely make conversations, im usually hte last one ot understand a joke or i'm the butt of it.

I hate the way I feel. I feel pathetic. I am. Everytime I try and change who I am, I fail. I hate the person I was before, and i don't know what i think of this new person. I'm a joke."

Yesterday I walked to my bike and discovered I had a flat tire. I immediately panicked. This bike is besides public transport the only way to get to my job and to the train station to see my boyfriend (I live by myself). Because of my autism I don't like public transport but most of all, I don't like change. So not having my bike scared me, more than I'd like. My roommate was so kind to offer to take a look at it today and she managed to fix it so I could go to work without having to use public transport and without having to take a bus to the train station. When I was on my way to work I realized that all that worry was for nothing. Even if my roommate wasn't able to fix it, it would still be okay because there is always a way. And this gave me hope. That eventually everything would be alright, no matter what it is. As someone who is depressed and has major anxiety this gave me hope. For life, and for all my worries. I wanted to share this because I think we all should remind ourselves more that everything will be okay. Even if something feels unfixable, it will all be all right."

So here it is. I'm a writer by nature and don't know how to be concise, so forgive me for this being long. The TLDR is that my ex-best friend stole a ton of money and probably some very sentimentally valuable items from my apartment, some of which were very monetarily valuable and others not so much, and now I'm struggling to cope. 

I have trust issues, and have for a long time, but have been working through them rather successfully with BH. They consist of being incapable of being vulnerable with people, and when I do trust them, I apparently trust them way to much and don't know how to limit that. There's someone I've known for years- my best friend. She fell into hard times and made some not so great choices during COVID, but she definitely wasn't alone in that and I wasn't all that worried about it because she was honest about it with me every step of the way, and never put me in danger or in situations I was uncomfortable with. I trusted her about as much as I can trust anyone. I travel quite a bit for work, and have often paid her to house/ dog sit for me, and we've never had any issues... until now. 

Back in October, I was pretty sick. I was getting migraines and had a cough and was all around not great. She came into town to do me a big favor and because I couldn't go out in the sunlight (thank you, light sensitivity) I gave her my card to go get payment. It's not something that was a rare occurrence, it's something I'd done a few times when she went to get food or whatever, but again, there was never any issues. We don't have any gas stations \*that\* close to my house, so she had to go across town and she had a family emergency, and wanted to go right away. I told her to just hold onto it and return it the next time she was in town (it was not for my main use account, so I didn't need it back right away, and I was supposed to see her again in a relatively short amount of time anyway). 

Well, I went out of state for a few days. When I get back, I notice some strange withdrawals totaling a pretty big chunk of change on the savings account linked to that card while I was gone. At this point, she denies involvement, and I have no reason to doubt her, so I open a report with both the bank and the local police. Bank won't refund since I willingly gave someone else the card (okay, whatever, I get it but it sucks) and they were in possession of it at the time. Another month passes, and I leave the state for work for a month, leaving friend to house/ dog sit since I don't want to leave him at the boarders for that long. 

Dog starts having seizures while I'm gone, and I wire some to cover vet bills, and she promises to save receipts and documents for me to review when I get home. This and the above withdrawals almost completely deplete my savings. I didn't look too hard at the vet situation because, again, I trusted this person, and I was working too much and such odd hours that it wasn't really feasible for me to be able to keep track of it and be calling the vet to check in and whatnot. I get a call from my detective that they got the footage back from the ATMs, and she goes to my house to visit my friend, then confirms to me that said friend is also the person on the video tapes. I get angry, but don't say anything to her for various reasons; mostly I just needed someone to care for my dog the last week I was gone, especially because I was so worried about him, and I didn't want to put that responsibility on my partner since his situation would make caring for my dog while I'm gone somewhat undesirable, nor do I have money to board him for that last week. 

She texts me a few days before I'm set to come home, dog had another seizure and she was taking him to the vet again. I didn't have the money to send, and asked her to give me the clinic and whatnot so I could call them. I can't call them, because she said the dog was hers- okay, I have his license paperwork that I can fax and explain the situation, so that's not a problem. She gives me a vet's name and a ""direct line"" to call the vet's cell, but I ask for the clinic name because I'm naturally suspicious of her now, due to, well, everything. At this point, she calls me and admits that there were never any seizures, dog hasn't been to the vet, and there is no clinic name to call because he was never at a clinic. I should have verified earlier on, but I didn't- I was exhausted and busy and worried and homesick and my rational brain wasn't working. She knew this and took advantage of it. 

At this point, now ex-friend has taken upwards of 5 grand from me. I was hurting, financially and emotionally. She had hit me at my weakest, most vulnerable point- my dog, who functions as my companion animal. Cue the vulnerability walls that try get thrown back up and I start regressing, but CBT teaches me how to not generalize and I do a decent job of battling it. Anyway, I tell her to get out of my house, and I'd figure something out for doggo. I call my partner, hysterical, and he goes to pick up my dog for the last few days. I hated putting that on him, but it was a last resort and he offered and did it without hesitation. He's a fantastic support through all of this disaster. 

I get home and pick up my dog, relieved that he's okay and to have him back and be home and everything else is secondary in my mind, something I can deal with. At this point, I haven't called the detective about the additional nefarious activities because it didn't seem worth it- she's already up for at least one felony and I'll never see the money again anyway, so at that point it's just a loss I'll have to write off and cope with, and I can handle that, along with the grief process of losing my friend this way. It's rough, and I'm already battling depression, but at this point I'll be okay. 

I clean the house from top to bottom, because I've been extremely violated and cleaning is what I do when I'm stressed; it's borderline compulsive behaviour but it's not self-destructive since I started using gloves when I bleach everything - including the ceiling - so it's a generally safe, productive coping mechanism. I do everything I can to stay busy so I'm not focusing on the stuff getting me down. I start my christmas baking and my family gets here and we have a nice christmas and everything is okay. I'm looking for my spinning wheel for my grandmother to borrow when she's here, but I can't find it and decide it's probably in the closet blocked by the bed in the spare room, and I don't want to shuffle everything around in there to get to it, and she's okay using my spare that I have access to (which is not my fav or the ""better"" one, but it's still okay; yes, I have two spinning wheels, another productive coping mechanism I have). 

Family leaves today, and I look in back closet. No spinning wheel. I clean out everything from under my bed and all the closets and everywhere, and it's just gone. In the midst of looking, I find that several other highish-ticket items are also missing, including my video camera and my telescope. My telescope isn't particularly great or even monetarily worth that much anymore because it's old, but it definitely hit me the hardest. I don't have a great relationship with my father, and never have, but it was the one gift he gave me that ever showed me he truly cared or had an interest in the things I enjoy. It was the only thing he ever gave me that had any meaning to me. I'm not a very materialistic person, the spinning wheel and video camera I could've gotten over and was still semi-functional after finding missing. But when I realized that was gone, I was basically a rocking ball of tears and audible sobbing the way I used to get when I was a kid and couldn't handle a situation, because it was all I could do. 

I felt like I was going to be sick. I still feel like I'm going to be sick. House-sitter denies it was her, and I can't decide whether or not to believe her because while she'd done really shitty things, this would have just been... really low. Beneath her, I would like to believe. She knew how much I relied on my wheel and how much my telescope meant to me, and had she looked it up to see what it was worth, it wouldn't have been worth causing me this amount of pain. All I can do is ask the other person that was here off and on while I was gone (that I know of, though I can't be sure), who I helped out and gave a roof and food and clothes a while back when he had nobody and nowhere to go, if he was involved. I hate to think he had any involvement, but I wouldn't put it past anyone right now. He also denies it, and I would love to believe him, but I'm finding it difficult to believe anyone. I don't know who to believe, or who to trust. I'm questioning my ability to pick people, and wanting to push everyone around me far, far away. It's all I can do to keep contact with the most important people in my life.

So I'm sitting here, in silence, wondering how to even begin coping with this. I haven't self harmed in over 8 years, but I also haven't felt this much internal pain with no visible way out in almost as long, and been completely alone in an empty apartment where my space and person have been so violated. It sounds more friendly right now than it has in forever, though I don't think I'm in much danger of actually doing it. The temporary relief, however much it would bring, does not seem worth giving up my 8 years, at least it doesn't feel like it right now. But I can't even clean, because the energy is non-existent. Picking up a broom is an effort of moving mountains. I have therapy tomorrow morning, so I guess there was some great timing on my part in finding all of this out. I need to call the detective to find out how to add all of this to the list, starting with what went down with my dog, but I don't know how or where to start, and I don't want to break down again today. 

The depression is setting in, and while I would like to fight it, I can't bring myself to do so. I have people I can call, but the effort in verbally explaining all this to someone is too much. I get non-verbal when I'm stressed anyway, and especially at this moment in time when I don't know how to verbalize what I'm feeling. I'm far more expressive in written words than by voice. Hence, I'm a writer. I'm just... lost. Hurt. Angry. Sad. All of the things. Too much to feel, so right now it's easier for me to cut it off and not feel them. Hence, apathy. I'll have to deal with it eventually, just not right this minute."

I have no more hope for humanity. Humans are evil disgusting creatures that seem to care only for their own twisted desires. Even as an adult I can’t escape that, I’d have to completely cut myself off from all other humans to accomplish some sense of peace, and even when I think I’m entirely safe I’m not. Every day its a new headline. Even if I’m not on the verge of drinking myself to death every day more and more I see how people treat each other, or how little they actually care for anyone else’s feelings or lives, or how desensitized everyone in the world has gotten to suffering to the point where I’m told to just shrug off everything. I saw a man make a rape joke in front of his girlfriend who looked about to cry. I saw people posting videos of a man blowing his head off and making jokes about it. Any time I see a firework video it’s all about triggering vets. How far humanity has fallen that no one has empathy and instead chooses to defend the monsters. I can’t vocalize my struggle because apparently that’d just make me weak or something.

 I’m trying not to go into detail here. But I just can’t do it anymore. I wish I could slip away peacefully in my sleep because I’m too much of a coward to do anything right now. Not that it matters. I’ll be gone soon one way or another."

You know, i I have the impression of having taken 10 years to climb on the first step of human society, to have a heart attack there and to try not to fall back on the floor.

That's what I am now, A Mission, and that fills the void of an orphan mind.

I see others seeking pleasure, personal success, money... As if their souls were crushed under a blanket of fear or just pure unconsciousness, but who am I to judge? I prefer not to judge. Just to know my mission is enough to be ok with my gosts. A mental movie that goes beyond the Self.

About 2 years ago I was given 200mg of Seroquel to take every night by my psychiatrist. At the time I was very suicidal, had been extremely depressed for years, and just accepted what ever I could to help me. I'm not entirely sure how this medication has effected me as my growth as a person was slow and steady over these 2 years. One thing I know for sure is it helped with my mild insomnia as it knocks me out an hour after I take it.

I have found myself in an immensely better place by learning to forgive myself for my past. My coping mechanisms are way better and what used to break me down for weeks or months takes me only days to get over and the emotions I feel are just what I would assume non depressed people feel. I have an amazing group of friends, rekindled my relationship with my family, and am exercising and going to the gym.

Ok so after all that my main question for you guys is whether or not it's ok for me to stop my medication with the help of my doctor or whoever I should talk to? I assume my medication helped me reach this place mentally but at the same time I feel 10 times stronger than I did in the past and a lot of it feels like it's who I've become with or without the medication. I feel I am ready to stop as I would like to not have to rely on any medication and find my happiness from within now. If anyone could share their personal experiences or thoughts into this I'd love to hear it!

TL;DR - Been on Seroquel which is an antipsychotic for 2 years. After much personal growth I feel ready to wean off of it. Is this alright to do? I would be consulting my doctor to do so safely. I believe I have found happiness because of my efforts to change and no longer need a medication to feel happy. If anyone could share their own experiences or thoughts I would very much appreciate it!"

I have pretty much always been a loner. This many years of going through life mostly alone has stagnated my growth as a person. To have reached my 40s without even one serious, cohabiting relationship is not something people readily understand; relationships seem to just fall into place so naturally and organically for most people, and by a far younger age, yet I have struggled *all* of my post-adolescent life to even be noticed by the opposite sex, let alone getting anything resembling dates or anything not brief and superficial. Thanks to my huge setback of autism spectrum when I was growing up, and the (likely-resultant) depression I have struggled with since my early teens, I didn't develop the requisite confidence, social skills, and experience in my youth to become a desirable romantic prospect in adulthood. I'm now a very inexperienced 42 year old in a dating market that has become a complete fucking joke. It also goes without saying that it is much harder to meet single people when you get older, let alone to make friends.

There comes a point when doing everything alone makes all but the most mundane, essential tasks like shopping seem incredibly pointless; what's the point of going on that trip or watching that amazing sunset from the ocean bluff when there is no one with whom to share the experience? Going out to enjoy life's simple pleasures gets old when you're always alone. There is nothing novel anymore. The excitement is gone. There is no one waiting for me at home. There is never anyone other than a few relatives to remember my birthdays or celebrate Christmas with. The prospect of finding the love of my life has become something in the realm of fantasy to me, on par with winning the lottery. When you are young, you at least have the social environment of school to meet potential dates, then maybe meeting others via your social circle, but when you're well past the age when most are settled down and established...well...the options are slim to none and you've pretty much missed the boat. As an aging bachelor without anything that can be called a social circle, what are my options now? Dating apps? Months and months (and hundreds of dollars) on multiple dating apps have resulted in absolutely nothing. Rejections from women I've met at meetups have proven the same. And I'm not a physically unattractive guy.

I have had to watch my younger siblings and cousins pair off and establish themselves. My younger brother is married with a family of his own, has been for years now. I know I should be happy for him, and in a way I am, but I can't help but see the contrast between him and I when I see them. I'm still stuck in bachelorhood many years later than what is the norm in the western world. My ring finger has never been adorned with a ring. I'm like an unsold item in a store gathering dust on the clearance rack that no one seems to want.

It is increasingly hard to see a future worth living for. In the normal course of things, a family or at least a significant other gives a man purpose and drive. He wants to get that better job, improve his career prospects, put in that overtime, to afford those vacations and that nicer bigger house in a better neighborhood. Merely supporting myself and living alone in basic studio apartments isn't enough, no matter what I do to cope and distract myself. I'm just existing."

I'm a concerned Dad looking for some thoughts from people who have dealt with depression personally or in your family. I know reddit is not a replacement for professional advice, but I'm still interested in your input. 

So I have a son who recently turned 5. He is the third of four children. An onlooker would probably assess that all is well in his life. He is smiley, smart, funny, friendly, athletic, interested in multiple hobbies, etc. We have a loving family. The older siblings are kind and loving to him. He loves his baby brother. Mom stays at home and is an A+ caregiver. Dad is a white collar professional, but very involved with the kids on a daily basis, coaches the kids' sports teams, plays video games with them, etc. We have the fortunate circumstances of finances never being a concern, big house, big yard, kids have everything they want within reason and without being spoiled rotten. We have loving extended family in all directions. We are religious, but aware and conscious of the way we preach to our kids. We pray together daily and sit and talk about spiritual things as a family at least weekly. We focus on gratitude, love and forgiveness, not on guilt or perfection. I'd say we are pretty fun loving ""cool"" parents, but we do also try to teach our kids to be good people on a daily basis. We tell them when they're not being kind or have made a bad decision. We talk about consequences. The worst punishment we ever hand out is being sent to your bedroom for x amount of time with the freedom to do whatever you'd like their other than use screens. None of the other kids have ever shown any signs of depression. Mom and Dad have never suffered from depression or mental health problems. Both grandams have dealt with and been medicated for depression, that's the extent of family history we know about.

All that said, twice in the last couple months (including last night) our 5 year old son has had incidents of breaking down in tears and saying things like ""the world would be better if I were dead"" and ""nobody would care if I died."" This has happened after incidents of destroying his 9 year old brother's stuff (for whatever reason possesses a kid to torment a sibling) and the 9 year old (who is legitimately super patient, loving and inclusive of his 5 year old brother) getting upset and telling him things like ""you are the meanest brother ever"" but never anything like ""I wish you were dead."" The 5 year old seems to have gotten to the thoughts about death on his own. He basically jumps from ""I'm so mean and I don't know how to stop being mean"" to ""I should just die."" Beyond the two occasions of being nearly inconsolable and talking about his own death being a good thing, the kid is as happy and joyful as could be. 

He has probably considered mortality more often and seriously than is normal for a young child due to his 6 month old cousin dying from a variety of birth complications a little over a year ago. Our whole family attended the funeral and saw the sweet baby girl in an open casket. Since then we have talked about her a lot and answered a lot of questions about death from our children. 

Like many other kids he plays video games (no shooters, we're talking Nintendo Switch stuff like Pokemon/Mario/etc with the most violent being Super Smash) and yells ""I killed you"" or ""I die"" or whatever else and being vigilant parents we almost always give the reminder of ""nobody dies in this game, they get knocked out, say that"" or whatever. I'm just running on at this point, but trying to include background info. 

Anyway, this is of course extremely hard to hear from a five year old. It makes me so incredibly sad that her would even have thoughts like this in passing. Last night my wife and I held him and talked with him for a long time reminding him how much everybody loves him and literally listing dozens of people who would be terribly sad forever if anything ever happened to him. He was back to his normal self this morning. The 9 year old is shaken up and so worried that he's done something wrong. He couldn't sleep for a long time last night after hearing his little brother say these things.

I don't even really know what my question is. What are your thoughts? What should I do?

Obviously, we are considering professional medical/psychological help. We have no issues with addressing mental health. My biggest concern with taking him to the pediatrician to talk about this then to a child psychologist (or whatever the correct technical term for that person might be) whom they refer is that it somehow makes it worse. What if this is just random passing thoughts and not the beginning of depression? Would sitting him down in front of professionals to talk about it just make it worse and more of a focus in his life?

Thanks for any thoughts you can provide. Appreciate you all and hope everyone is feeling motivated and loved today."

Every effort I've made at finding a calling or doing something with my life has resulted in a spiral of self-hate because I failed so stunningly. At my old job everyone took me as a joke because I look like I still go to middle school, and my boss ignored all my time off requests because I 'wasn't up to standards.' My therapist can't help me because she's too fucking idealistic with what my life is/should be, and doesn't accept that I can't do anything without being beaten down.

I can't do anything and haven't had a victory in years, and I can't even just wait for the end because the world will keep on turning.

Nothing brings me joy or happiness, I’ve been on antidepressants for 5 years now and I just feel like this is how life will be until someday when I don’t wake. When I was younger , I had friends, nice girls would want to date me, I had a social life and things to look forward to. Now there’s none of that, I’ve had awful date after awful date over the last couple of years, with the kind of girls that I would never consider “wife material”. At 39 I don’t want to date a 21 year old with daddy issues, or someone with 5 kids but that’s basically all that comes my way these days

I had a traumatic childhood which I’ve never really gotten over. No one knows the abuse I suffered, my parents think I was a quiet child but don’t know why. They assume I was just someone who loved books a little too much,  but they don’t know that books and video games were my escape.

When I look back at my life, I feel like I have tried my best and utterly failed. I’ve always been kind, even now I’m the kind of guy who talks to homeless people , I’ll buy them food and listen to them. I’m kind to my niece and nephew and their smiles are maybe one of the few times when I feel warm and alive. I can’t recall the last time I was a dick to anyone, heck even my best friend jokingly calls me “Jesus” for how selfless i am at times

Despite doing all the right things, I’m alone most of the time, I’m forced to work from home due to current circumstances, when I look ahead , the odds of ever marrying or becoming a father are pretty much nil. When people look at me they see a confident, well groomed guy. But it’s all fake, no one knows how I’ve been drinking on my own until I pass out, or how I cry floods of tears every single night"

""The more you think, the bigger mistakes you make"". And that of course made me think even more, about my life in general, and especially these past couple of years, and how I deal with problems. After awile it came to, it is not about thinking about a situation and how to solve it, but to see it. 

All my life, I had this thought that was making me crazy, and vary angry and depressed: "" What have I done to deserve this?"" following with: ""Why do assholes deserve such a great life?"". Thinking about it, it makes perfect sence, you get something in life, therefore you did something to deserve it. But looking at the situation, NO, nobody gets what they deserve, because deserving doesn't exist. Of course I am not talking about a criminal getting what he ""deserves"" by going to jail. I am talking about the smaller things in life that pile up, and cause all sorts of bad feelings, like the asshole or bitch that gets the great SO, while the nice guy/girl sits alone in the bed, I am talking about people being rude to you in the store, or the deuche who got the promotion instead of you, or the bully who is living a wonderfull adult life, while the kids he bullied are all depressed.

If you look at these situations, you can clearly see, that no body gets what they deserve, either good or bad. And more, maybe deserving as a concept doesn't even exist in the real world.

After this I had a question in my head "" Why should I lead a good life, and treat people good, and try to get more social? Everyone treats me badly why should I treat them good?"" Because Fuck them. They are not getting what you deserve anyway, I will treat you good, for my own sake, I don't care that you don't deserve to be treated good when you treat me like crap, and I don't expect to be treated good for treating others good, and I might not belive I deserve to treat my self good, but fuck that as well, I will treat my self good, becuase I see that deserving has nothing to do with life.

I am interested in hearing your thougts about deserving? Do you think it exist, or has any place in this life? Do we even need that concept to be real?"

Some months ago I met a girl online. We got to know each other and in fact we got really close. She is from a different state which is far from mine. We eventually caught feelings for each other and it we did really good and had some sweet moments and stuff. 

I was really falling in love with her. I really think that she is an amazing, beautiful and talented woman. Falling in love was inevitable. I gave in. 

She already warned me from the start that the thing between us is gonna be hard because we are far away from each other and we haven’t even seen each other in person. I told her it’s okay and we just have to stay strong and wait. We both agreed. She also told me before that she isn’t good at relationships like she isn’t good with expressing her feelings. I also told her it’s okay and I will just try to understand her. 

Then just recently. My greatest fear happened. Season is becoming colder and also her. By the way she talks to me, I can tell that she’s not the same as before. It’s like she’s not as engaged into talking to me. I didn’t do anything at first. I just thought that it’s because she was sick and stressed because of school or personal problems. Then it continued. I began to talk to her straight and ask her if she still has feelings for me. Then she said doesn’t have the same feelings for me as before. I was completely devastated. 

I threatened to kill myself. Which I actually did commit suicide before but I failed. And it was also because of a lost relationship and she knows about it. We talked and called each other. She was also crying. And I couldn’t handle it. I was extremely sad and wanting to die but I also felt that I should stop and must comfort her first. She stayed up all night just persuading me to not do it. I wasn’t feeling sleepy and was actually playing video games but barely doing anything while chatting with her. I can already tell that she was really tired because she can barely type words. I kept telling her to stop and just get some sleep but she kept insisting that she won’t stop until I told her I assured her that I won’t kill myself. I felt that she was losing her mind because of sadness and tiredness because of me. Then for a sudden I completely lost my thoughts of killing myself and just thought about her. I wanted to be with her. Comfort her and take care of her. That night, in my opinion, ended better than I thought. I only slept for 3 hours that night because I had to wake up early for work but I think it wasn’t that bad. 

Up to this day, I’m still talking to her but not as much as before, when things are really great between us. But I just can’t help myself having sad thoughts. I still have suicidal thoughts. I still want to be with her. 

This “love story” of mine I think is the main cause of my sadness right now. But I also have other problems. 

I don’t know what to do with my life. I’m going to join the military but I have no definite goals or dreams. I just kept letting stuff get laid in front of me. I have no plans. I want to help my family but I’m so lazy and I’m not even doing anything about it. I’ve been crying at night for weeks straight. I’ve been praying that I just die in my sleep or get cancer or some major disease and I won’t even ask for help. I just don’t want to suffer any longer. I just feel useless but I don’t have the will to do anything about it. Just a truly useless person. 

People have been telling me don’t worry life will get better. That’s true. Life will get better but not for long and after that happiness you will get sadness after. And that sadness is going to be worse than before. I’ve been saying for a long time that if you get sad, a good thing might happen. But if you get really happy, a bad thing will happen eventually.

People have also been telling me there are others who are more unfortunate and suffers more than me. I should be happy because I’m luckier than them. But I don’t know why I just can’t think like that. I mean. We all have different tolerances. Maybe they’re stronger than me. 

I’m too weak. Emotionally, mentally and physically. I just want to end my suffering."

I tried to get help but never got better. I'm running out of options here. Some days I feel like I need to get help to feel better and other days I just want to give up on everything and that includes meds and therapy sessions. 

I keep changing my therapist because I feel like they judge me all the time, I know it's stupid but I can't help but be bothered by the fact they are only listening because I pay them to. I have anger issues and probably anxiety too. Yesterday I had an argument with my bf and I started hitting myself, I slapped and scracthed my face really hard and hit my desk with my hand until I couldn't feel anything. I usually am very sensitive to pain but I didn't feel any pain when it happened. I'm not sure why but self harm only happens when I'm arguing with my bf not anyone else. I'm also very obsessed over making and saving money, my guess the reason is that's the only thing I can depend on when something bad happens. 

Something is wrong with me and I don't know what exactly, I have only been diagnosed depression and I currently don't have any professional help. How I am is really hard for me to get help. I tend to just cancel my therapy sessions and psychiatrist appointments in the end when I feel suicidal, which results in me never getting help and it cycles back to feeling hopeless. 
Being who I am is stressing me out a lot, I feel sick when I eat, have hard time falling and staying asleep at night. I have constant diarrhea many times a day. It just feels like I have so many issues to fix and I don't know where to begin. Every time I think about my mental issues, I just want to give up and die because there are too many things to be fixed and they are hardly ever going to be fixed, I can never become who I want to be, I just want to be happy and not be stressed over every little thing in my life. I'm feeling so exhausted."

But basically I'm 21 years into my life and don't know how long I can keep doing this.

A bit of background about me: I'm a trans college student, I've been out for about two years. After I came out my family turned out to be not very supportive at all, so I pretty much left the family and live on my own now. I pay for pretty much everything by myself (tuition, rent, groceries, clothes, my hormones) and let me say that this shit just sucks. I don't have a job atm and am basically coasting off my meager savings since my unemployment ran out. If it wasn't for the generosity of my roommate's family and my partner's family, I would probably be out on the street right now. I am trying to get a job right now, but there's a lot of things making that harder than it needs to be. My other roommate has a medical condition that means she would be fucked if she got COVID, and basically the only places that would hire me are grocery stores, retail or food service, which all equate to increased exposure to others and potentially the virus. I don't want to jeopardize her slaving away at minimum wage, so I'm trying to find a job that lets me work remotely, but no luck in that regard either. Trying to find a job as a trans person is a nightmare in and of itself, too. And the winter semester starts up soon, and personally it's very hard for me to balance school and work and not completely burning out.

Speaking of school, it's astronomically difficult for me to succeed. I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD (have been trying to get on meds for years to no success) so productivity, time management and keeping on task are not my strong suit. I was a pretty decent student in high school and the first year and a half of college, but since I came out, I have only completed 9 credits in two years (Funny how that works huh). If it was a perfect world and I didn't have to worry about money, I would take as long as a break I need to get treated and work on myself, but we don't live in a perfect world, and the longer I take to graduate the farther I'm away from stable employment and a living wage.

I can recognize that my life, by objective standards, is not that terrible - I have a loving partner who supports me for who I am and is the highlight of my life, I have a handful of good friends (albeit distanced due to the pandemic), I have a roof over my head, etc. - but to me it's just miserable. First, just being a trans person is exhausting. I know my friends would disagree with me, but I feel so ugly and dissatisfied with my appearance. Looking in the mirror I only notice my imperfections and feel so far removed from the ideal self I want to be. The ideal self that could be achieved with various surgeries, but those are way out of my budget and probably always will be, and who's to say I would even be happy with them. And that's just what I think of myself. I know so many people see me as a weird looking boy, I get called sir and man all the time even when I'm dressed to the nines in feminine tops and skirts and tights and shoes. It's so frustrating!

Even though I find can still find momentary joy, live does not feel like it is worth living. Let's consider my potential future if nothing goes wrong: I graduate undergrad, I go to grad school to get a degree in library sciences (I wanted to be an English teacher or a writer, but I'm not very good with people and I hate my writing, so a librarian feels like the next logical way to use my degree. My ideal job is one where I rarely have to talk to people, and where I can just zone out and organize or catalog or digitize or research materials in a quiet, slow-paced environment sounds like heaven), I graduate again, I find a job, I make about 50\~60k a year for who knows how many years until I die. The average cost of living according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics is about 20k a year, but it considers the average rent to be 570 a month, and where I live it's about 800-1000 a month for a 2br, 1bath apartment. And considering how ridiculously expensive everything is getting, let's just say the average cost of living is 30k a year. That leaves \~25k a year in savings. Gender-affirming surgeries and procedures can total up to more than six figures. Doing some basic math, and accounting the fact I probably won't find a stable job until 2025, that means I won't be able to have enough money to afford those procedures until 2030! And that's not even accounting for the fact it takes years to schedule some surgeries. I'm ten years out from just looking like the woman I want to be! It sucks enough to live a day in my body, and you're telling me I have to live another decade like this! Don't even get me started on how long it would take to save up for a house. You get the point though. My life is far from ideal, and I'm so far away from even getting there that it feels like an eternity away.

Aside from all that, my biggest fear is that I'll live an unremarkable life, die and be remembered for nothing. I want to be *something*. I've always dreamed of being a content creator of some sort, be it an author or cartoonist or video game designer, so I really want to make a piece of media that has as profound of an effect on other people as my favorite pieces of media has on me. Only problem is, I'm not that good at much of anything. And, yes, I do know that you just don't wake up and write a best-selling novel in one day, it takes lots of time and hard work and keeping at it, but it feels like I've just tried and failed. I play Super Smash Bros. competitively and stream, but I'm not good and have no following on Twitch so I stopped. I tried to make a Pokemon ROM hack over the summer, but my right-brained self can not get a grasp on coding and I gave up. I try to work on short stories and non-fiction but just end up hating everything I write. I like cosplaying and have started to post pics of them to social media, but people seem more preoccupied with pointing out my dick and calling me a dude than appreciating the time and effort that went into the cosplay. I love drawing and got quite into it in high school, but I fell out of it and it feels like I'll never be able to regain my talent. My friends tell my I'm a good cook so I'm trying to start a YouTube cooking channel, but no one will probably watch it anyways. It feels like I've failed so many times that I'll never be able to accomplish my goal, so I should just give up. Focus on school and get a job and live a mediocre life working day in and day out for however many years. It just all feels pointless.

I would commit suicide if not for the fact I would be leaving people who really do care about me behind. I attempted in May of this year and posted on a goodbye on Twitter about it, and I would've gone through with it if not for the barrage of messages I got convincing me to live another day. But other than that, I really don't feel like life is worth it. Sure, there's little things; if I died now, I would never get to play the next Zelda game or take that trip to Japan I've always wanted to. But at the end of the day I'm fine without those things. Each day feels like a chore, and with the hell world we live in, it feels like it gets more and more hopeless with each passing day.

This is getting long and rambling at this point, so I'll just end it here. I really just needed a space to collect my thoughts and air this all out. Thanks for reading if you got this far."

I know people are trying to help when they say, ""It takes time, it will get better, the only way is up, everyone deserves to be happy"". But whenever I hear this stuff, i have to be very careful not to roll my eyes or laugh. I can't lie to myself anymore and tell myself these lies. I've done it multiple times now and to do it it again would be moronic. 

I won't write out everything but give a brief rundown of what i mean:

\- Unstable family - Bi-polar mum, enabling dad, dad had an affair, I placed everyone else above me even as a child.

\- Feel good in a way i never have at university (Friends, working hard, feel like a person)

\- Get into abusive rl at uni, she isolates me from friends, guilt trips me, uses mental health issues as justification for her words and actions, rapes me, generally destroys my personality, lose touch with everyone including myself, 6yrs of this.

\- Made redundant at first job post university and nothing but minimum wage here after.

\- Friend of 20yrs who talked about making me best man at his wedding told his partner about how i suspected my partner was absuing me. She then told my partner at the time and made my abuse worse. He didn't even apologize at first, he did on the second attempt but it felt so fake and insincere. I said i forgave him, but months later i told him i don't want to speak to him again.

\- While getting therapy during the middle of the pandemic i went to my local park so i can get some privacy. A random group of teenagers insulted and intimidated me multiple times after i moved to another bench so they could play football without me being in the way. I did this before they talked to me. That's right, i was being nice and that was my treatment. Just like trying to help my mum or helping my abusive ex with her social anxiety and depression. After being insulted and intimidated multiple times in the middle of a therapy call, i push one of them away and the police give me a police caution that will show up in any jobs working with kids, elderly or those at risk. Police never contacted my therapist like they said they would. The mother of the kid wanted to charge me for full assault and was not willing to sit down with me and an officer to talk about things to maybe avoid action all together. Her excuse was she is struggling with mental health and her son has PTSD. I have PTSD from abuse and your kid antagonizes but he has PTSD so it's fine, okay. i'm sorry he has PTSD but guess what, so did my abuser, doesn't make it okay or give them an excuse. Worse of all she doesn't want to meet because she has health issues of her own, oh how dandy, everyone gets a get out of jail free card because of their mental health except me. 

Things won't get better, i know that for certain now."

I have a loving family and a few friends that(might)care about me but tbh I feel like they are better off without me

Every day I feel that I'm just a waste of human and that will most likely end as a failure and or grow up to be an adult that will most likely be in debt and die a slow depressing life that will only lead to misery and mental disorder

I'm not doing as well in my education as I used to.Its like I've lost all motivation to study and I mostly spend most of my days either listening to music or just look put the window thinking about what might my future hold

I'm not physical active as when I were 12 and I'm slowly start to become increasingly angry at myself for not being active and at the same time knowing it just my pure laziness that killing....motivation no longer exist in my world

I'll either end it soon or I'll just be too scared to scared to end it and grow up to be a disappointment....I hope that you dont end up like me and have a wonderful life:)"

It's a powerful tool to remind me that inaction is not okay and I have to move. Here's the transcript",6,2,1609340897.0,"Hey Alex,

I always say there’s a turning point. I always say that tomorrow’s going to be different. After this bath it’s going to be different. After I eat this meal it’s going to be different. Everyday I tell myself the same lie that I’m going to do something different - I’m going to study, I’m going to work, I’m going to socialize or go into the dating scene or something like that.

And for the past two years and a half\*, I haven’t done most of what I wanted to do. Congratulations, me. I’ve moved out, you know, successfully. I have my own place\*\*. That’s pretty cool. I have enough money. That’s great. But what about the other fulfillment, you know? What about my social fulfillment? I just got laid out of work, you know? And it’s not because I wanted to quit, even though I hated working there, it’s because of all these negatives are just pulling me down.

^(\* break up with a long-term 3 years relationship, where we lived together, due to stress and a dead bedroom.  Took me over an year to feel 95% about the breakup. I since only had sex with one other person since, without any meaningful romantic relationship)

^(\*\* since starting my college life, I lived one semester in a frat, one semester in a dorm-like facility, then an year with my parents, two years and a half with my ex, two years with my parents again, and now sharing an apartment with my best friend for the last 6 months)

And this is just another report, this is just another turning point that doesn’t exist. You know, no matter how many drugs I use\*, no matter how many highs and lows, how many I’ve been deceived by thinking that everything’s okay, you know. It’s not like that.

^(\* This sounds more exaggerated than it is. I recently experimented with shrooms and LSA and bought BDO to try out later. I don't drink to mellow out my sorrows and I do not smoke.)

Alex, you need help. I need help. Professional help. For real.

But every time I think about it, I think “yeah, I’m going to do this later, but I am going to do it”, you know. Because of the anxiety it brings. The thought of having to call someone and talk to someone and do things in general has been debilitating my life since, since eu conheço eu por gente, since I have been. It’s not longer just a social anxiety. Because the social anxiety came with Luana\*, right? I stopped being active on messenger, and it always has been a downhill battle from there. I manage to do the base minimum, and sometimes, not even that.

^(\* messy high school breakup that lead to depression-like symptoms, lost interest in a lot of things I love and broke away from social media, never 100% recovered since)

It hurts to know that… It’s tough, working on your own. I don’t have any classes that I have to attend otherwise I’m going to fail, it’s all on my own. And having that lack of someone, you know, checking me out, someone looking for me, someone that I have to prove myself to, and only having to prove to someone that is myself is, well, it’s devastating my life. I can’t handle it, myself.

If classes are online, I can just do them later and procrastinate myself. I’m already feeling it, I’m going to procrastinate this whole semester of college again and then I’m going to, you know, and just say I’m going to do it next semester or two semesters and that’s going to be it, forever, I’m never going to change, am I? I’m always going to be me.

But this has to change, you know, there’s a difference between Alex and the person who Alex wants to be, because that’s also Alex, that’s the future Alex, that’s the grownup Alex. You know?

I want to be this person that can thrive, can maintain an active social circle, that can enjoy things again, that doesn’t have any anxiety when…

Man, my anxiety took a downfall, huh? I keep thinking and creating expectations for new experiences and I don’t experience them – it took me a week to listen to the new Persuader\* album, it takes me years to play any new videogame, and it’s all because of this generalized anxiety.

^(\* basically a favorite band of mine)

What have I been doing that hasn’t been airplane mode, autopilot, for the last year or two? I’m finally unemployed and that means going after jobs myself, and sincerely, I’m up to the task but I’m not sure I’m up to the task. Life has been pretty easy for me for the most part. I’ve had a job without trying, I’ve had the best, well, the only relationship in my life without trying too hard, I’m living with someone else, with my best friend, and it wasn’t a mega effort or anything. Everything comes easy. And you know that, deep inside, it’s there, you know, this anxiety, this depression it’s there.

Ever since Itajubá\*, you know that can’t live by yourself, because you know that if you are by yourself, you’re not self-sufficient, you worry about your future in the United States\*\*. You worry that, when you get there, you’re not going to get a job, and it’s not because of trying it’s because you’re not going to try, it’s because you’re going to fall in this depressive state.

^(\* moving out for college was a disaster. Moved out of an abusive frat to living in a place where I socialized with nobody. My mental health wasn't pretty back then. I moved back and got into my current college)

^(\*\* I was born in the US and am currently living in South America. My plan is to complete my free college education here before emigrating)

I know you. You know yourself. But you try to hide it. You try to think, well, that’s for future me, I can solve it but, I’m not solving it man. I’ve grown older, my political views have matured, sure, I’m experimenting with drugs, which is something I always wanted to but, yeah in my career I’m learning a lot but, it’s still the same me. It’s still the same state that I’m unhappy of. Like, do I need to be like this, all the time?

I want more. I want more from life. I think that, I’m not getting enough. Because I’m not even getting enough as a baseline perspective. I’m living here, and I’m not cooking enough, I’m not even exploring myself, doing stuff that I can do own my own. Where’s all the new cooking? You’ve learned one or two new recipes but that’s about it. Where’s the new stuff?

I don’t want to believe that I’m doomed to my same old ways, I really don’t. I really want to do believe that there is a future where I am more capable, and self-sufficient, and happy. I’m not so numb, where things happen in my life, major things, and they just pass by. Why does everything pass by? It’s lot like a big blur but…

Alex, you need to live life. And it’s hard, I understand. You don’t understand people the way that other people understand people. You’re different, your brain’s different\*. People have to connect to you for you to connect to them, it takes a while to connect. But there are people out there, you know, dudes that want to hang out with you, or girls that want to hang out with you, even though if you’re weird. I’m not sure if it’s a matter of embracing my weirdness or not.

^(\* formally diagnosed when I was young with Asperger's. I'm mostly normal but you can tell if you get to know me)

But I need to face this, I need to accept this. But how do I even start? Do I just go to a random psychiatrist, psychologist rather and just start blabbering about, “hi, I’m this guy on the spectrum that has been living off anxiety” Did I really waste two years and a half of my life for anxiety? I don’t know.

On paper, I’m not so bad, I know enough of web development for a junior, mid-level position, sure. I can handle myself. But I need more from my life. I need much more.

This was supposed to be a memo, to myself in the future, but it’s not, it’s a twelve-minute-long rambling. And it hurts, because, if you’re not numb, you feel it, but if you’re not feeling it, you’re numb and it going to be pushed to the back of your head tomorrow. Good luck. I really need to get my shit together.

Love yourself, Alex, don’t fuck up, as I have fucked up.

But that’s it, that’s about it. Get therapy my dude, get therapy.

started college this year (uk), and dropped out shortly after to get help with my mental health which never ended up happening. college just wasnt for me, wasnt interested in any courses and i cannot make friends for the life of me and felt like everyone was judging me.

lost a lot of friends this year, dropped two friends who were guilt tripping me for my anxiety and tried outing me. and then the rest we don't really speak or we were never close in the first place or they've all got new friends, maybe i could do something about this but it's scary?

tried attempting to take my life too this year and i really do feel like i'll try to do it again. it was one of the scariest days of my life i think, but i don't think it will stop me because i really do feel as if my life is going nowhere and it's one big endless loop of the same tv episode over and over again. 

i have no motivation to do anything anymore and i have nothing i like, aside from playing video games but i feel as if im wasting my life away when i play. there's not much i like to do and i'm not really talented at anything else. i'm scared for my future, and i don't feel like i'll get anywhere in life and i'll life off my parents forever.

This year, while awful, has been amazing at teaching (at least me) things. This year, I noticed behaviors I had that needed adjustment, found a new hobby, and realized that I was feeding into my demons.

When I started to reflect on myself, I noticed that I hadn't been the real me for a very, very long time. I allowed the people around me to influence me so much, I lost sight of my values. 2020 has shown me that and shown me who I really want to be. I noticed recently that I never had any hobbies. I loved to play video games and watch tv/movies. This stemmed from high school, I never really had any friends that I hung out with regularly, and the only time I had a good experience with people was when I was alone, or when I wasn't in my home town.

I've started finding joy in things I do again. This has led me to want to live again, but not without remembering the lessons I have learned.

Here are the changes that I am actively trying to make:

1.) Generosity - I want to volunteer more and donate more to charity

2.) Creativity - I want to be more crafty

3.) Positivity - This one is going to be super hard...

4.) Intellect - I want to study more

5.) Patience - I'm impatient

6.) Mindfulness - I need to meditate more

&#x200B;

I've realized that I allow myself to react to things, I feed into my anxiety and depression, but I know I can overcome it. So can you. I believe in you.

kn34hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kn34hn/i_know_i_will_never_be_desirable/,I know i will never be desirable,33,42,1609338245.0,"I have a very, very rough life, like everyone here. I’ve been through many abusive “relationships,” but i’ve only ever dated once in person, and that was back in 2018. And in all of them, they broke up with me. I didn’t want it, but they did. 

All of my friends tell me I’m amazing, and what’s sad is it took 4 of them that i treasured close to my heart completely degrading and reaming me for shit i either didn’t do or was exaggerated to make me look worse to make me realize that. Friends i trusted with dark secrets. Friends i trusted with very easily misunderstandle/misinterpretable situations and secrets. Friends that, in hindsight, abused me and utilized my loneliness and feening for giving affection for their own gain. They conspired against me just to tear me down. And yet i forgave 2 of them... (the other two went too far, even for me)

But even if i’m amazing, i’m still undesirable. I look homeless because i don’t shave/trim, people assume i’m older and have called me a pedophile and creep for flirting with girls my own age, and my hair naturally dreadlocks itself. I have a pretty bad lazy eye, and without my beard, i look like i’m 12. I’m told i’m attractive, and i’m told i’ve an amazing personality, but not a single person i meet is into me

What’s even more sad is i literally met the perfect person for me. In every regard. I’d have a chance if she wasn’t taken, but that honestly doesn’t make me special. But even if it did, i i shouldn’t need to feel special for something like that. And because she’s so perfect, i honest to god don’t want anyone else. I’m just honest to god in love with her, and i just want her to be happy more than anything

I’m off track... with literally everyone i meet, i’m just a friend. I’ve never been anything more unless someone who’s abusive thinks i’m good enough and will deal with their shitty treatment enough. I’m honestly easy to abuse, and for the most part, it’s what i know. 

I don’t know what it’s like for someone to want me so much they gush when they see me. I don’t know what it’s like for someone i don’t know to give me a compliment on my appearance (unless they’re contradicting what i said about myself). I don’t know what it’s like for someone to see me and just want to hug me. I don’t know what it’s like to be treated like i matter, at least until i get suicidal; then i matter. But all my friends know what it’s like, and if you think i’m assuming, i know for a fact because i’ve been like that with them. 

I only have 2 people actively in my life (aforementioned girl becoming a 3rd, so that makes me feel better), and very few people who won’t leave me on read constantly. And due to this, as well as being high functioning autistic, i’ve very poor social skills, especially with more than one person present. Coupled with a fear of rejection, i don’t even try to make new friends often. That fear of rejection is why i missed my chance, actually. I should have just asked her, but i decided to take it slow.

This isn’t a post for advice on dating; like i said, everyone else will just be disappointing now. I already know what it’s like to not be enough, i don’t need to give someone else that damnation. I’ve just finally come to realize that i will never be desirable to anyone. At least, for nor more than a punching bag or someone to catch you if you fall

I really don't think that's healthy. I want him to do something so he doesn't waste away in bed. I don't know how to convince him tho. I've tried talking to him but he'd rather sleep.

im a very empathetic person and since i remember it makes my life a struggle. i was diagnosed with a depression, anxiety and bpd as a teenager (im 28 now) and through the years i like to say i got better cause i worked hard (im also on right meds). but there are things that also got worse for me. 

when i was an angsty teen i used to read and watch terrible stuff on the internet and i mean even the dark web level kind of stuff. why? i have no idea. it was unpleasant and i would say traumatic. in that time of my life i saw and read about the worse things that people are able to do to another being. when i realized how many vulnerable kids and animals are abused and raped daily something broke in me and its getting worse and worse. 

i remind myself about the dark reality all of sudden, more and more often, in the weirdest situations. i have visions in my head that are terrible and i cant ignore them. my heart is pounding, my throat is closing and tears coming to my eyes. and the realization that i cant help and save make my mind weaker and weaker. i was always suicidal but because of that i got worse again and started to think about suicide daily (and i was free from that for like three years). 

i have no idea how to deal with this. i tried to desensitize by educating myself more and more on the subject, take it as a simple reality that i need to accept, but it doesnt help. i like to call myself an activist, i do everything i can to make things in this world better but its always not enough so singing petitions and donating money dont help either. and im tired. cause no matter how hard i try to help its still a drop in an ocean.

any ideas how to deal with it? i appreciate your time and thank you."

I’m an average dude, average height, average weight, average looks, average job, average everything. I could not say a single thing about me which is interesting or say anything that I’m good enough at to even mention.  
  
I would love to have a family but I can’t see that happening.  
Between the ages of 17-23 I spent everyday that I can remember wishing I was dead. I’d written countless notes, thought up 1000s of different ways that I could end things but I never did anything. I could never go through with it, so instead I would hope that something would happen to me which killed me so I didn’t have to do it myself. Driving to work hoping that someone would hit me head on, going to the doctors when I felt something funny and just praying that it was something terminal.  
  
I cut myself a few times but never really consistently did it or felt the urge to do it. Whenever I did, it was mostly nothing, not deep enough to leave scars. The only thing I can see now is the faint scar of me carving ‘not good enough’ into the top of my thigh.  
  
My last girlfriend fucked me up a bit as she was extremely affectionate and would always lie in bed with me telling me how much I meant to her, how much she loved me and she’d never felt this way about anyone else before etc etc. Suppose I should’ve been a bit cautious considering we had only been together for a matter of months but I lapped it up instead. She ended things, got back with her ex boyfriend who’s an abusive piece of shit and when I showed a bit of emotion about things coming to the end she then started calling me a weirdo because we had apparently only met ‘a couple of times’. Her saying this tanked my confidence even further, I felt like such a mug for believing anything she said and also just the fact that someone could lie to my face for months and fake all this lovey shit and then just drop me so easily without a second thought was pretty devastating to me.  
  
I don’t really know what to do anymore, I’m pretty sure that all my problems stem from my anxiety, depression and self-worth issues but I don’t know what to do about it. I went to my doctor 2 years ago and they prescribed me with Sertraline and kept upping the dose when I said it wasn’t really doing anything. I ended up coming off them completely because I was getting frustrated that I was still feeling all the shit I was before but now I was feeling it with other stuff like being extremely lethargic and having no sex drive whatsoever.  
  
Does anyone have any advice or experiences they could share if they went through the same sort of thing?  
I’m really not in a good place at the moment and I’m worried about things getting worse"

kn0s27,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kn0s27/safe_place/,Safe place,3,2,1609328402.0,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the majority of my teenage years and early adulthood (21 now). I started to struggle when my life at home started to deteriorate. My dad, who likes to drink had started to become increasingly aggressive to me, he would blow up over anything, threaten to kick me out, or try to intimidate me or just yelling verbal abuse at me every chance he got. I felt very self conscious and truth be told, I started to believe everything he would say and it really took it’s toll on me. I began to withdraw myself from my friends at school as I had become extremely anxious. I missed more and more days of school as my attendance had always been great before instead choosing to stay at home and lock myself away in my room sleeping and watching YouTube so that I could avoid my dad and the world. Soon after this I sank further into depression as my gran died. This broke me completely and my mum, who has been the best mom I could ever ask for was shattered by the lose of her mum. At home it began to seem evident that as I would stay in my room for the majority, my dad had turned his anger to my mum...although never being violent towards her, he would try to make her feel like shit and put her down, then sometimes act like nothing ever happened. It was horrible to see that my mum who always defended me against him, was now becoming the recipient of his anger and I felt guilty for not doing anything but terrified of the consequences if I tried to intervene. My mum does everything for us, works full time and takes care of my grandad and is not argumentative in the slightest. I could see that the stress was taking its toll on her. Yet as her husband it seemed like he was only interested in pilling on more stress and making the house a very toxic and uneasy place to be. 
During this period I began to think that it would be easier to just not be here anymore as I couldn’t escape my all this stress, negativity, anxiety and had no motivation for anything. 

This went on for a few years until I eventually finished school and racked up the motivation and decided to get a job, and start trying seeing my friends again to combat my shitty home life although many had moved on with their lives, I was grateful that there were still a group that I felt wanted me around.
Things were starting to look up, despite life at home still being miserable.
Even though I had a job now, which I was able to keep myself together for, I would still feel anxious and stressed, sometimes over the littlest things. My grandads health has now started to deteriorate, and my mums health seems to be getting worse as well and she’s still having to put up with my dads shit. She had asked him for to leave but he refused and when she asked him for a divorce, he told her that she would have to sell the house, something my mum can’t afford to do.

I had also I plucked up the courage to ask out a girl I had liked for sometime. I fell for her way harder than I could of imagined and this only grew as we started to see more of each other which was difficult as the pandemic took over everything. 
Whenever we were together I loved it but I couldn’t help but feel anxious and stressed that she would call it quits after a while.
It eventually happened a couple months back and it has hit hard, just a few weeks before it I had been signed off my work due to anxiety and stress after breaking down in work and since then I have spiralled back into a deep depression which I can’t seem to shake and all I seem to have is negative thoughts, whether it be about worrying about my mum, grandad, the future, thinking about the girl I dated. It’s so overwhelming and I feel that I am such a burden on my friends who have their own stuff going on and I don’t want to constantly hassle them about how miserable I am and my mum who already has enough on her plate without having to deal with my problems and doesn’t need anymore stress. I have now fallen behind with my college course and yet I know it, I can’t seem to find the motivation to even get out of bed and do daily activities. The prospect of interacting with people is so daunting and makes me anxious, even with my friends.
I have never been so low and I can’t help but dwell on everything that has happened. I am now on anti-depressants which I was always reluctant to use, have been really struggling to sleep and having panic attacks when I get stressed.
Waking up each day just doesn’t seem worth it.
I feel so broken.

I have always struggled to talk to people about how I feel and what’s been going on and so this seemed like a safe place to do so and see if it helped at all."

It's killing me.,1,0,1609327633.0,"Lately, my depression has been pretty bad. Recently, I've also been diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD. My family has been less understanding and less open to letting me teach them why I am the way I am. That was nearly the last push until I decided to go and chat with my ""closest friend"" because that's what any couple or group of close friends do right? When one is feeling down their close friends usually say ""you can talk to me when you need to."" That's the usual with close friends right?? 

Well, I guess I'm wrong about that because the other day I messaged them about being depressed and mentally exhausted. Keep in mind, this particular ""close friend"" has been pursuing this goal of becoming more extrovert/more social. Now, I'm not against anyone who wants to chase that goal of getting out of their shell. I encouraged that certain friend to keep pursuing that goal but the more we talked over the months the more I noticed their change and it wasn't a change for good. The more ""extroverted"" they became with their new friends the more of an asshole they became. 

Their greetings over texts slowly turned from that typical friendly name calling that any best friend would do to a less friendly teasing like ""hey/sup freak"" or ""how's it going boring ass,"" and more insertive/not really giving me an option ""we're going to be in a video call in 10 minutes."" I will also add that last month on my birthday they messaged me with ""happy birthday. Hope your day takes a turn for the worst.""

Anyway, this change showed its worst face when I msgd them for support during this wave of depression and it was one of those times when you could feel it in your chest wishing for your actual death. They replied back with ""haha loser,"" and ""good vibes only.""

At that point I just fucking gave up on them and ended the friendship there. In all honesty I should've ended it earlier when the red flags were right in my face. I couldn't handle the toxicity anymore."

That was by design by people that never had by best interest ever at heart. I’m my one and only support and you all you know, that you won’t ever get far this way. 

On the other hand death is also equally an impossible task. Although there’s not many unknowns with this but it’s just something I’m not capable of performing. I would say it’s the best direction for me to take but I just don’t see how I would be able to do it. I’m just a coward, well some would say that’s a good thing because it keeps me here.

I feel like I’m at the point in my life where things just won’t get better. I try to set goals for my self but always seem to fail. Even the little things like getting out of be before noon. I failed that today and then I have just spent the last 13 hours laying here. 

I used to be a cook before covid, but after losing 3 jobs in the past 9 months I’ve lost all motivation to do the only thing I kind of liked to do. 

I had plans to travel the world, I finally felt like my life might be going somewhere then that was cancelled by covid. I made new plans to try to complete a life goal of mine, again plans where canceled by covid. And by the time covid is over and I make enough money to get back in my feet and out of debt again, I don’t see my self being able to complete my goals. 

Every-time I take a step forwarding feels like someone kicks me 5 steps back. I not really looking for advice, just venting."

It’s not a full lockdown, but I can’t go out with friends (can meet them outside in sub zero temps), no bars, restaurants, cinemas holidays or live music at all. Life has no color and feels like Groundhog Day. 

The vaccine is fantastic news but the media keep finding excuses as to why we should stay this way. I’m currently isolating too, which is necessary but sucks ass. 

They are saying things may be much better by spring, but even staying like this till spring feels impossible."

I’ve never really spoken about this to anyone so I’ve decided to just let it all out here since no one will know who I really am. It’s crazy to think that I’ve been struggling with depression since I was a kid. My cousins took advantage of me and my innocence. They molested me and threaten if I ever spoke up no one would believe me. One did things to me when I was only 5 another cousin when I was 8 and the last when I was 10. When I was 11 my grandma passed away from cancer and I could never cope with it and still can’t to this day. Then comes a different part of my life. I was going to start middle school/jr high with no friends bc I was bullied by my “friends” in elementary. At 14 I made friends with the wrong crowd and was taking ecstasy as a cry out for help. One time I had taken 5 pills and mix it with tequila ready to just end my life even tho I didn’t know that’s what I was doing. At the same time I began take those pills I was discovering my sexuality. I was at my rock bottom but I was able to pick myself up.

I tried so hard to make friends hs but for some reason everyone hated me. Maybe they knew about my drug addiction? Who knows. I was jumped my junior year and suspended from school for it. I met my first gf ever and I was happy for the first time in a long time or so I thought. She cheated on me and verbally and physically abused me. I tried to dead my life again but didn’t succeed. I graduated hs and my family was so proud of me but I saw myself as a failure. I tried to go to college and took a few classes but the fear of not being able to make friends and feeling alone scared me too much so I dropped out and disappointment my parents. 

I started working and thought everything was going well for me but then I started drinking every single night in my room by myself. I then started working in a theme park and made a few friends working there and even found someone I fell for. She was out and wanted to keep it a secret and which is exactly what my first gf did and I agreed to it but then it started again. I was being manipulated and abused by her. She made me believe she was the only one there for me and my friends weren’t my friends but when my grandfather passed away she was nowhere to be found and my friends were there for me. The relationship was very toxic and we decided we were better off as friends with benefits but even then she was horrible to me. One night she told me I made the relationship up in my head and what we had never happened. That’s when I knew it was time to ended everything. She made me feel like I was going crazy and I was drinking a lot more and tried to kill myself again but I couldn’t do it bc I thought about me causing my family so much pain.

Months later I download tinder and met someone and we just clicked. I fell so hard for her and then I drove out to see her almost 2hrs away from my place. I was so happy but I knew in order for it to work one of us had to move so I decided I would do it and so I did. I left everything behind and I was depressed again. All the friends I had made stopped talking to me I had no one at here and I was having a hard time getting a job. She was able to get me a job where she work but I wasn’t happy. I got a job somewhere else and I was so happy. I thought I would be able to make friends in this city but I was wrong. I was treated (still am) like an outsider. No one made me feel welcomed instead they all judged me for being a lesbian and made little comments and gossiped behind my back even went as far as started a group chat to talk about me. 

And now we’re here. Im all alone and can’t talk to anyone about my problems because I feel like no one will understand me. I live in a city where I barely know how to get around and don’t have any friends I can run to for advice or just to hang out with. I wish I had someone I could talk to. I can’t even tell my gf or family anything because i don’t want to disappoint them or burden them. Sometimes I feel like i’ll be okay and then bam I think about everything I’ve been through in my life and how many times I tried to end my life and sometimes I wish I would have just done it so I wouldn’t here. I’m not happy and I’m not okay. Sometimes I’m so numb to everything. So if someone out there reads this I’m sorry."

First off hope everyone is doing alright amidst all the madness in the world right now. Im a 29M who would classify myself as a high functioning depressed person. That is, I hide my depression very well and thankfully have been able to still achieve some life goals.

Im an attorney in Los Angeles (good income but high stress), no debt/financial worries due to job, have the best dog ever whom has been my best friend for the last 10 years, and am dating the love of my life(hopefully fiance by end of 2021). Yet with with all, I'm just depressed. I'm embarrassed because so many people have it way worse than me and yet here I am complaining on reddit.

Life hasn't always been great and i have a lot of issues from my childhood. Mom was a druggie who constantly put my life in danger(moved me from San Diego to tijuana to live with her violent boyfriend who physically assaulted her and I multiple times(hitting and once trying to shoot her), drunk driving accidents with me in the car, stint of homelessness, the list goes on). I used to think about offing myself but those thoughts went away after life got better. I still have dark humor but more than anything I just try to put on the happy face. 

I tried SSRI's before, weren't for me. I tried microdosing psilocybin mushrooms, helped a bit. Have contemplated hormone replacement therapy(trt, as my levels are ""low-normal"" for my range, but the risks I think outweight the potential benefits. Have been looking at ketamine therapy. 

Once thing I've noticed is that my depression has been with me so long that it is a part of me. On good days I sometimes find myself missing the feeling of being sad, which is so strange to me. Does anyone else experience this? I'm nervous about continuing to search for a cure when it may be too much a part of me to let go.

Edit: some horrible grammar. Sorry im tired."

I’m not sure where else to post this or who to talk to but I feel down. I just had maybe the 1000th conversation with my mom about my career choice which is film. I want to be a filmmaker. I genuinely enjoy making films. Even though I’ve only ever made 2 films. I’m 22. And film first peaked my interest when I was 17. I entered one of my films to the Tribeca Film Festival on advice of my film teacher and it got in for the young adults portion. I’m really proud of that. The only issue is my mom never and never will approve of my career choice. And this has really brought me down over the years. I tried to do a major she would be more approving of (economics/finance) but ended up hating it and left school. I tried once more to get back into it at a community college but just couldn’t find any motivation or passion to succeed in it. I tried to explain to my mom that film is what I really wanted to do but she never understood. She wasn’t born here and has a very traditional mindset. She thinks that you have to sell your soul and body to make it in the film industry. And no she’s not joking lol. She constantly says film is not ‘’our’’ career choice and compares me to my other childhood friends who are all majoring in the medical field. Over the years this has brought me down and I sort of went into limbo and became severely depressed. But I won’t contribution my whole depression to just her but it was definitely a contributing factor. Now, at 22, I decided film is what I want to do. I stupidly messed up my relationship with my film teacher so I’m not sure she’s willing to still guide me. I reached out to my mom’s former employer who (funny as it is) has a son who worked in a lot of big projects in Hollywood to ask for advice. Today I felt it wasn’t right to not include her in the loop and told her I reached out to her ex boss. She got upset and basically told me that I wasn’t her daughter and that she wanted to move back to her country. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I’m 22 and I feel like life is passing me by. I already know going into film is a risk and to be talked down out of something I enjoy is taking a toll on me."

I miss you so much, but what can I do?

I love you so much

but what can I do?

I just want to roll over and die. This is the end. It was all meaningless in the end. It felt like this great and grand love story and it felt like I had finally found the purpose

and then you left me and now I know that it never meant anything. I didn’t find my purpose, because I have no purpose. No one does. It’s all just a bunch of random moments that will eventually be over for all of us.

It doesn’t make me feel much better. Even knowing that all life comes to an end and even this suffering will one day be over (no matter what)

I still miss you

I love all of them but they don't fulfill me and I don't know why. Or maybe I do and I'm in denial.

I spend time with my friends fairly often because they make an effort to text me to hang out and I love that they care enough to ask me to chill with them. And when I'm actually with them I enjoy my time. But everytime I get home I'm left with my own thoughts, and it's always this disgusting self loathing and self pity.

I believe I am some form of narcissistic because I thrive off of positive attention. I don't want to admit it but I love hearing people saying good things about me, especially when it comes to my appearance. I try to suppress this part of me because I hate it, but my ears can't help but perk up when my name is mentioned. 

At the beginning of 2020 I was in a relationship with someone who I cared for dearly and she left me. It took a serious toll on my mental health, I felt like I wasn't good enough. My self confidence was sky high during that period and when she broke up with me it fell to an all time low, I felt like I was undesirable. Now I strongly dislike the way I look on most days. 

I'm so sick of the negativity but I can't open up to people. I keep myself reserved because I feel safest that way, even though I know there are people in my circle that I can talk to. So I just wanted to write about it, even if it is just to a wall. At least I'm finally saying what I've been holding in, in some form. I've been holding so much inside."

Covid aside, this was one of the hardest years of my life. But I chugged on through because the plan was to die at the end of the year. It gave me comfort that no matter how bad shit got, there was that way out. But despite this being one of the hardest years, I've decided not to do it. 

So now what? I never planned on being alive to see 2021. 

Making the decision to live was huge, but now I'm the one that has to pick up the pieces. I maxed out credit cards buying stupid shit, ate like shit and gained a bunch of weight, and basically fucked around most of the year. Quarantine helped with that.

Now I have to live through the consequences of my actions this year, all the while dealing with my still fucked up head. I have to face my friends and family, with them not knowing my original plan. Act like I'm fine. To them, nothing will have changed with me. Do I tell them? 

I have one semester of school left now, and am expected to get a job once I'm done. Then what? Just exist? What's the point in all of this?

TL;DR I planned on killing myself before the new year, have decided not to. I made the plan last year, and lived the year out like it was my last. Now I have to deal with the ramifications of my actions. What am I supposed to do now?"

I even bashed my head against a doorframe in front of my mother earlier because I'm just so lost and I guess I wanted to convey that somehow."

I am fairly new to Reddit and hope I'm posting this correctly. I am really just trying to reach out for help/advice for coping with things. I am 30 years old and 6 months pregnant with my first child. I've struggled with depression off and on my entire life. I seem to have good and bad days and today is one of those bad days. I have an extreme fear of needles and I had to get blood drawn today because they let me put it off until the last possible moment. I thought I was calm and prepared enough for it but as soon as I sat down for it, I had a pretty extreme trauma response. I immediately began crying which then led to a full panic and hyperventilating. A nurse was there and warned me that I would pass out if I couldn't get my breathing under control. I felt so dizzy.  I knew I would be scared but I didn't think it would come over me like that and manifest in such an extreme reaction. After that, all day, I've felt so embarrassed and ashamed and scared. I feel like  I can't go through with this sometimes and I just keep hoping in the back of my mind that I'll just magically drop dead any day now. I'm not suicidal and won't hurt myself or the baby, but I can't help but to think about how great it would be if I were never born in the first place or if my existence could just be erased.

Today, I just wanted to feel normal again. I hate how my body looks. I feel hopeless, depressed, and scared when I feel the baby kick which is often. I feel like I can't tell my husband this because he's so excited about it and I feel like a failure as a wife and future mother. Why can't I just be happy? I don't know what to do.

I feel like I don't have any hobbies to distract myself from my depression because I'm depressed. I usually just feel tired and drained all of the time because I'm so sad and it takes all my energy. Lately since I've been on X-Mas break I've been trying to paint because I used to love art but it's been so long since engaging in these activities because of my depression that I feel like I'm no longer talented enough to make something I'm proud of. My artistic hobbies that I used to love and enjoy seem to have become stressful pain points. I've tried so many times to find a therapist who will accept my insurance and I've had no luck. At this point, I feel like medication is my only option and I'm so afraid of going that route. 

How can I cope with hitting such a low point?"

sure, it is easy for one to say “go seek help if you think you are depressed” but do you know how hard it is to open up to people? because all these thoughts consisting of “what if people think i'm an attention-seeker?” or “what if i'm annoying them?” or even “i don't want to burden them” are what concern us the most. the fear of being labelled as an annoyance and a burden by the people around us terrifies us. 

a friend of mine also points this out: you could also say “God exists, He loves you so don't be sad” but at the end of the day we are all human beings with feelings, and we are bound to feel sadness at some points of our lives. just because we trust in God doesn't mean that we are not allowed to feel sadness. at the end of the day, we are only human. we can only trust in Him that our days will be better, not that we are not allowed to feel sad. 

i'm tired of seeing certain people shade potentially depressed or depressed people in a negative manner, telling to stop ranting on social media, no matter how “supportive” they clarify their intentions to be. scratch that, you're only making it worse. not everything can be easy, depression surely isn't, and not all people are God-believers. 

instead, help us with words that do not hurt. do not ridicule them for being who they are, for suffering from something they didn't ask for in the first place, but have mercy, show them love, and help them mend their broken spirit.

kmx5hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kmx5hu/i_think_ive_found_my_answer/,I think I've found my answer!,2,0,1609311000.0,"To start off, I should say, if you'd want to talk to me out of whoever else posts for some reason, then hey I'd (maybe) welcome it, I'm essentially another loner with an unhinged perspective. But, I'd at least say to skim through the post so you can get a primer on my brand of crazy before you invite it in for conversation. Oh, and if you're dying for a tune, put on **the** Eva song, the one from the end. Because that's what I listened to while writing this here diatribe of nothingness, and I may or may not want you to feel a little of my pain beyond reading this sham of a post. There is a bar of entry, and know that I will not be a kind soul.

The epiphany didn't come to me until earlier today, though trust me it isn't anything great and I'd just as soon give it up because there's no point to anything. But hey, something I can hold on to in these last moments of the worst year in my known memory. So, before I spill the answery-beans in a minute, a minuet background sequence of opinion!

*I am probably anti-everything you're pro for, and pro for anything you're against - I'm definitely not being sarcastic with italics to show my pain through sarcasm.* Nahh but I'm in a mood to fight so I'm just gonna hate everything being said, even hating what I'm saying because that's *principle* for ya. Humanity is garbage and I hate it. But then again I kinda have to love it, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to tolerate this many years of life. But it's like 80% hate, 20% idk lol. It is objectively horrible.

The way it looks to me, and depending on your perspective and how far you'd twist it to see what I'm seeing... humanity will always live to die. ""Well that's not innovative."" You'd be right in saying that. Even if we make cures for ailments, if we abolish aids, if we ship the 'rona off to mars, even if we start to live longer, it's only so that we'll die easier at some point down the road. We've gone from coal mines with black lung death taking... idunno like a few months to a year to die of in worst cases? We went from that, to zoom zoom wimp electric 20ton cars that we then take and zoom zoom right into a concrete electric pole headfirst and start singin with our angels, that's a hell of an advancement! We only advance as a species so that we'll die easier.

So! That brings me to an idea inspired by the song at hand, from the material, even though it wouldn't make sense to anyone else but me! So! ! If we evolve, change, improve (?), only to die easier, then I may or may not make it my goal to help in that effort, more than indirectly! Now that's a silly thing to say, if you connect those simple dots, but I really don't mean anything by it besides I might actually be inspired to pursue the innovation of technology now! But I won't get there because of a lazy bastard's legacy anyway. But it's an answer! A new purpose for me to have, to live and aspire to create and innovate, just for the spite of how doing so will make life worse in some way going forward!

I just had some nice words at the end of this for those who'd maybe cared to see them. What you see are the words of someone who will fail with no exception. Seriously, don't underestimate how powerful a motivation can be found in the feeling of spite, despite being a double edged sword. And, now, try to stop reading the nonsense from cowards like me and anyone else here, and try to look forward to 2021 not being as abjectly revolting as 2020 has proven to be. Live your life the way you'd see it through and get what peace you can manage without ruining it for anyone else."

I'm even relearning permutations and combinations (like 8th grade math) for a certification exam and it's just a pain, like pulling teeth. I don't even know if I can pass this stupid exam. I'm just not here for it right now. 

Where is my brain? Why can't I think? What happened? Is there just a lump of meat in my head made of cotton candy? Am I gonna be stuck like this forever? How do I possibly take care of anything (like a kid some time in the future) if I can't even think? Why won't any information stick?

• OCD
• bipolar depression
• Generalized anxiety disorder
• some sort of personality disorder (honestly there’s a bunch that I could have, I’m not sure which one it actually is! lol)
• bulimia
The cherry on top is that I’m also a closeted flaming f*ggot too lmao

This year has just wrecked me and I feel stuck. Believe me when I say I’d love to see a therapist, but I believe I need parental consent?

I’m too ashamed to ask for help. I don’t know how my parents would react. Sometimes I feel like this would be easier if I was suffering from at least one illness. My boy has depression? Send the kid to therapy and make him down some pills, that’s fine. My boy is dealing with all this shit?... what the fuck?

It also doesn’t help that I’m pretty much great at hiding it. It’s easy for me to go from a sobbing mess to the family clown in a matter of minutes. I’ve been doing it for years.

Showing any vulnerability is just so terrifying to me. We’re not exactly a family that talks about our feelings. In fact, I’ve never told a single soul about any of this. (Besides mrs. Reddit of course!)

Don't know really why, but from time to time I become aware of it.
It makes me feel sad and alone.
Don't know if it's because how they treat me (one on one), the awkward silences, or that whenever I say something, half of the times, they don't answer.

It's a feeling I can't shake once I pick it up.

{ I know this sensation it's related in a large extent to social anxiety, only bc I'm analyzing it:
 I feel like that, because they are indeed treating me different to the rest, because I'm behaving ackwardly:
- I spent most of the time in silence (I go full introvert),
- After becoming aware of this, I try to chit chat (But as I didn't pay attention, it falls flat. Sometimes I don't even know what to say and I stay silent).
Instead of becoming aware that I'm projecting my uncomfort on them, I get more awared of their discomfort; which makes me overthink the situation (and stay silently), making the cycling start again.
Yes, yes. I know, I just have to chill down and do some sort of mindfulness. Stop thinking.
Not so easy, but not so hard either. }

What I don't know how to handle is the shame component.

{ I feel ashamed whenever it happens to me, even if my family knows it. I have no emotional support, although sometimes I receive unsolicited advices.
Maybe this special treatment is another way of support, but it feels like they are only holding out.}

I usually bear it untill I get emotionally numb.

Does it happen to you? How do you handle shame?"

It just pains me too much to think about leaving her, we have like a life together, 7 years is a lot of time, everywhere I look in my bedroom reminds me of her, every song, every book I look at, everything. I just can't understand how in a single night she decided to end a 7 year relationship when everything seemed just fine.

We're trying to talk to see if we can remedy the situation, but to little avail. She seems pretty resolute about her choice and she says she is very sorry for hurting me.

Alas, depression has come to greet me again, after a long time without feeling it. It comes strong and it's brought me down really quick. I slept terribly last night, I don't feel like eating anything, I feel like isolating myself from my family and I don't feel like talking to them, even though it's not their fault, I don't feel like doing anything apart from digging myself into any game that can distract me and I have been constantly thinking that death would hurt much less.

It just sucks to know someone whom you lived happily for 7 years (we had our issues of course, but overall we were happy, and I thought we still were) just decided it should end. With the pandemic, I can't even go for a walk, so I'm stuck here suffering."

  P.S. : I know other people have had a lot worse than I did growing up or even probably still do but this is my experience please be mindful c
     

      So I’m a19yr old, who hates their dad. My dad was never really around growing up. He travel a lot for his job so he would usually be in town for a day or two at most. The only time where he would pay attention to me was when he grounded me or told me how dumb and useless I was. Anytime I would show emotion he would get angry. If I even shed one tear he would scream at me. I could never be around my mom when he was around. He would get furious if I tried getting her attention away from him. 
     In my early teens years my dad started to get my mom to tag along with him while he travel leaving my brothers and I behind at home. Eventually my dad had to moved a few hrs away for work and my mom, older brother ,and I stay behind. 
        At the same time my dad had promise my aunt that him and my mom would care for my two younger cousins for a year while they went to school here. But thing is that my dad realized he need my mom to go live with him bc he needed someone to cook and clean for him. So originally, plan was for my mom to look after my cousins and make sure they did well in school but it led to me doing that as a freshmen in high school. I was never asked to do this it was just expected of me to do so. 
      my older brother wasn’t around much bc he was a full time college student and employee.  So he wouldn’t check up on me or let alone my parents to make sure I was doing well in class or even if I was going to school at all. I had to do all the cleaning and cooking at home on top of taking care of those two kids. I almost never had time to sleep nor eat. I had to constant clean and cook food for everyone. 
     Every time my parents visited us my dad would point out anything and everything I did or did not do correctly. I almost fail freshmen year bc I couldn’t keep up with school work. My dad made me drop out of softball and marching band bc he said those were unnecessary distractions and that I needed to be at home. I finally had enough with everything and had a breakdown and begging for my mom to come home and stay with me but my dad just told me how ungrateful and selfish I was. I was ruining everything for them. No one will ever want me with me if I had that attitude. My mom didn’t say a word to me for days. 
      Since then I never complained about the situation. I bottle up all my emotions never letting anyone in. I started to develop severe anxiety and depression. After a while we all started to live together again but I soon realize my parents were only looking after my brothers. My parents never checked on me if I was doing well in school nor personally. Only time they talk to me was when i did something wrong or to tell me my brother was better than me. 
     Fast forward to me being in college now being extremely independent from my parents, they are now trying to get involved in my personal life. My mom is a lot more welcoming and warm than she was in my younger years. Yet I constantly have to remind my dad about basic things he should already know bc his my parent. He doesn’t remember what college I go to let alone my major. He doesn’t remember that I’m vegetarian nor that I have food allergies. 
      Literally he doesn’t remember the bare minimum. Yet he manages to remember every detail of my brothers childhood and such. It is a known fact between my parents that I have severe anxiety but my dad says I’m just acting out bc I’m a spoil brat. But at the same he drops everything for my brother whenever he shows any signs of distress. 
     It is painfully obvious that my brother is my dad favorite while my other oldest brother is my moms. Which leads to me being left out all the time. Yet both my parents have informed my it is my job to look after them whenever they get a bit older not my brothers apparently. I have so much anger built up from being emotionally abandoned from a young age to being constantly gaslighted, etc. 
     I just don’t know how to deal with this anger that appears every time I’m near my dad. I honestly only feel pure raging anger towards my dad. Nothing more. I don’t care at all for him cMy old therapist said to me that maybe me being emotionally abandoned at a young age led me to become an independent adult and just maybe I should be thankful for it. I need advice for this pain to go away for  once."

Most of my friendships over the years have ended, and I really am seeing less and less of a point in actually investing in friendships. There's no point, they all leave. I started to push away everyone, I disappear from my friend group often now without saying, I have been signed out of my friend group's chat on my phone for the past month now, I feel distant from my family, and now even myself as I've done everything to stop reminding myself of who I am, I never was honest with people in the first place as I find less of a reason now. There is not a single person I trust enough anymore to even just tell that I'm feeling bad.

Looking through my Xbox and discord friend lists, I can see all the past friendships I've had appear as someone on that list. Everyone who left. I don't see the point anymore. I purposefully denied the chance of being friends with a new person who entered our friend group, because I knew (and 3-4 months later I was right) that she would just leave us. And while everyone else suffered, I was perfectly fine knowing I had lost nothing from her falling out. Its a lot easier this way.

It is kind of difficult to leave the friends I have for years right now, but I've been leaving them temporarily, they're going to eventually get used to me being gone. Because some day it'll be permanent."

Not that I would be that social anyway.

So, since I'm alone here most the time, I have a lot of time to think, which I figured out isn't a good thing for me. Everytime I have too much time and start thinking about me and my life it feels like I have dissapointed everyone who kind of likes me, that everything I begin will end much more messed up than before.

I like doing very different things, a lot of things, but it always feels like I'm not able to do any of them properly. There will be always this one project I can not finish for any reason, and I will always look at the people who get their shit done and feel bad for me not being able to do that.

I'm feeling split inside, I kind of developed multiple personalities over time, and thats scaring me. It feels like sometimes I have no control over myself, while on other days, I'm motivated as hell. Result always is the same: Something somebody else would have done 5x better and faster.

The real problem is, all this is making me trying not to think too much, distracting myself from all those thoughts with Games, YouTube, Netflix etc, which makes me even less productive.

I think i wish to have the possibility again of having more social contacts, which is paradoxical, because I now that I wouldnt use this chance and still would be sitting here most of my time.

Thats only a little part of whats going on inside my head, but I'm not able to explain everthing. It was hard enough to find the right words for this text.

I dont know if thats depression, schizophrenia or something completely else, but sometimes (much more often recently) it just feels like my head is exploding."

That I'm going to have to see all my older siblings and family die, and then eventually myself, unless I kill myself or some tragedy happens. The entire celebration I just wanted the day to be over, from the second I woke up it was one of my first thoughts, and it stuck for the rest of the day.

I feel as if I should just kill myself now. Tonight. Prevent from feeling the pain later on. Tonight is the perfect time. It already feels like everything's concluded on my birthday, I had one last bittersweet ending, no need to renew for another season. But for some reason, I stick around. Logically, everything is saying I should kill myself, and I agree. But dying isn't the scary part, it's the uncertainty of what happens after, and that's where I hesitate. I just wish I could know beforehand, because honestly its a terrifying thought. 

I wouldn't tell anyone before I killed myself, because if I fail, it simply becomes a ""boy who cried wolf"" situation, where every failed attempt becomes less and less severe, until it feels as if they don't care. Maybe they *want* you to kill yourself, and I've already been claimed as an 'attention-seeker' for a similar reason, for attempts I *did* take."

kmut7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kmut7h/the_struggles_of_wanting_to_get_better_but_facing/,the struggles of wanting to get better but facing emotional numbness and memory loss,3,1,1609301946.0,"\*tw: depression, self harm, suicidal thoughts, abuse, alcohol and drug use. these subjects are more symbolically alluded to than directly (nothing detailed) but i feel anyone with sensitivities to them should get a heads up. i’m not currently suicidal, this is just a recent short journal of my experiences with depression, trauma/other abuse. also have never been exposed to electro shock therapy or lobotomies, referenced these only for the symbolism\*

explanation: 24, F. i’m in treatment for the 5th? time for depression, anxiety, experience w trauma. this is only my second time being medicated (was on some low dose Prozac for a year when I was 15-16) am on 50mg Zoloft now and probably gonna ask to go up. was diagnosed this summer with Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, and PTSD and Dr. & therapist said possibly borderline and/or an anxious attachment style and/or avoidant personality type. i feel like i’ve been depressed and had an anxiety disorder most if not all of my life, but both would get very severe after experiencing a new trauma/going through an unwarranted change. Dr said when i was a teen I had situational depression with anxiety because these phases of it getting bad and then kind of fading. I’ve never had manic episodes and my depression being exacerbated always was due to something ‘situational’/explained. because i agreed it felt like things would get better over time and if this or that hadn’t happened i wouldn’t be so depressed, i treated medication as situational too and just told myself i’d ‘make myself get better/pull myself out of it’. but i’m just now starting to realize these phases are recurring and will probably always happen to me when life throws something new/traumatic at me and i obviously can’t control what life has in store, so i’m exploring the idea of staying medicated indefinitely which is honestly kind of scary to me. i never wanted to ‘rely’ on meds, and because i didn’t go very high or stay on long before i thought why bother bc they barely made a difference. but i’m going to give it a thorough chance and actually try to talk to my doctor about it and what i still need help with (daily/short term motivation is the HARDEST thing for me currently). the problem is for the past 2 months maybe I’ve started experiencing the emotional blunting everyone talks about which is interesting because i’ve been very lucky to have little to no other side effects since starting the Zoloft in July. and this is another issue i’m kind of coming to terms with, i don’t REALLY want to be numb most of the time, but maybe it is a better alternative for me if that keeps me stable rather than on shaky ground and crumbling every time there’s a change. the past year or so even before i started the medication, my recent and long term memories have been slowly fading, and now being on the zoloft it seems rapidly getting worse. i’ve heard that both prolonged untreated depression AND medications like zoloft can affect your memory, so, uh, great. my goal was to not feel as torn up about things i can’t control, not to completely forget what i did on recent holidays or what someone told me a month ago. SO this is my experience and i wrote a little poem/song lyric about my mental health struggles that I thought other people could relate to, especially people on medication that causes that emotional numbness.

kmumem,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kmumem/just_stuck/,Just stuck,1,0,1609301243.0,"Buckle up, I’m going to unload. It’s a throwaway. I’m high and this is a brain dump in hopes of help.

I am in my early twenties and a little behind on normal time frame for graduating college. I am not really that upset about that, as I am already doing okay in a job in cyber security. I don’t make a ton of money as I’m more of a junior position. I want to advance in my career but I can’t ever find the discipline to actually study.
I live in a rural southern area and I am politically left leaning.

My depression started in college, which has been an uphill battle the entire time. I went from small town high school where everyone blew smoke up my ass about being smart only to realize how many challenges college had for me. I fell into poor sleeping habits staying up doing class work, not to mention balancing it on top of full time work. I’m doing well in a decent public college with a 3.4ish GPA.

I had previously been diagnosed with depression earlier In college and began taking sertraline, which I took for a month and couldn’t bring myself to go back to the doc. I started smoking marijuana in October of 2019 and it quickly became a daily habit. The pandemic has only made this a worse issue. I smoke every day as soon as I get home just to relax and feel normal after the stress of work. This often causes me to procrastinate on everything else including homework. I’ve made it this far though.

My health over college has declined and I have been aware the entire time. I initially didn’t care since my social life was doing well at the time. Lately I just feel unattractive, uninteresting, and completely stuck. I have cooking significantly more recently since I bought a small house in a small town. Prior I used to eat mostly frozen food and takeout. I still eat a significant amount of fast food/takeout. Probably 7-8 times a week. I am a 5’11 180lb male so I am not obese but definitely not a thin build.

I desperately want to be successful in my career and I have giant ambitions but I just cannot find the motivation to do it. I want to be the best there is in my industry and be a notable figure in the community, but I just can’t bring myself out of my slump of smoking weed and staying cramped up in my house watching YouTube all day.

If I’m not pissing my time away watching YouTube I am playing Xbox alone, I’m discord with some friends, or mindlessly scrolling the internet. I feel like if I was more productive I would be happier, but I just can’t will myself to be productive or I feel as though I lack the planning, coordination, and discipline I need at this point.

Currently on second diagnosis of depression but this time with anxiety. I take two medications for each, but missed going back to the doc again. I’m just back in my old cycle. How can I get myself out of my rut?"

But the issue is that I don’t know what’s causing this stress and depression. I can’t pinpoint why I’m feeling this way.

I’ve been depressed in the past, but right now I feel like I’m at rock bottom. I’m scared and confused, but I don’t know why, and every time I try to explain something, even if it’s not related to me, I stumble twice as hard as I usually do, and I say the wrong things. It’s gotten to the point where it’s affecting my ability to draw and write and be creative. I love drawing and writing. But for some reason I’m not as good as I was about 1 month ago. Something has happened and I’m really scared.

Not to mention the constant nightmares about random subjects. I feel like I’m going to wither.

Jobs in Mexico are horrible, and with no special skills or a finished career, there's nothing I can do to get a well-paid job. The best-paid jobs are related to English interpreting, and as you can notice, I'm not that good speaking  English, so I can't get that kind of job.

I just want some help, if that’s okay? I’m a 22M and I’ve always grown up and thought I was an average looking guy maybe around 4-6/10. It hasn’t helped the fact that I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was 15 due to death of family, social surroundings etc... It was pretty bad with the self harming and suicidal thoughts, however I started to feel more confident in myself due to being around new people and this was when I started at a new college/sixth form (education place for 16-18 year olds before uni) this really did help with my mental health and I felt like maybe I wasn’t so much of the average guy maybe I was a bit more attractive and this was supported by female opinions at the time which I basically never had any encounter with females. I felt during the ages of 17-19 I felt good and positive about myself, I started dressing myself well, I started growing facial hair and my feeling with my appearance really did reflect on my mental health and how I was feeling during that time. However, I feel like I have just let myself go since I’ve been at university, I’ve gained more and more weight every year since I’ve been here and it’s took away any form of confidence I had in myself, I just eat bc I’m bored and there’s no one really to tell me I can’t do it so I will keep going. There’s moments I don’t think about myself and live my life but almost everyday I have hours or even days where I feel numb and disgusting at myself for what I become and it makes me feel like I’ve let myself down and I’m not good at keeping to anything. It seems like it’s just reflected on to everything else in my life, my lack of sleep, my lack of motivation to do anything, constant stress... I really do feel like mental health is affected by how I feel about myself internally and externally ( I don’t know if that’s stupid or not) but I just want a change and I know I want change but I can’t get myself to do it. I want to lose weight whether it be small progress or not I just wanna see some sort of progression in my life as I feel like I’m just drifting by everything right now."

I need some suggestions of how I can keep her motivated and moving while I am at work so she doesn’t feel bad about herself come the end of the day.

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety/depression and I’ve also been medicated since I was in elementary school (I’m 20 now). I am currently living away from home. I’ve been a gamer for pretty much my whole life. I spend my days doing school, gaming, and sleeping. It only recently dawned on me that my gaming might be holding me back.

At the time of writing this I am visiting my hometown and my plan was to bring my gaming rig with me but I forgot my charger. So now I am basically stuck in my thoughts with nothing but my bed and my phone. I have hung out with a few friends from home who are also in town, but it takes so much effort to get out of bed and hang out with them. It fucking sucks because I miss them all so much but it is so difficult just get out of bed. I have succeeded a few times, which is good, but I realized that without something to keep my mind distracted with, I spiral into a depressive state very quickly. 

I recognize that this is without a doubt a very valuable learning experience at the least. With all of my social interaction being almost exclusively through online gaming, interacting with people face-to-face is a source of anxiety. It is usually very hard to get myself to go to social gatherings with friends, but once I force myself to go, the anxiety usually goes away once I start catching up with old friends. 

Sorry that this was not very cohesive. There isn’t really a ‘main point’ to this post. I guess this is just me jotting down what I’m feeling and maybe seeing if anyone has any advice or is going through something similar."

I am 17, and i already know there is people in here who has more serious troubles than those ""youth misadventures"", but I am really feeling bad for months now. Here's the thing, I always struggled socially-speaking, never had many friends and my family lately had financial difficulties. Btw i lived my social life almost normally, because I met a friend in Middle school (1 year older) that brought me into his group (i lived in a small and isolated town, i was the only ""outsider"" of the group) and acted always as a brother. Time went on and I never had any trouble with him or the other guys. In High school I meet this girl and I instantly fall in love with her, unfortunately for me friendship is all she wants, and at the end we became best friends too. We had also many, many, many arguments but we always worked things out. The thing is, my middle-school friend always showed interest in her, mostly in a sexual way (he considered her like crazy so he didn't want any relationship), anyway the two of them never really spent time together, they just known the existance of each. Everything started to go downhill at July, cause me and the girl had a serious argument because i talked about my feelings and how i wanted to end friendship with her because i couldn't keep feeling bad every day, and we stopped talking to each other. In september me and my middle-school friend were together with the group, and he shows me that he texted on Instagram my ex best friend, and refused to show me any of the messages. It was the guy sitting next to him that told me what he wrote; he basically started to say really, really bad things about me just to have a conversation starter but, with my surprise, the girl just said good things about me and said to him that she is not interested in him. I felt orrible, just wanted to go home and drown and never wake up. Not only my lifetime friend was a son of a bitch, I also treated the girl in an orrible way in July and she still said only good things about me. I stopped talking to my middle-school friend, and then after a month worked things out with the girl. During school time things weren't really bad, but now i can't find a motivation to wakr up in the morning. I'm in love with her again, the only thing that I want is to be with her and I know for sure that it will never happen, plus I basically haven't any friend to hang out with anymore. I just have the girl (and i am sure we are not even half as close as we were 9 months ago, and god knows how sorry i am for that) and a guy from school that moved here recently (and god i'm glad he did, he's like the only one that make me distract from the everyday shit). And don't even get me started on school, all the pressure that my parents make on me is absurd and my school is really hard. I like to think that is just a really black period, but what if it's not? what if I've got to spend the rest of my life unhappy? Why do I have to be so much in love with that girl even if she explicitly said that there will be nothing that way between us... I know for most these are the ""golden years"", so my best time is really like that? I just pass my days overthing now, how can i really find myself? how can i be happy when the person I know is perfect for me doesn't want to even give us a chance in our best years together.."

But sometimes, sometimes I have dreams where I'm happy. Sometimes in my dream, I realise it can't be real but my subconscious convinces me that this time it is real and it makes it all that harder to accept when I wake up.

Sometimes when I wake up, it takes me a few moments to realise the dream wasn't real, that I'm not happy and I dont live in the situation in my head that is the root of my happiness. 

Sometimes I cry uncontrollably when I wake up and realise. Tonight is one of those nights. I wake up heartbroken again, and the tears silently stream down my face for while; I'm unable to stop them. 

My SO doesnt understand. He asks me whats wrong but I know he's tired of the answer so now I've just started saying that I dont need a reason to be sad and sometimes I just am.

I guess I just want to put some thoughts I have about trying to find the source of my chronic depression. I guess the reason I’m thinking this now is I watched the new Pixar movie last night ‘Soul’ and it was a bit more introspective than I’d expect from a kids film. Anyhow it was another reason that got me thinking about what I want from life and why I feel I never found my true calling. For the longest time I thought that I got depressed and thus I lost my interest and my one true desire and passion in life. But for the last year or so I think that maybe that’s not the case and maybe my depression partly stems from my obsession with finding that one thing that will make truly happy in life, a panacea if you will for all my problems. I’m very displeased with my life as is and I always chase that one thing that will make me happy and I obsess over it. Anyways I guess the point of this post is to maybe see if anyone else has freed themselves from this constant strive to find that unattainable goal and the happiness it comes with. Maybe I’m meant to put more effort into enjoying the little moments in life and not be so hard on myself. I dunno but that ‘what’s the point in all this’ is just lingering always."

Some days I can’t get anything done, I barely get out of bed. Other days, I can be productive, but after every good half hour of working or accomplishing a small task, I get this feeling of terrible sadness and hopeless instead of feeling good about it. 

It’s not the idea that I should have done this earlier or been doing it all along or that I still have so much to do, it’s more of an existential sadness, that it’s all meaningless or no matter what I do, life will always be terrible/difficult/painful. 

It completely derails me and sometimes I just go to bed early because I can’t seem to get past the feeling. It subsides by the morning, but will randomly pop up during the day. 

Is there anything I can do to manage or cope with it instead of shutting down?"

I was sexually abused, raped, beaten, sexually assaulted, and neglected for three years by my cousin who was a teenager at the time. I’m currently in a legal battle regarding it. I told people who I shouldn’t have, so literally everyone my high school knows, I’ve gotten into fights because I get bullied for it. 50 flashbacks a day, sleep paralysis every night, self hate, self doubt, depression, disgust, confusion, shame, everything. I’ve felt it and still do. I tried hanging myself about two months ago, failed, and tried slitting my own wrists, failed at that too but I was close hah. I’ve attempted to kill myself 5 times now. I was taken to the hospital and stayed there for a week or so. There are several rumors that I lied about my trauma and am pressing charges just for money. My court case is going awfully, my life is shit.


So yesterday... I remember one crucial thing. A camera. He filmed it. Guess what that means? Not only did my cousin use me like that while I was there, he filmed it so that memory would cement in his mind and he could get off on me again and again. “Oh I’m not babysitting Christian today? I’ll just pull up the tape from yesterday”... Knowing that there’s most likely pedophiles that have used *me* to get off makes me feel gross and I fucking hate myself.

There’s no fucking light at the end of the tunnel. The abuse started when I was fucking 8 man. And now my parents are pissed at me because every time I get asked a question on the stand I break down crying or get too confused and then it looks like I’m lying...

I’ve tried overdosing, slitting my wrists, almost jumped off a roof but I’m too much of a pussy, and I’ve tried hanging myself 3 times... why can’t I just get it right bro?"

I’ve been depressed for years, mainly because of my parents, I feel super suffocated around them, like I can’t be myself. But it also doesn’t help that I don’t have many friends, and the few that I do have never really treated me like how they treat each other, I always just felt like an extra.

I thought getting away from my parents would help, but not like this. I was looking forward to them moving down south and leaving me here, but I was hoping they’d leave me the house I’ve lived in the past 20 years. Shortly after Covid started I did something I never do, and I sat down and asked them for a favor. I nicely asked them that considering the circumstances, I understand that they want to move, but with everything going on, it would be nice if I could have the house because they finished paying off the mortgage, so it would have been a nice safety net to have while I try looking for a job.

When I talked to them they were like, “oh of course! Having the house will totally make this easier!” As you can tell from the title....they did not. A week after I talked to them, they decided they “needed” money to renovate the new house, and even though I, and a few friends recommended they hold on to the house and rent it later on, they ignored it all and went ahead trying to sell it. After months of me hoping they’d give up, the sale happened right before Christmas. I went down the the new place with them for a few days because I just had to be a good son one last time.

The reality of the situation didn’t actually sink in until I came back to my home town, but instead of going to the house I miss, I’m sitting in an apartment they got me that I had no say in. Maybe I shouldn’t be complaining since they’re gonna cover the rent until I find a job....but I’ve been ugly crying for over an hour because this’ll never be home, I just want to go home."

I fail at everything I do. I feel like I was only made to consume, not to produce.

I'm unable to interact with society. I have nothing to offer.

I'd like a girlfriend but I am mentally and emotionally unstable and physically inactive, so I don't even try to pair up for her sake. I am attractive and I feel like that's all anyone likes about me.

My parents don't know how to deal with me. My older brother has disappeared, he doesn't keep in contact with any of us.

My parents are devout Christians, and missionaries. We're moving again in 6 months.

Right now I'm living in my hometown for the first time in 3 years, and I don't really connect to anyone. I'm not funny or smart enough to maintain friendships.

I am ambitious but I have no energy to do anything. I feel like even breathing is hard, which is probably due to asthma.

&#x200B;

Really all I even care about anymore is music. Not talking about music, just listening. I play guitar but I'm just average. My younger brother is like a piano prodigy, and he's really good at drawing and art. People are always talking about him, and it makes me hate myself for not having anything impressive.

People like my exterior, but once I show my inside, everyone, and I mean everyone hates me. No one likes a depressed teen. Even I don't like people my age.

My parents withdraw when I try to open up. Or misunderstand. Or give irrelevant advice.

And I get depressed at the same time every day. I have no idea why. In the morning I'm fine. At the end of the day I feel like a complete failure.

I learned to read at a very early age and I was considered a genius child, and now I'm a below-average teen who is working through 7th grade math.

I'm trying (and failing) to learn Japanese, because I want to understand those pretty symbols.

I try to write music reviews, but they bore me, and others hate them. Same goes for books.

Having to get a job and potentially going to college sounds like a nightmare.

I feel like I have multiple identities, and no true self.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't want to live anymore but I'm scared of hell and the effect it will have on my family. I don't even think I want any advice because this pain feels better than nothing. I feel like I'm going to stay single and listen to music until I starve, while I watch people on the internet accomplish their goals since they were blessed with talent and motivation. LOL, good for them.

I just want to be kissed and fade away into eternal bliss. To not have to worry about anything, or feel anything."

Every guy I dated since then crushes on him and it makes me lose my mind. (All online dating thats how everyone knows everyone)

He treated me poorly back then which ofc, since my self esteem was low, thought was his way of showing love, bc he's so confident and takes what he wants bla bla.

Imagine everyone you date secretly wants to get fucked and loved by your ""(emotional) abuser"" (i know that's a hard word but it's not far from truth but i don't wanna go into details and make this an essay). I don't know how to handle this.

It's not all in my mind I'm not imagining this. It usually comes up once I check who my partner follows on instagram/facebook and ofc it's always him. (They literally follow him on Facebook, like not friendship just following them to see what he's up to lol)

Im literally only barely not killing myself while he is like this shining star that everyone wants in their lives. I guess thats ok and I need to focus on myself etc but it has left this huge scar inside me and I don't know how to cope with it. Thx for reading :)"

Most of the time when this happens I will just stare somewhere at nothing in particular and this feeling will just take over. And I start thinking very philosophically, with thoughts like: Is living worth it, why would I want to live, what's the meaning of life and what am I worth often crossing my mind. Sometimes it's also just these feelings.
But today I had one again, and it crossed my mind that Maybe I don't want to live anymore. I have had this thought a couple time prior, but never really did it, suicide. I didn't do it this time either, otherwise you couldn't read this, but I just don't see the point to living anymore. There are fun moments, but the mayority of the past years have just been valueless without any meaning. The only reasons to not kill myself are that my family and friends have to deal with me having committed suicide and possibly feeling guilty about it and blaming themselves for it."

Wanting more, wanting a little shimmer of positivity.
But, all I get is to feel like a background actor in someone else's dream.

No one in my family supports my dreams,
They act like they're stupid. 
Except they support my siblings dreams.
I'm different from literally any one that is physically near me in any way.
I have never had friends. I've always been 'that kid' 
Who just awkwardly stands by
And doesn't do anything.

The only thing i have is music.
But I feel like I'm never going to be good enough to succeed.
Its such a competitive arena.
And I'm not original.
I'm just me.
But Apparantly my entire personality sucks.

My parents keep threatening me. Because i don't have a job.
They even kicked in the door to my room
Which is my safe space.
And, now i have to keep a dumbbell in front of it. 
Or it'll just swing open.

I just don't feel like part of this family 
I don't feel like part of this earth
I'm alone
But Everyone is
So there's just one more way I'm not special."

They look very pretty and often remind me of memories in my past. But they also exaggerate my depression, not for the nostalgia but for the fear that I'm missing out.

Whenever I look west at a sunset, I always imagine someone at that part of the world where the sun is shining beautiful, people are at a beach or at a rich house throwing a party with all there friends listening to music, drinking, have a blast, having a lot of sex, and full filing fantasies I don't believe I'll ever fulfill. It's almost like a metaphor for my inner fantasies about life. 

It makes me feel so lonely like I'm missing out. Obviously that isn't always happening especially with the weather and Covid but my mind wants to imagine there is something like that going on.

And as the orange and yellow clouds start turning purple and then dark blue and then the light slowly fades away from the sky turning into night I feel all alone inside. Like the world has left me behind. It makes me want to go to bars or clubs or strip clubs, it makes me want to drink or go gambling, it makes me want scrape whatever fun was left over and left behind for me to enjoy in this world to patch this empty hole I have inside of me that I can never seem to escape.

And then when it's night time after I get back and cried all I have left to cry I slowly drift away into my bed exhausted at this miserable life I continue to live for, I slowly awake everyday with the sun shining on my face to let me know it never left me and that there is hope for me in the future. And then I continue to believe this until the sun goes down again, every single day 

Idk, I'm just writing how I feel right now as I look at it turning from purple to dark blue.."

If you can, please, please just share any advice that you can. I'm so scared for my friend and I REALLY need advice on what to do.

My best online friend has depression. Recently he's gone on break from all social media; he did this because he was getting stressed out by everything with our friend group, his school work, etc. However he's still been messaging me, telling me that he still feels incredibly depressed. I have been diagnosed with depression, and have went to the hospital for a week after self-harming and planning to commit suicide. I'm a bit better now, but he has had no help whatsoever.

The issue is that he lives in Turkey, and I live in America. He's explained to me that mental health isn't really regarded as much over there, or paid much attention to. He's talked to his school counselor, she ignored him. He talked to his parents, they didn't listen. I've pestered him to try and convince his parents to just listen, because that's how I got help (I had told my mom that I was considering suicide; that's a whole 'nother story of it's own), but he's stubborn and doesn't think it'll work no matter how much I try to talk to him.

He doesn't have a history of cutting or anything like that, but he self harms by drinking coffee with absurd amounts of sugar to speed up his heart rate. He says that this makes him feel like he's going to die, and I'm no medical expert but I'm sure it's not helpful for him whatsoever. He mentions quite a bit that he'd kill himself but he can't because he's afraid of leaving everyone behind. Still, it scares me to no end.

I can't bare the thought of losing him. He's so behind in school, every day is just another day of pain he has to go through. I'm terrified he's just going to disappear one day, because every day he just seems to get worse. Every day I've talked to him and tried to give him advice, he gets better for a while then gets bad again.

I'm desperate here. Please, I need advice."

Towards yourself is one thing, everyone is guilty of that to some extent - perhaps more so if you're on this sub - but towards others in another.

Maybe it's the emotional numbness, the white noise of mental exhaustion that influences decision making when it comes to what *to* and what *not to* say to someone in the moment but I can't shake the feeling that I am a black hole destined to destroy anything and anyone that gets too close. It would be better for people to not care, to not be friends with me because of the way I am. Aware of my own toxicity and seemingly powerless to change it. Its better to push away the people I care about as not to hurt them and impact on their happiness. 

There used to be a showon when I was growing up, I remember I used to stay up late on a Friday night and watch it. I believe it was called ""pushing up daisies"". The main character in that show had the unfortunate power of causing instant death to whatever he touched. But he was a good person so made sure to stay away from those he cares about. Never wanting to get close. I don't remember much More about the plot than that but it is a metaphor for what I'm trying to say above, I think. Stay away from those you care about if you want them to be happy, so you don't hurt them. 

No body seems to get it and I'm just hoping that maybe people on here could relate to what I'm feeling. I'm not looking for advice, really."

It hurts you. Torments you. Rips you apart from the inside. 

Why not confront the source of it? Why not ask for what is really going on? Sure! Let’s do that!

BUT... all you can think is how fucking crazy your logic is. How inappropriate it would be to make wild accusations. How likely it is that someone is lying just to let you hear what you want. 

So you don’t confront the truth. And you’re stuck. Then the anger builds so much that you want to scream these accusations at them anyway. You want to YELL AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS!! FULLY EXPRESS THE GOD DAMNED PAIN AND TORTURE YOU’RE FEELING BECAUSE OF THAT PERSON’S ACTIONS!! SHOW THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’RE BEING TORN FROM THE INSIDE OUT, HOLE IN THE CHEST, OR WHAT HAVE YOU!!! FUCK!! GOD FUCKING DAMNIT MAN!!

But then you think more, and you convince yourself that it’s your fault. Not theirs. 

And so goes the cycle. 

Fuck this. With all of my heart and being, Fuck. This."

She checked out in May, ignored me until August. That's when she finally told me she didn't love me anymore. That we were like oil and water. I had no idea she ever felt that way. I thought things had been going great until she just didn't text me or call me for days, then weeks, and then months. And then she was gone. 

Any life pro tips for dealing with this? Every day has been a struggle with suicide. So many things remind me of her and once one thought comes to mind, they don't stop coming for hours or until I finally distract myself again. Every day is a rollercoaster where I feel okay or miserable, just back and forth all day. I've tried putting myself out there and moving on, but I just feel guilty for trying to be with anyone else. Nobody else makes me happy like she did, I don't know how to make myself happy. It's just distractions. When I'm distracted, I feel fine, but as soon as I get off discord it's back to being alone and miserable. I don't want to have to be distracted all the time. When I'm not distracted all I think about is her, how I miss her, how things could have been different, maybe I should try to talk to her after another month or two, maybe this maybe that. I just can't stop thinking about her and anything relating to her. 

I feel guilty for wanting to kill myself over a relationship. I know that somewhere down the line I can make things better, or I think I can anyways. I could find someone else and rediscover that feeling. But I don't want to be broken if I find that someone. I don't want to be hung up on her for years. I want to be happy again. I just don't know how. I don't want to die but most of the time it feels like that's my only option to stop feeling this way.

I wasn't necessarily happy when we were together. I was still struggling, but she helped me hold on and we supported each other endlessly. Now that's gone.

Making a plan for my future, meeting people however I can given the circumstances, y'know just doing stuff that'll show that I'm young and okay to learn and make mistakes, because that's all apart of the process.

Even if I'm not fully doing it, I should be at the least trying to do the things I'm passionate about, because that's okay too. It's all okay right? 

I can do whatever as long as it's within those vague parameters. But I also feel so... Suffocated and stuck trying to do anything. 

And I know that it's okay not to know exactly, but at the same time I have to be able to do something right?

Time is horrifying like that. I'm young now, but I won't be forever, so I need to make the most of it.

But I'm always anxious. I'm always worried of falling short like I so, frustratingly, often do. It feels like whatever I do is always just treading water, hopelessly trying to do something I feel that I just deep down can't. It's all tough. Trying to find yourself.

There was this girl I wanted to talk to too. We got into the same store since we were both in the same work placement program and she seemed really cool y'know? 

Like she knew what she wanted to do, the stuff she cared about and wasn't afraid to hide any of that, not in an in your face way, but in a really self assured way of just knowing herself. And I just really admired that.

I talked to her once, which went well, but then got far too anxious and just walked away saying nothing but a quick 'hi' the 3 or so times I saw her again. I instantly regretted not doing more or trying harder to get to know her, but it was my first job and it already felt like a lot to take in on it's own.

She since switched her placement, since she did say she didn't like the whole retail thing altogether.

Which I think is kinda' funny to think about. Like if this were a movie, she would've settled there for a while not trying to do anything more, because in movies people aren't always people, they're just waiting on standby for whatever the main plot is to come along. 

But this isn't a movie, so nothing is guaranteed whatsoever, everyone is their own person and that's a good thing. This isn't something I'll talk about and think about again one day in the future only to run into her the next day. I just flat out probably won't see her again. She won't see this one among millions Reddit post, she won't suddenly try and reach out to me on Instagram or anything, I had my chance to know her and I blew it because I was too scared to take a leap, again.

Because life is like that. You meet people, but then just never see them again, because everything always changes, and it's up to you as an individual to embrace that change, otherwise you'll feel stuck and complacent, even if settling into something can be good as long as you feel you care about whatever it is you're doing.

I am glad she's trying to pursue what she feels passionate about. It's why I wanted to talk to her to begin with, because she seems the opposite of whoever it is I am. I might settle into this job and never do anything more, because I'm fine with it and don't know what more to do. 

If I ever do, it always feel coincidental, not because I really took a leap, but just because one day I figured ""Eh, why not?"" and just did something because I wanted to and followed through for once.

I'm just scared of that y'know?

The seeming meaningless of it all. The fact that I can do what I can in a moment or just live to regret it for all the next. 

That happens a lot actually. I think there might not be a single day in my life that I live without regret. Maybe it was the tone of my voice, the words, or my lack of action. 

Every time I talk to someone, the words bounce around in my head, rearranging themselves trying to pick it all apart to see what I did right or wrong leaving me to just feel disconnected. Even if it goes well, it pretty much always happens.

I try to be nice generally, I think people think I'm nice too, either that or just some big anxious oaf, which I'd get too. 

But that doesn't feel enough either. It's good to be opinionated, because it means you're passionate about something. But I find it hard to do that when I feel so often... An outsider to myself, like there's someone doing what I do externally and another thinking my thoughts, and somehow a third that feels trapped in this little bubble I can never seem to break out of.

I don't know. It's all weird. Time is weird, life is weird. It's all... A lot."

Just a bit of a rough day today. Looking over my life, it honestly feels like I ought to kill myself a number of years from now once I get some money and can give it to worthy charities after I die.

I don't particularly care about charities, honestly, I don't particularly care about anyone or anything, but it would be nice to feel a bit of moral justification I think. 

But yeah, I just...don't really think I ought to be here and it seems like it would be best to give resources to others who need them and who aren't broken human beings like me and might be able to have meaningful lives. I'm just tired and passionless. I have achieved nothing and have no particular positive desires. I am alone and fear trying to change that, since people die or leave (or I hurt them, though this is rare). 

Yeah, just some unpleasant thoughts today. I'm not suicidal since, like I said, I'd at least want to wait a couple of years but I'm just not in a pleasant place today. Not really sure what the point of writing this is, just hoping to exorcise the thoughts onto the page I guess."

It makes me sad that there are good people out here in the world depressed and feeling alone when there are people on the other side of the earth wishing to meet a person just like them. Im sad that a lot of depressed people are just guilty of having a big heart and it’s not reciprocated. I’m sad because there are a shit load of awesome people out there who are oblivious to their own awesomeness but will idolize a stranger. It makes me sad that from the time  we all were able to comprehend what we saw on television, until this present day, most of us have subconsciously built a mental jail and feel trapped behind the bars made of other people’s opinions and beliefs. It makes me so sad that somewhere down the line it became not okay to feel anymore, to be human, to have and express our emotions. It makes me sad that vulnerability scares people. I’m sad that some are actually scared of abandonment or rejection when only being true to themselves.  It saddens me that we unconsciously let others chase us away from our authentic selves because they are not comfortable with our truth. We’ve all experienced hurt in some form and would go above and beyond to not to feel it again. It saddens me that we run from the stinging truth. Its saddens me that people are afraid to be free. It makes me sad that we are willing to leave ourselves and attempt to be someone else because most of us were not taught to treat our wounds with  the same love we splurge on everyone else. Instead, we bleed on people who never cut us. A problem we wouldn’t have if self love was promoted nearly as much as hate and fear. It saddens me that having “ haters” is the norm, but if a stranger were to say “I love you,” it’s awkward. It saddens me that we were taught the words “No” and “selfish” were negative things to be and say when in fact, we must do all the things we do for others... for ourselves first! Love, be patient, care, forgive, understand etc. It saddens me that most the world is divided but suffer together. It saddens me that children are being raised by parents that are still hurting from when they too were children. It saddens me that people don’t know that the door to their mental jail  has always been unlocked. It saddens me when they don’t believe me and they stay. 😔"

At any rate, it's been a few years now since I've been dealing with low key depression which I thought for the longest time was just the rigors of life because everyone loves repeating how nobody said life is easy and that's what I must be feeling.    It's sort of like the proverbial frog in the pot of water boiling itself to death.  It started off innocently enough, you think the reason you're not doing things or enjoying things that you once did was simply because you're tired / burned out from work and life in general and that it's just part of life and need to be accepted.   Not completely sure how many years it's been now but a long ass time would be an apt description.   

  
I don't have any friends, family relationships are touch and go mostly toxic and inconsequential; not sure which is worse.   I've also allowed my health to get bad.   I've spoken to my GP briefly telling him how I felt and he prescribed some antidepressants but I was either in denial or wasn't completely ready to take the next step.   I'm still not sure what chemicals would do for me, if I'm honest.  I mean I don't have suicidal thoughts; not to the level that warrants psychiatric intervention but more benign thoughts of not wanting to live if I come down with an illness that will profoundly affect my quality of life, that I'm sure of.   That said, I guess the eureka moment I had was coming across this site:

[https://headsupguys.org/overcome-lack-meaning-purpose/](https://headsupguys.org/overcome-lack-meaning-purpose/)

(so i tried to make it short but it was still really long so imma try again)  basically in times of highschool,i had bad friends. my father was the same. my mom forced me to study so she can brag about me. i have 4 sisters and no brothers (im a guy) . they were somewhat less toxic then other ppl but it was still bad i could hangout with anyway so i was just suffering with the shit i like  
   
 after college my depression doubled. its basically all the previous but without support, i studied college far from home and since im kinda poor it was bad for me, i was even saving to buy a pc so i can play with it, i couldn't do alot, the things i like the most i couldnt do them ,and things i hated where all around me, i was alone and with each day things got worse. i was there for two years and it was really bad. the covid was a good thing that happened to me, my sister found a  job so she was paying internet and my father didnt yell at me as much, i waked up when i want to and played as i like. the first period wasnt that good but these last two months were good. i thought imma move to a new college thats kinda closer and maybe find something. i went there these last days and i absolutely hated it, ppl were worse then before probably since its closer to the shit place i live in, and i was forced to live in a shit place with a shit person and with no internet or good service, i didnt know what to. the ounce of happiness i had last month transformed to hell, it hurt really really really really really bad, i lost all hope, i always knew suicide is the best option to get rid of this suffering but im somewhat a religious person, i think religion is a good thing since it tells you its not the end, so i say if i kill my self im going to hell to suffer more, and idk if im even going to heaven, i stopped doing good things long ago since i hated everyone. so now even suicide is bad thing, im might do it if something bad happen and im just not thinking and im at the right place where i can do it. i thought of getting out of this country but its alot of work and probably i have to do bad things plus i wont be able to get rid of my depression even if i go since i know ppl outside also suffer. i went back home after two days of staying there, my family knows something is wrong but whenever i try to explain they dont get the idea and they dont try to listen but just complain saying that bad shit happen to them to but they laugh all the time i see them happy, i gave up on love, trying to look cool, trying to have expensive shit, and all other stuff.  all i wanted was to stay alone and play games or whatever but i cant even do that, i cant even kill myself.  
I was born to suffer

Color in life is washed out,3,0,1609277121.0,"This heaviness, the dark heavy thing Is pressing against my mind and body. It's washing out the colour in my life, I can't even think positively anymore. I cant even get a small boost of motivation. What is the point for it all. I just want it to end. Another 50years of this? I am out 

But too much of a coward to take my own life. Too much of a coward to face life again, to trust again, to love again , to actually try again. Life has been fucking me for the last 10 years. I thought I could beat it. I thought it will get better, it did  get better but only just to fuck with me again. I was sceptical that a stranger could care about me. I still fell for it. I should have known people just use each other and take advantage of each other. I help people because I know what it feels like to be down and I don't want anyone else to feel it ever. I never expect anything but why do I not even get the basic respect and the basic care. Guess that was the expectation. I care for everyone around me but I cared so much more for her. I hardly knew her but she gave me some colour in my life. I saw how she struggled sometimes and how she handled things so similar to me. I trusted that she will have my back. I thought we could forge a friendship/relationship that would be the envy of others and for a while it was. I started to trust again. I used to make excuses for her and brush things off but I guess I was so desperate for some colour in my life that I lookedpast the signs. Then it all came crashing down harder than before. She got out of her temporary pit and just left me in mine. She got out of her rut and didn't bother to even come back for me. She decided to pretend it never happened. Kicked me further down the pit I was already in. I guess it's true, people don't care for others. I decided to make her happy and care for her because I knew I can never be happy but seeing her happy and just be there for me, made me happy. Seeing her smile, made it worth it. Seeing her not hurt made it worth it.

Just the way she abandoned me. The way she pretends she was never in a rut and she was the one caring for me and I was the burden. Now that things are back to normal, she cut me off. I have never demanded much. I know they cant match the love I pour into it but just some basic care and concern would be nice. Even till now I wish the best for her and that she isn't tormented like me but seems like she doesn't give a single fuck about me. The way she spoke ill of me, feels like she just had to keep crushing me and kick me when I am down. I hardly brought my problems up and my feelings up but the moment I do, she stops listening. Starts to get impatient and leave. 

Was caring too much was a mistake? Now I am a nobody, in fact now she wants me out of her life. Her other friends are back. The ones that were never there when she needed someone. But those people don't have this heaviness with them. She knows I still have it and she doesn't want any part of it. She doesn't know how she is making it worst but she knows I can't be helped out of the pit so she decided to kick me further down. To somewhere far away from her. I could go on and on but I don't have the energy to relive it my head for now. I have been reliving the memories for the last 3 months while she is living her life to her fullest.

Drugs & alcohol don't make happy anymore, they just help pass the time and get me to sleep. Everyday i dread it when the sun rises. Its the hardest part of the day because I know i have a whole another day to get through. The sunset is my favourite  because I know the day has ended and i am 1 day closer to death. 1 day closer to the freedom I crave in death. Will the suffering actually end with death? No one knows. But it beats this. Life has passed me by. 28 years and no achievement worth celebrating. Started at 18 and here I am still waiting for this to end. Patiently waiting but running out of patience. The knives in my heart, the heavy black pressure pressing against me and the fog in my brain all feel too much. 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 I can't even put up an act anymore. Why is life just suffering.  I cant put to use any of the advice given to me. I don't see the point. The cycle of thinking I can beat this and coming crashing down ever single time the last 10 years has finally take a toll on me. I want it to end for good. When I thought how much worst can it get, it has a way of surprising me. Thank you life, for letting me know there is no point in trying. I fall 7 times I get up 8. I don't want to get up anymore. I have fallen too many times and I just don't have the energy in me to get up anymore. The knives in my heart, can they ever be removed so that atleast I won't feel pain but just numbness . I tried working hard and pouring myself into work but no one ever recognises hard work when it is bad work. I make the silliest mistake and I am always overlooked. While those that can bring life to the party and slack around are appreciated. I pour my heart and soul even when it is so hard but nothing ever seems to go right and I am never enough. Give this life to someone else please and take it away from me. 

TLDR: Life sucks and dont trust people when you are depressed, them leaving just sends you down a deeper bigger blacker hole. Live life one day at a time and pray it ends soon

I went to a top college prep school in my area my whole life and was far below average there. I’m going into my second semester of junior year of college but my gpa is less than what I need to maintain my scholarship and school only ever makes me more depressed because never in my life have I ever gotten good grades, and my terrible ADHD doesn’t make anything better. 

My family knows that I have really bad depression issues and I’ve had my ADHD diagnosed twice but they still don’t try to understand that I cannot do what they do because my head is all fucked up. They somehow don’t know how poorly I’m doing and there’s no way I can tell them I’m failing. I don’t want to be here in school or on earth anymore. Being stuck at home with controlling parents only makes me want to cut myself and kill myself more. 

There’s no way they’ll let me drop out but college doesn’t do anything except make me depressed and they’ll never understand that because they want me to have a degree. I don’t even want the degree since I don’t really need one for my field (I’m a film major which is basically a fake major anyway).

But is is what it is 🤪

So i did some reading and imma bout to explain what its like to be like us people who are diagnosed with bpd.


Borderline personality disorder is often misunderstood. It’s time to change that.

Borderline personality disorder — sometimes known as emotionally unstable personality disorder — is a personality disorder which affects how you think and feel about yourself and others.


People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often have a strong fear of abandonment, struggle to maintain healthy relationships, have very intense emotions, act impulsively, and may even experience paranoia and dissociation.

It can be a scary illness to live with, which is why it’s so important that people with BPD are surrounded by people who can understand and support them. But it’s also an incredibly stigmatized illness.

1. ‘We’re scared you’re going to leave, even when things are good. And we hate it too.’
One of the biggest fears we have is people leaving us.There’s this pervasive fear that people will leave us, or that we aren’t good enough for that person — and even if it seems irrational to others, it can feel very real to the person who’s struggling.Someone with BPD would do anything to stop that from happening, which is why they may come across as being “clingy” or “needy.” Though it can be difficult to empathize with, remember that it stems from a place of fear, which can be incredibly hard to live with.

2. ‘It feels like going through life with third-degree emotional burns
Whoever wrote down that point is absolutely right, i go from being a dick to a loving dude in the blink of an eye, it's crazy lmao
My bestfriends would know this one.

3. Everything is felt more intensely: good, bad, or otherwise. Our reaction to such feelings may seem out of proportion, but it’s appropriate in our minds.
Having BPD can be very intense, as though we’re vacillating between extremes. This can be exhausting for both us and for the people around us.

But it’s important to remember that everything the person with BPD is thinking is more than appropriate in their mind at that time. So please don’t tell us we’re being silly or make us feel as though our feelings aren’t valid.

It may take them time to reflect on our thoughts — but in the moment things can feel scary as hell. This means not judging and giving space and time where it’s warranted.

4. We aren’t unlovable and we love big.
When it comes to love we give our all. I know im doing all i can to make the ones i love happy and i hope they realise how much i love them."

Being alive just feels like a constant struggle without meaning. The only thing that keeps me is my codependency. Knowing if i leave i'll hurt those who love me. But tbh it's just not enough anymore. Why live for the sake of others living? It's my life and i've suffered for so long and there's no end in sight. Keep getting up and don't know why. Looking for answers as to what the fuck i'm still doing here or what my purpose is and i'm only met with more reasons to leave lol

Older people who have made it to their 30s and 40s are always saying well you gotta just keep going even though it sucks but can't tell me why. I'm not the type of person who can just accept life as a journey with no direction and i'm guessing you aren't either. I will say from experience joy is a mind state. I've been in really shitty situations in life and still found a way to be happy but that doesn't mean i'm happy here, just a happy person. That being said i think indefatigable optimism is incredibly obnoxious. People always wonder why people who seemed so happy end up killing themselves and i think i just solved their riddle."

Im so blessed to have so many people That i can count on and I know the ones that would never leave me. All these blessings and im still depressed 🤡

This is just a rant, anyway college is hella hectic and i Rarely have time to talk to my bestfriends from school and it kills me. Well tonight I was finally able to talk to two girls who i love so fucking much, really can't imagine my life without them. We talked so fucking much and caught up and yes im glad i had taken some tissues just in case.

Talked about how much we missed school, talked about all those wack moments which were plain ass embarrassing but talking about them now no matter how cringy it is shit really do be memories :')

Really hated school back then and now all i could wish for was to be in my school w my friends, w the ones that give a shit about my life.

Life really is just making different groups of amazing friends as you grow up, and you gotta do whatever it takes to make sure you don't lose certain people.

I really hope my bestfriends know how much i love them cus there's not a day that goes by where i dont think about yall, everything that we do together affects me tremendously.
Y'all know how emotional i am.

If friendship is a big deal for  y'all, ya gotta make sure you wont leave each other no matter what. Being able to vibe w someone even after its been months or years really show how strong that bond is"
kmmzom,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kmmzom/wellbutrinparanoia_extreme_insomnia_dissociation/,"Wellbutrin-paranoia, extreme insomnia, dissociation???",7,9,1609276050.0,"Hello,

I was wondering if anyone was put on wellbutrin for generalized anxiety and depression, and to help with Adhd and motivation? my doctor and I talked and it seemed like the IDEAL drug for all of my issues right now... But after 3 days, trying it two different times in the last couple months I had EXTREME side effects. It has me questioning if I need to be psych tested for more than just anxiety because this has happened to me with just about every SSRI as well, and the reason I tried wellbutrin. Anyway, I experienced extreme paranoia and intrusive thoughts within 3 days each time on 150 mg. On top of that I didn't sleep for 36 hours and still couldn't until I took my clonazepam. It felt insane. I wanted it to work so bad and keep seeing people say that you have to wait out the initial effects but I almost felt like it gave me more anxiety and scary side effects than just taking vyvanse to focus in school, and clonazepam for anxiety and sleep. My doctor has now switched me to an SNRI because he said my side effects sounded a little more extreme than normal, but I can't shake that maybe it would work perfectly for me and help me taper off of benzos and amphetamines in the long run.

Oh, to add. I explained to him the only way to describe the feeling was like mania, or a bad acid trip, because it would last that full 36 hours and I would start to feel dissociated with reality. almost like I was in a dream state. "

I’ve tried killing myself twice so far and the second attempt has left me with permanent damage that will always be a constant struggle to deal with and an ungodly amount of chronic pain that will never go away, not to mention thousands upon thousands of dollars in medical debt that I now have because I somehow managed to fuck my life up even worse than it already was to begin with. I’m almost broke but can’t work just about anywhere because of all the pain I’m constantly in so I have no source of income whatsoever.

I only have one actual friend left since the rest have all stopped talking to me but he’s too busy to hang out with most of the time so it’s rare that we ever see each other anymore. My brother and I used to be close but have drifted further and further apart the older we’ve gotten just because of life. I love my mom but she’s always been incredibly difficult to live with and constantly causes conflicts with all of us in our house. My dad has never really been in my life much at all after the divorce when I was very young unless it was convenient for him so we rarely talk. My 80-year-old grandfather who I love very much was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s this past summer and is slowly decaying to the point where he even forgot my name recently so he isn’t going to be around much longer and there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it.

I’ve never been truly happy for any length of time for as long as I can remember and nothing that I’ve tried has ever worked to correct this, but at least I used to feel like me. Now though, my mental illness has completely destroyed my entire life to the point where I don’t even recognize myself anymore; I’m now just an angry, bitter, hollow husk of who I once was, the person I can never be again because of the constant shitstorm that’s always been my life that I feel like I’ve never had a break from. I genuinely feel like the most miserable person on the entire planet.

This New Year’s though, when the ball drops at midnight, all of the pain and endless disappointment will finally end forever. I don’t care anymore about how my family or singular friend will feel after I’m gone because I’ve spent enough time thinking about that as it is. I’m done practically keeping myself on life support just to make everyone else feel better and lying to myself that everything will just magically get better someday like I’ve thought so many times before only for nothing to happen at all. It’s time to put an end to this utter joke of a life once and for all and just pull the fucking plug.

This time, I’m going to make sure that I get it right. After all, as the saying goes, the third time’s the charm. Goodbye forever."

I don't even know where to start. I've been so numb lately I can't even hold my thoughts long enough to write them down and when I try, they just seem to slip further away. I literally can't think during some times. I'm very lonely. I have a family (siblings + parents, but live on my own) but I've never been close enough with them to talk about anything serious. So that somehow makes me feel even more alone. I have lost touch with all my friends and I only have people at work but none of them are really friends. There's nobody to talk to. I have tried but all it does is make the listener awkward and trying to move on to another subject. I crave for human contact, just anything that makes me feel I'm anything to anyone. Everyone I know seem to have a decent life with goals and people around them. Someone to trust and to lean on. A future. I'm just nothing, I don't matter to anyone and I can never find happiness in myself, I need people. Loneliness just kills me. The one positive thing in my life is my job and even that is ending now. Because of the famous fucking virus I'm losing my job and I have to wake up in 5 hours to the last day there. After that it's just darkness. No light in my future. The one thing where I could talk with people and forget about my hollow, lonely, miserable and unjoyful life. Everyone there seems to think I'm just a joyful, kind and funny guy who's always smiling at work and is so cheerful (because I genuinely loved that job and was better there), but they have no idea that when ever I'm not there I'm just sitting in my apartment, consuming meaningless youtube videos or something and feeling that dull ache of despair in my chest just waiting so I can go to sleep but not actually being able to sleep. I have no intentions of killing myself because I don't want to do that to my family, the only people I love.

In conclusion, I shouldn't exist and I don't want to exist. There is no point in me being here. All I am is just one more addition to the global overpopulation issue. I'm not helping anyone, though I'm not hurting anyone to my knowledge either. Nobody needs me in their life and I'm so fucking lonely and maybe I deserve it. Honestly the best I can describe this is that I'm just an empty shell. I'm a turtle shell with the turtle dead and gone from the inside.

I'm sorry if I wasted your time by making you read this ramble. Also... thank you. For someone to read through that wall must mean someone was for once interested enough in something I do."

I’m living with my partner whom I love but with staying inside so much it makes my mind wander and my head spin and my thoughts go crazy that I’m starting to think I’m purposely pushing him away. I sometimes feel like maybe I make excuses and it is my trust issues (he has broken it once) but other times I feel like it’s me being overly sensitive and crazy. Even my counselor has told me to chill and realize what I have. 

I’m in my second year of college and I’m ready to give up as I feel like I’m going no where and nothings getting better. 

I’m below middle class, live paycheck to paycheck, and I’m just sad. 

I want concerts back, I’m tired of this mask, I want to be around people, I want to hug my grandma. 

I switched medications and so that’s definitely a play in this. 

There’s no point to this other than I’m venting.

There is always something else. Dealt with an illness that threw off my plans of college, when I was just getting onto my feet. I am in deep trouble now. I know I could probably pull myself out of it and get back on the road towards independence and success, but is it even worth the effort? Now I have a leg injury that's preventing me from doing anything at all. There will always be another sickness or injury, something else to throw off all of my plans and dreams. It will never end.

IDK where to post this.,3,2,1609272527.0,"I've always imagined depression as a state of sadness when too many sad events pile up and leave you really messed up. For me its been so different. My brain is fucked for no reason. There is no explanation and its really frustrating. For years I have felt overwhelmingly disconnected. Nothing feels real and I mean nothing. My parents, my dogs, myself, and anything around me. It's so weird and I think I'm beginning to accept it which is not okay. This is not okay. I shouldn't feel like this. Something is wrong. I'm so numb I haven't felt anything in years. I don't feel joy or sadness just a dull sensation of nothingness. There is no reason for me to feel like this it freaks me out because I feel like there is no solution. 

I've been in treatment for six months. I've tried meds, therapy, and I'm even seeing a psychologist to try and figure this out. I'm scared he is going to comet to the same solution everyone else comes to; the internet is the reason for my illness. I tried cutting it out of my life for a month and I felt the same at the end of the month. 

It would be okay if I could still function and feel like this, but along with the symptoms I have so many other problems. I can't walk or run because I have tarsal tunnel. I'm losing my memory. I used to be a really smart guy and I'm beginning to lose trace of common sense things like spelling short words and simple facts. I'm losing much of what I've gained from my education and It's terrifying. On top of this, I've lost my touch for writing essays. I have to write college app essays and my first is due on January 6th and all of my essays suck ass. I'm addicted to video games. Seriously addicted. There is a sick feeling I have when I'm away from the internet. This makes it hard to keep up with responsibilities like high school and chores. I don't know how I am going to go to college or get a job if I can't do those simple things successfully.

The worst problem of them all is that I have become completely and utterly terrible at socialization. I don't have one single friend. I'm even drifting away from my sister. My outer personality has changed so much if that makes any sense. It's like who I am on the outside doesn't represent who I am on the inside. On the outside I've become an obnoxious unlikeable fool while on the inside I'm still same old me. I used to be a likable person. I still want to have friends and I try hard to make them in school, but I can't. Nobody likes me. Nobody trusts me. I just want a friend its so lonely. By far this is the worst part of being depressed and having dpdr. I think I would be okay if I could just socialize successfully. Also I've become super scared of going out because it requires socializing which I suck at. I can never think of what to say and when I do say something I always fuck up. 

I just want to be normal again."

I have everything I could need to not be depressed. I have medication, I have an ESA, I have a supportive girlfriend. But none of it seems to truly help.

I was put down by my roommates, from being called dumb, making fun of my aspirations, and I felt like a reject and lame in some sorts. After leaving that roommate situation, I definitely feel better mentally, however I still have PTSD. I feel like I'm just boosting everyone's ego because I'm so down all the time and don't really challenge the thoughts of others, and I feel like everyone is doing better than me. A guy ""studying"" photography made a stupid video and basically said that I'm a loser. My grades have been really good, much better than high school, however a lot of the time, I feel like I'm a loser, someone who doesn't deserve what he has and I'm just privileged. It's messed up my self esteem and how I approach people, my daily routine has crumbled, and with the protests in March, it feels like I won't make it all the way through life as a black male.

 It’s been an absolute chore to engage with anyone or anything, which is odd for me, because usually at Christmas time it feels like a bit of an escape from the slog of everything else. But not so, finally, this time round. 

 Anyway, I recently saw a post on reddit that was about continuing to do things you know you used to enjoy (if you remember what that was like), NOT because it’s enjoyable in the moment. But because it builds the habit of doing things you enjoy so that when on the off chance you feel good, you’ve built up the “muscle memory” of engaging in hobbies. 
 
It struck a chord with me, because I feel like over the years I’ve become absolutely passive in the moments I’m happy. In those moments I don’t want to do anything because the stress of exerting myself, even if to turn on a video game console, would sink me back into stress and then depression. 
 
 This is why it’s important to carry on engaging in these hobbies even if it feels exhausting and agonising during particular flare ups for me. 
 So this Christmas, having taken that information to heart, I’ve been slowly challenging myself to engage in things I know I used to enjoy even if right now I am drained. I’ll do it steadily and take plenty of breaks, and know that even though right now it feels utterly pointless, it likely won’t feel that way in a month or so’s time when I’m feeling slightly more alive."

Lately, especially this year, I have kind of lost interest in everything. I sit in front of my desk for about 15 hrs everyday, because I have nothing else to do. But I can't even work efficiently anymore. I feel like my brain just works slower than it used to 3-4 years ago. I seem to make the silliest mistakes, no matter how hard I concentrate.

I used to be really into gaming, football and a few other things. So I tried giving them another go, but it felt just, so ordinary. I couldn't care less about them. I would stay up all weekend playing Assassin's Creed and GTA, but I couldn't even get through the first hour for the new one I just paid 60 bucks for.

The biggest blow for me was a few days ago, where I kind of got accused for not putting in enough effort, that maybe I was having too much fun at home. That just broke me. I knew that my boss was wrong. But I also understand that there is no point if I'm not giving them any results.

I know that there are a lot of people who had so much worse things happen to them, and that I have no right to be complaining about my boss being a fucking asshole (That's literally the definition of a boss). But I have just never felt this horrible. Each day is worse than the last and I can't get out of this loop. I just wanna lie down and not think about the next day.

I went to therapy, I have the sweetest boyfriend, I’ve fully devoted myself to healing and yet I still manage to feel this way sometimes. It’s gotten better, much better, but now that I’ve kinda gone back a step, one step back feels like a mile back. 
I want to be healthier, quit smoking, fuck I want to do some yoga right now but I can’t get up. It just feels like I’m not in control of my body anymore. I don’t want to burden my partner with my sadness, I don’t want to get triggered everytime I’m even reminded of my family. 
I’ve gone many miles away from my family and yet it feels like their words and actions echo in my head. Like I never left them at all. I hate them. I can’t get far enough from them, how dare they treat me like shit for 20 years and think that it’s ok. How dare they make me apologize to them for ‘causing stress on the family’ after I was honest and open about my depression. I sincerely cannot wrap my head around the fact that they have no desire to understand me and who I am. Why do I have to apologize to people who think that I am a (and these these next words are an exact quote) “druggy slut who has no future.” In fact my mother has even asked me why she even gave birth to me. 
I know I wasn’t the best student, but I was sad long before that. I wasn’t allowed to have any interests of my own, everytime I liked something or someone it was “don’t like that”. Essentially, my family and brother included used to gang up on me and bully me at home emotionally. Constantly making fun of me. I was never the star child. My big brother was, so he was always a ‘parental figure’ in the family. Or at least he saw himself that way the way he bossed me around. He even exploited me sexually which is one of the darker chapters in my life that took me a total of 6 years to even talk about. And all they cared about was my grades. And since my grades were bad, well they just abused me more and more and more until I shut myself off and left. 
My therapist told me that sometimes people won’t change, and that distance would help. She taught me how to cope and how to fight these thoughts. I wish I had someone to talk to about this.

My family didn’t really understand the American education system so everything seemed confusing to me as well. I didn’t feel like I had anyone to reach out to for help. I ended up dropping out of college when I was 19/20 and worked full time till I was 23. I always felt that I was the cautionary tale to people in the community. 

I went back to college at 23/24 and recently finished law school. I thought I would feel better about myself, I don’t. Despite working my ass off my entire way through law school working in environmental, personal injury and my main career field business law, as well as teaching as a TA, and being a student organization president no matter what I do I just always feel like a loser. 

It always comes back to well you did these things it was hard but you should have done it in your early to mid twenties. I always feel behind. I always feel like I’m not doing enough. I get flashbacks all the time of mistakes I regret. It really kills me. I feel drained. 

Now after law school I still have to wait for the BAR results. So now it feels like I’m still a loser but all I’ve accomplished is putting myself in a world of debt for the hope that maybe one day I can afford to live comfortably. I just hate myself and I hate these thoughts playing in my head. I’ve read suggestions on how to deal with depression and anxiety, doesn’t work for me. I always read on Reddit how things get better just keep moving but I doubt it. I just don’t know at my age just starting my career I don’t think I’ll ever get better. 

At this point I feel like I’m just staying here to keep other people happy. I’m just playing the role of the ambitious son who has all his shit together striving towards success. I’m 30 just finished school with a shit load of debt the rest of the people around me all have careers a lot have kids and here I am just starting. And now I feel like I am just whining.

Honestly I don't even feel like I have to justify this because I don't care for the stigma, DO and MD are equal to me, but yeah I wold take going to a DO school in a bigger city over the MD school in my much smaller (barely) a city.

I'm terrified it's not going to happen. I'm terrified that I'm about to turn 24 but 26 and 27 will be right around the corner and I still won't get in.

Since I live in Taiwan and my parents have been sending me to meaningless cram school to prepare for the entry exam for junior high school, I basically have all my time studying since I was like fking 10 years old. Now that I think about it, I have never had a close friend and let alone a girlfriend. And it all just because I spent all my time studying school bs and having completely no entertainment at all. 

And finally, after all my hard work studying fk 10 hrs a day for the entry exam, I got in the dream school (for my parents not for me). My classmates inside that school were all very mean. I was called 'piece of shit' every single day, and I dared not saying anything back, because I felt that would make them bully me even more. Also there were multiple classmates who would hit me or laugh at me whenever I did something they didn't agree with. 

And I suppose the main reason they bullied me was because of my fking miserable height 160cm (about 5'3) which is like the lowest 1% for Taiwanese male. I lacked confidence doing anything since then including talking to a girl. Before university, I have never hanged out with a girl even as a group.

After my miserable secondary school life, I was finally in university and got out of the control of my parents. And with massive luck and my own effort, I had several friends and a very close female friend(my girlfriend later on). All of a sudden, the fking Chinese virus showed up and ruined everything. I was forced to have a long distance relationship with her and things didn't work out. Therefore, I probably lose the only chance I will ever have such an intimate relationship with someone for a stupid pandemic.

Sum up the story, I have always had no friend since my parents forced me to study for something I am not interested in. Then in secondary school, I found out the fact that I have a pathetic height and I was bullied for whatever reason. Then after all that and my parents kept telling me I could have a happy life once I got into a great uni, and in reality I don't due to the fking virus ruining everything.

And now, I am extremely introverted, lack of confidence, lonely af and don't have any hope for my future.

I had behavior therapy for my relationshipOCD. There was always a slight depression going with it, but my therapist and I clearly set the focus to the way worse OCD.

Now that therapy has ended a few months ago and I lost my job, my mental health got worse. OCD came back a little bit, anxiety too. But I feel like the depression got worse. 

I would really like to start another (behavior) therapy. But in my last therapy, we mostly talked about how my week ended, my intrusive thought etc.
I feel like you would handle the depression the same - but as I had a therapy like that already and nothing much in my life has changed, how would it help me anyway? It would just be the same or not?

And how does therapy for depression work in general?

TLDR: How does therapy for depression work? Especially when you had therapy (for OCD) already?"

I don't want to bore you all with an essay so I'll cut to the chase. Covid has completely fucked me up mentally. I live in the UK, so this year has mostly been under restrictions which for the most part has forbidden me to meet with others in public spaces and generally enjoy life as normal. Initially I was fine, however as months have passed I have completely lost all motivation in life, as every day is the same bleak day of boredom and isolation from the outside world, leading to me developing an addiction to social media to give me happiness, yet it has only made matters worse. As a result of this lack of motivation I have developed this constant feeling of sadness and low confidence, and my mind constantly is putting me down, I.e. I keep judging and over-thinking everything I'm doing with my life and, whilst one would generally think that would motivate me to change, it has somehow made me feel shit about myself and discouraging me from finding the strength to improve things. I acknowledge I'm not the only one, but 2020 has been especially crap for me. I've struggled with the loss of my grandfather to cancer, and on top of that my parents are probably going to get divorced. I can't continue with things like this anymore. I have poor eating habits, struggle to sleep properly, and can no longer focus at school as I used to. Believe me, I've searched everywhere for solutions all over the internet, as well as confiding in those close to me, but whilst they work in the short term, they provide very little help to my situation, as it continues to worsen. To sum up, I just can't ""hang in there"" until it's over. It needs to stop now, before I might just end it all."

Basically, since he left his job due to covid back in feb-mar he has been doing this thing where he argues with himself. Its usually like 3 to 4 different arguments from work that he is replaying in his head and he responds to them now with what he would like to say because he never got a chance to say it in the moment. It has gotten to the point where it is controlling him from the moment he wakes up, to the time he goes to sleep. Im posting this here because I guess he does show some signs of depression, doesn't clean up after himself, no motivation, all he ever really does is stay home and smoke cigarettes (up to 2 packs a day now) while this thing keeps replaying on and on in his mind. The only way he eats is when he orders take out, so between that, the cigarettes and no job, he's almost at the point of being dead broke. My entire family is worried because we don't know what to do. And if anyone tries to talk to him about it he automatically shuts it down. I am trying my best to help him get things under control but it seems like nothing works. He has also put on an unhealthy amount of weight do the lifestyle. And the arguments can sometimes get loud. He is currently rooming with my cousin and I will be staying with them for new years, am here now, and my cousin has told me that on few occasions he comes home and my brother will be in the back screaming his arguments out loud. They live in an apartment that has plenty of other people around. I'm worried one day someone will call the cops or that he might do something. I honestly don't know what I expect from this post but I have to keep trying.

Edit: just a few more things I have noticed. He tends to be completely spaced out like the other day we were at the grocery store and he walked directly into me, bumping my shoulder and didn't even notice. While we're watching tv he will watch but not acknowledge what's actually going on. Its the same when someone talks to him, he seems like he's listening but never gives a response. It hurts so fucking much seeing him like this. My cousin deals with it the most since they live together and he's honestly kinda giving up on him because its exhausting."

The generations of people that could of been born could of became scientists that discover new things that help humanity, doctors that save humanity, the next great activist (ie; good people like Martin Luther king) or just valuable assets of a community.

I'm not sure if this comes off as fucked up or not, but these days to get out of a funk I remind myself someone has it worse. For ex) I could be in a concentration camp with the Uighurs force fed pork and murdered with the world not batting an eye, I could be a El Salvadorian refugee locked up in a cage and getting raped by ICE, I could have cancer, I could be homeless, I could not have function in my legs, I could be blind, etc.

I remind myself how lucky and blessed I am just to simply be able to breathe. Not sure if I came off preachy- I apologize if I offended anyone, I just wanted to share my thoughts.

For those who may have been in a similar position I'm interested in hearing your opinions and any advice from the other side of this.

Ex boyfriend broke up with me a couple of months ago, when he did he disclosed he was struggling with depression and anxiety as the reason for break up and he needed to be alone to see himself through (it's since become apparent he was dealing with feelings of worthlessness and that he thought he was dragging me down). It ended with him saying that if we had met next year after Covid this would have been entirely different and me, mistakenly out of hurt, saying that I don't see how that would work as one of us would eventually have to move on (clearly in my mind meaning he would as I would struggle to move on, but afterwards realising he probably thought I meant me even though he didn't want me to wait for him). I asked to be friends so I could at least be part of his support system and he agreed but needed time apart so I said I'd contact him over Christmas which he agreed to and that in the meantime I was here if he needed anything.

Almost two months go by, I worked a lot on myself and trying to understand his situation and mental health so I could be there for him. I contacted him Christmas day and he replied immediately saying he was going to reach out as well. After that managed to exchange a couple more texts but I made sure to keep it light and not talk about anything triggering even though deep down all I wanted was to ask if he was ok and if he was finally getting counselling. He then didn't reply and left me on read for 2 days, reached out and I am now another two days waiting for a reply with no guarantee he will reply again really.

At the moment I understand that his depression and anxiety are probably getting in the way of him replying - that maybe he needs to create space and not reply everyday so he doesn't have to be reminded of the hurt of the breakup or be sucked back into a relationship or even that he senses I may still want to pursue things and doesn't want to lead me on; the possible explanations are endless. But I'm also facing thoughts of ""I'm very low priority for him and he's online on whatsapp actively ignoring my messages and flirting with other people on hookup apps"" without really knowing where he stands.

I guess my question is, if this stays this way by either him not replying or keeping the pattern of taking days to reply every time is there a point I should reach out and attempt to have an honest conversation as to what's going on in his head? Or can I really only work through that after I hopefully reestablish trust one day? I know it's a long road ahead and it can only really happen if he's willing.

  
TL;DR To those who broke up with someone/pushed them away due to depression and then had the other person attempt to re-establish contact after a bit as a friend with boundaries so it's not as much pressure only to be met with you actively ignoring them, what was going on in your head and how did you wish the other person approached you? 

If a close friend is having an episode and doesn't reply I usually don't think much of it but that they need space even when they are also actively on whatsapp, so I send them something simple every day or other day so they know I'm there but I don't think it's appropriate to do that in this case."

Ive been depressed since 12, and have had suicidal thoughts since 9. When i was 12, i asked 5 girls out over the course of a year. Got rejected every time. People made fun of me for it. I quickly learned and promised myself never to ask anyone out ever again. I also had a best ""friend"" who used to be really funny and cool. But all of a sudden, he started hitting me, spilling my secrets to other people, talking shit abt me behind my back, and calling me a faggot (im bisexual). It destroyed me and i have had serious trust issues since. When i was 13, a girl offered me a blowjob. I refused. A few months later, the same girl sent me nudes and started begging me to send a dick pic. My stupid ass agreed and sent it. She sent it to so many people. Half the school then started making fun of me and calling me a pervert. I never exposed her or told my side of the story because i am too weak. Crazy rumors started spreading, some going as far as me raping her. Many people believe them. I was now known as a freak and a pervert. I started hating going outside because im terrified of running into someone i know and them thinking im a pervert. Then there was a group chat. A few of my friends and some people i knew were in it. I have a friend who is pretty dark and tells me to kill myself sometimes as a joke. I dont care and dont take it seriously because its a joke. I said it to him in the group chat once and everyone told me im an asshole and fucked up. They then kicked me out. I now feel i have no friends. I transferred high schools to get away from people i know. Why am i so fucking stupid? Its all my fault because i was too naiive and lacked common sense. I started drinking and smoking to ease the pain. Every day i think about what ive done and how much i hate myself. My parents dont know anything because if i told them or they found out, it would break them. They think im happy and talented. I hate myself. I want to die."

I know I sound whiny and ungrateful. I've got this whole life ahead of me that I'm supposed to enjoy and look forward to, but I'm dreading everything.

Nothing makes me happy. I worked and worked and worked and made enough money to buy my dream bass guitar and built my dream PC to play video games on, but now that I have them, I'm not even interested in using them. I wanna work out and look good, I wanna take care of myself, but everything feels like a hassle.

When I don't have the things I want in life, I'm unhappy, but at least I have something to dream about and work towards. When I have them, I just wind up unhappier than I was. I took a gap year to explore adult life a bit and live a little, but I hate it. It's directionless and meandering. I put up an ad to get back into a band, but nobody has contacted me. My PC has heat issues I can't be bothered to fix. Anything I do, I can think of many reasons not to do it... I think Russian literature calls it 'chandra.'

Anything nice in life, there's always a BUT. I'm beginning to question why I live. I keep thinking, get through school, make a lot of money. A little more money will make you happy. But it doesn't. I just feel empty all the time.

The only thing I enjoy is eating. And even then, I've lost my appetite. Losing weight just by being, 'cause I can't be bothered to get myself food. Even women, bars, going out and all that stuff doesn't interest me anymore, not even drinking or socializing. Being with people hurts me, being alone does as well. Nothing is fun for more than a fleeting moment. Then it's back to dreariness."

Where’s the boy that would randomly, yet frequently, check up on his peers? Where’s the boy that was motivated to graduate top of his year? Where’s the boy who actually cared?

I have no clue what happened. I’m in my last 10 months of high school, and I just can’t wait for it to fly by. I left a really good school, good friends, good lifestyle, good mindset, good city, when I moved here exactly a year ago. This year’s probably been the worst of my life. Not because of COVID. But because I hate it here. I live so far from my school, which has definitely impeded my ability to get close to those at my school. But it’s not like I really want to. I dislike everyone there. Some are more tolerable than others, but I’d rather be on my own. 

I have absolutely no motivation. Or at least it’s very short lived. I should be studying my ass off these holidays. I’ve wasted 14 days already, and only have 30 left. I keep telling myself to not do something I’ll regret. Well, does doing nothing count as doing something?

I don’t know what’s happened to me. I burnt the fuck out a month ago, and I took like a 2 week break, but I guess it wasn’t enough. And I’m not even trying to be better. I’m so ready to give up. I’m shutting down. And I’m letting myself do it. No fight. Which is super unlike me. I’m in survival mode now I guess. 

I feel nothing. I’ve tried to cry, but things that used to make me cry just don’t anymore. Things that should concern me, don’t. I feel so numb. 

I don’t feel like I care about anything anymore. I still kinda care about my grades. Guess that’s hard wired, but I’ve been talking to friends less, and I can’t really imagine a life out of high school. Just seems like there’s no point to anything I do. 

I’m so lazy right now. I’m somewhat suicidal, and I’ve self harmed in the past, but I just have not been able to get up and do it again. Guess that’s a good thing."

I dont really know if I'm looking for advice or not, I really just wanted to write this down somewhere so it's not weighing so hard on my shoulders.

In job interviews they always ask you ""What's one weakness you've overcome?"" Or something similar. Every time, I always think how I've struggled with anger my entire life, and how with childhood therapy I was able to get control of it. But I'm not completely sure if I really did.
It feels like everyone around me has their anger on a switch that they can just turn off as easily as it comes on. Not me though. People count to 10 to calm themselves, but when I count to 50 I still feel the rage burning me. Everyone operates on a switch, while mine is on a dimmer. It may be low, but it's always on.

I just found out a while ago my now ex had been cheating on me. There was only one thing I cared about, and it completely betrayed me.
I havent been into work for a week, I've probably been fired.
I scheduled an appointment with a new therapist and he forgot about me, so now I have to reschedule for another time.
And each day it gets harder to not be angry. My life is going nowhere, I always just want to cry and punch something. I keep struggling to find even one reason why I'm alive. I want nothing more than to die and have it look like an accident. I've began praying for it, regardless of the fact that I'm atheist."

I have been feeling depressed for nearly 4 months or so.... I have been triggered in many ways in all these years... I have witnessed three deaths in 10 years time (2005-2014) one of them was my father's... I was 13 at the time ....n all the deaths were in family.... had to move back n forth thrice ... I also am an introvert person n hardly have any friends... The few stabbed me n twisted the knife so hard that I almost lost myself at the time... deceived me with new people... I had been in a relationship too but it was kinda rough n it ended badly traumatizing me... I had given up soo much for this relationship..( my family didnt n still doesn't know about it... reasons I ll tell later)... 

I was good at academics n still am not soo bad but have lost a lots of spark which I had in me..I had just completed my graduation on am currently doing my post .... N Ngl.. these three years of graduation literally were the harshest in my life..... I lost friends Love and my self confidence altogether.... N I started getting more n more traumatized... Here is this thing.. The country I come from has no real awareness regarding mental health and depression.. It's either you are all good or mentally retarded... I cant even talk about this to my family since It is this stereotype where I live... Depression means You are mentally n emotionally weak ... besides It's not my AGE to fall into depression... 

I also haven't moved out n stay in joint family ... I also feel disconnected with my family ... to everyone I have always been a person who u call REBEL ( not in a bad way).. I am not supposed to be in relationships.. its scandalous here..I mean it... Not my family in general is reason but society tbh... 

I feel low n cant focus.. I feel tired n inactive which my family thinks as rebellion which actually is not...I cant talk to them openly mainly becoz I dont think I can confide in them with my issues for I know they ll consider these as my tantrums n that shit hurts fr.. I had tried to talk to them before but in vain.. I am often told off n considered as the most childish in family... I accept that I have made some stupid mistakes ..  n I have been hit hard by them( they were not scandalous.. but really stupid).. just few days back I had got myself in a serious problem n still trying to work through it... I know I am not perfect n yess... I stay aloof all the time which looks sketchy but I can't help... I feel disconnected... discouraged n completely drained out of energy and emotions... I dont feel beautiful or confident n am hopeless like fuck about my future... my love life... my career... I cry almost everyday.. every night n feel worthless like hell....N I know my family my friends my people won't understand me....

Therapy is no option here... I gotta give thousand explanations of no use.. And in my area .. there is not good therapy clinics or something... n moving in pandemic is out of question....

Sooo... I am reaching to u all people for the help.. advices... I really need them... what I have written is not even the half how I am feeling right now.. m with what shits I am coping up with ... I am at my lowest n want to be redeemed.... 

Plsss be generous n guide me... I am really miserable rn and trying every thing to hold on myself... But I dont think that I ll be able to for long.... 

Sorry for any writing mistake.. english ain't my first language and if u find this post gaga... its bcoz i am typing this post while I feel dead sleepy.. I cant really focus..

Thanx for reading... n advices are really appreciated.."

So I got broken up with and as a result that's taken away nearly all of my socialising. When it first happened (about a week ago) I was messaging people because I knew that I would end up alone so I wanted to put those feelers out to people and be like, hello I've been broken up with and really just need some general chats here and there. And of course that's not happened and I don't want to go crawling back to people like, hello me again, fancy a chat because I just feel so desperate and lonely. This is why I got broken up with I think, because he was my socialising and  I was just too dependant on him. But I'm trying to have others but it doesn't seem to work. I guess I should just try and be comfortable with myself, but it's quiet and lonely here and I'm bored and don't really want to be alone with myself. 

I miss just chilling in the discord group with his friends. I was only really in the background and tbh I don't think the people there actually knew I was there (I wasn't actually connected to the channel, just hearing via his account) so I can't really just go there again, plus it's his family / friends and I don't want to put myself where he's going to be. 

I feel tempted to make one with a group of friends I have but it just feels really superficial, like I don't actually want to do that, I just feel like I have to or else I'll have nothing. 

I feel really desperate, and also anxious about sending the first message, but also don't want to be desperate so any advice would be nice."

So I have been in a relationship since one year. I am genuinely happy with my partner, he understands me so well, i can't thank him enough for it because he really helps me a lot with my anxiety, but sometimes there's this thing I can't gather words to explain how I really feel, i push everyone away. Even when I know he understands me so well, and he always says if I need him I can call or text him whenever I want to, so I can feel a bit better, But I guess i push him away, he tries his best to help me out, and I do feel better, but sometimes can't explain things to him even. because i can't figure it out myself.

I would say he helped me heal a lot, and I know he really cares, but sometimes I feel like i don't need anyone even when I know he can help me out I don't reach for help. I don't know if it makes any sense. I really don't have any negative thoughts about my relationship, i am really happy, but my anxiety really kills a lot. idk how to help myself get out of this. I don't know how to even start a conversation once I am back, because my mind is so blank. He have been really busy now a days he still manages to take out time and talk to me, but idk i am anxious about me upsetting him about not telling him things, though he sounds all good but i feel anxious, even if he takes sometime to text back i feel he is annoyed though he isn't even. idk how to help."

I lost my dad when I was 14, which kind of set the tone for my life and as I got older I just more and more lonely because of it. My mother and siblings Im not close to for a number of different reasons which I won't go into. Ive always tried to distance myself from my mom because she's so toxic and then my siblings all have substance abuse issue of varying degrees. My dad was the only one I related to and had anything in common with.

4 Years ago I fractured my skull which gave my symptoms of a mild traumatic brain injury. I recovered from it a good amount and tried to go back to a normal life. 10 months later I could suffer a concussion and not be the same for 4 years up until this past summer when I started making strides in my recovery. And then in October I bumped my head on a bird feeder and now I sensitive to sound and light again, overstimulated, and exhausted all the time. I told myself those 4 years better days are coming and you'll get better someday and you can start your own family with someone who cares about you. Well nope..not gonna happen now and Ill never get back to a more normal life and just like now nobody will ever love me. I have decided that I think the best thing to do is to take my own life. The only reason I haven't yet is because I dont wan to hurt my niece and nephew. Thats not enough to keep me going because I know im going to just continue to spiral down from this feeling of defeat. Im just so lonely and I dont want to spend my life alone, on a computer, trying to get the things I need socially from strangers. I just think its time for me to give into this life thats been trying to defeat me as best it could. 

Edit: please don’t comment about my concussion if you are not either a doctor, fellow suffer, or don’t have something encouraging to say. People with mTBI and fully recover or have a “normal life”. Brain injury is on a very large spectrum"

Meanwhile, famous people that are depressed, or just claim to be depressed for attention and sympathy(those people exist), get attention from thousands of people. If that's the case, why don't they bring more awareness to depression in general. That way more people can get the help they need. 

When famous people talk about depression, the reaction of everyone is: ""poor you, you went through allot"".

When I talk about my depression, the reaction of everyone is:""just man up, bruh"". Either that, or they start talking about themselves and their problems(which I listen to and I try to help them). But it feels like my problems are almost always ignored, or used as a conversation segway, ""speaking of problems, lets talk about my problems"".

So does anyone feel that society doesn't care about you unless you're a celebrity?"

If I can touch another soul or souls, show that there is hope in this messed up world. And a person is feeling the same way. 

It has been years where I got the strength on telling my stories of Epilepsy, death, and just all the issues I have kept from people I love and love me. I never thought my stories, writings, and poem was worth hearing. 

I try telling my friends and family my hard ships but all they say maybe you talk to a therapist, yes that is true, but I have many times and it does not help. Yes, did help me with getting over a horrible monster called an ex. Since the only way I can tell how I really is not speaking through my mouth but through writing ink to paper. Now it is the typing words to help other too. Also, it helped me.  

My point is that tell the world your stories in anyway you want. Because you are worth it. I believe you can get through any tough time you are going through. 

Also, I want is to show someone that they are not alone, and always kept things to yourself, which is not good either because you can have a break down like I have many times. 

If it was not for you guys, I would not be sharing these poems and write about my stories.

My friend (18F) and I (18M) had crushes on each other since the day we met. We didn’t say anything the last few years, only until fairly recently. We were in a tightly knit group of friends, and that’s probably a reason why we didn’t say anything out of fear of jeopardizing our friendship and group. She was the best friend I’ve ever had, we had some amazing adventures, she always gave the best gifts and knew how to effortlessly lift me up when I was down. She was really with me thick and thin, and I tried my best to be there for her too. I always supported her, from when she had stuff going on at home, to when she wanted a sex change, I always just wanted her to do what she wants, be who she wants. During Covid my family locked down really hard, and she was the only one of my friends who would visit me and we would spend time. This would develop into something a bit more when she told me how she felt a month before she had to leave for college, and we found a way to get intimate a few times before she left. I planned on never telling her how I felt as I knew it would complicate things, but too late for that now. I tried my best not to, but already having crushed on her the entire few years I’ve known her, I fell in love. I know it sounds stupid and it is, I fucking hate it but I love that goddamn fool. During our time together when we were closest, she would tell me things and show her affection for me which made me feel really good, and made me feel like I was doing things right. Then she had to leave for college, and we kept talking for a bit but soon she became unresponsive not only to me, but the rest of our friends as well. During this time my heart broke, I became the most depressed I ever have in my life. And social media is a curse, because even today I see her having a good time, and hanging out with our friends and such and I still feel so fucking shitty. She met me for 30 minutes when she first came back into town, and although it was great to see her it was awkward at first which was expected but we got a bit into the tough talk about our lack of communication. We were cut of by a security guard of the lot we met up at, so our meeting was pretty abrupt. We’ve only talked one other time which was a week or so later we FaceTimed for a few, and she talked a lot about her time at college. She didn’t ask much about me, which I guess is fine as I don’t have a whole lot going on in my life other than playing guitar, distancing, distanced hanging with friends when I can and trying to get a job. But I tried hitting her up again a while later about talking again soon, to no response. I’ve always known that she would do great things, and I’ve wanted nothing more for her than everything she deserves. Being at college gives her a freedom I know she’s been dying for the last few years, so I know how much it means to her. Only issue is, I still fucking love her and to this day still can’t get her out of my head. I’ve come to the conclusion that I knew she cared for me, but I loved her and those are two different things. When we were closest she’d tell me things, fill in blanks from our past that really made me think that we cared each other about the same way, but it’s obviously not the case anymore. She never hits me up it’s always me, but I see her hanging out with our friends. It’s really disheartening to know that the person you care most about doesn’t want much to do with you. At this rate I don’t think I’ll see her again before she leaves, and that’s that. I feel immensely shitty about it all because I feel like I’ve done everything I can to show that I care, and want to figure things out so we can function again but I don’t think that’s on her agenda at all. She’s moved on, and I hate that I haven’t. At this point I’m not hitting her up anymore, because if she wanted to talk to me she would and where I’m at emotionally and mentally I don’t know if I can do this anymore. It’s truly killing me that after all we’ve been through, this is how it’s going to end. And I acknowledge that maybe this isn’t the end, but even if she did show interest again I think I’m too fucked up over all this do get to that place of vulnerability again. Before I was indifferent about getting close to others and to have sex, but while we were closest I began to get more comfortable around it and got curious about getting intimate and sexy with others, and now the idea is just repelling. This whole ordeal combined with other things in my life that m struggling with, I just feel beaten, battered, and used. It sucks that the person I love most in this world doesn’t want me anymore and that the possibility of us being able to continue any aspect of our friendship feels like it’s shrinks smaller and smaller every day. I’ve done everything I can, but it isn’t enough. Any words or wisdom, advice, or personal experiences would be appreciated. Thank you so much for your time Reddit, don’t know what I would do without you. 

TL:DR
A close friend of mine and I got super intimate before she left for college, but after she left we stopped taking. She’s back now and although things seem weird, I’ve done everything I can to show that I still care and want to figure out how we can still be friends or make things work. This is useless, as she isn’t returning the effort she once showed with a fiery passion. How tf do I get over the dream girl I once had? How to you adjust to the bottom of the hill after you reached the mountaintop?"

I’ve always been quite a curious & flexible person with a lot of interests and hobbies. Besides that, my field of work requires me to be flexible and to constantly stay up to date, try out new tools, learn new features and so on.

However, lately, I feel like having to learn something new is making me anxious and feels off-putting. While I used to enjoy learning, now it’s something that feels like a chore.

I have no clue how it became this way. It’s not even exclusively work related. For example, I’m learning how to play World of Warcraft and it’s totally overwhelming me. I’m not enjoying it. Another example, I’m moving to Evernote for my ‘second brain’ system and also here having to structure the account is stressing me out. While it shouldn’t feel like such a big deal. Because it isn’t.

Basically, I stopped enjoying the process of learning. It feels like my curiosity has died and I don’t want to commit time anymore.

It could also be just too much at once, I started a new job in September and am really still learning the ropes. It’s also a start-up so a very hectic and chaotic place.

Has anyone gone through something similar? I miss my old self.

I do feel like my information diet is a problem. I read too much and I want to do too much so in the end I end up doing nothing. Besides that, I do have very high expectations of myself.

The problems started when I had a severe depression last year. I am still taking Wellbutrin, but mentally I feel a lot better. Besides that I’m autistic and despite having developed good social skills and a great career, the burden’s of needing structure and routines will never go away.

I realize this is turning into a big posts with a lot of questions, but writing it down felt good and if someone has any tips to offer I would be glad to read them.

Take care & happy NY!"

It'll be the most fun I have with my imagination at this point. It seems everything that has to do with me is over complicated. "

I broke up with my ex in October 2019. We continued talking in the next few months and were working things out when she ghosted me in the spring. I then hooked up with my ex from before her a few times later this summer and fall. That also harshly and abruptly ended. 
They are 2 of the only 3 women I've ever slept with. I have been trying to move on and date for basically the first time in my life, and i have no idea what I'm doing. It seems i hardly even get matches on dating apps and I'm not very good at making interesting conversation when i do. I'm basically so nervous about my inexperience dating that it takes me seemingly forever to write a simple message or reply.This has been going on most of this year. 
I don't even have friends to meet people through anymore, as they all mostly got married or moved when i was in those relationships.
 I'm not necessarily looking for the love of my life right now, but the bleakness of my experience this year makes me feel like I'm entirely undesirable. I wish i could find relief from these feelings"

Sorry zac.,6,2,1609229167.0,"I have something called limerence, sort of an obsession with someone who you feel like you're in love with and I haven't talked to him in nearly 2 years ( I'm also a boy ) our history is complicated, he'd always roast me and say such cruel things to my face like anyone at his school did before I left but I've been bullied like that my whole life since like year 3 but idk why I just kept having feelings for him and they never got away. I asked to talk to him at first and he said I'm being weird cause I kept saying I'm sorry and after s few hours I said I needed too so he let me and like the next day he read it and it was a lot, he apologized for the stuff he said but his message wasn't even that long and I felt like he didn't really truly like soak up all I said as mine was like my life story. I sorta told him I liked him in another message and said why and he said we're good but I was so confused. I didn't get the answer I wanted but didn't get the answer I didn't want either, like yes we're good but are we going to be friends again? If so how when I have all these feelings, emotions, everything for him. It's ironic how he's still the only reason I'm alive even tho he was a big part of the reason why I wanted to commit suicide a few years back. I talked to him on the 27/12/20 and it was the first time I've talked to anyone outside of my 3 fam members + therapist since March 19th ( covid  here in aus isn't as and as the rest so school started in April) but my anxiety and everything was too much so I stopped going, I'm on antidepressants now, have been for months and they don't seem to do anything, I don't feel better, I had the packet in my hand last night temped. I cry myself to sleep nearly every night. I have no friends. I can't be happy even on my own. I don't think zac ever realized how much he impacted me and idk what to do I really wanna die but I'm so stupidly scared of what comes after like is it just eternal nothingness or what but I'm still here cause of him because I guess I didn't get the answer I wanted? I said something else to him and he left me on seen...  Idk how to feel, I'm confused, tired of life. School is so much for me like what's the point my anxiety makes me fail exams and I won't get into uni, I don't wanna work even tho I'm nearly 18 as it's just too much effort which I don't have.. what's the point?"

I used to read, play video games, hang out with friends, etc; now I just feel like sitting in my dark room with my phone to my face. 

I suppose the title of this post refers to my sudden fascination with death. I enjoy watching documentaries about serial killers, crime shows, and anything relating to death. I can admit I’ve had suicidal thoughts before, although I have been strong enough to never follow through. 

I am swimming in sea of turbulent waters, yet everybody around me has some sort of vessel for support. 

I am depressed."
kma08y,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kma08y/is_there_something_wrong_with_me_am_i_thinking/,Is there something wrong with me? Am I thinking too much?,2,0,1609228408.0,"Hello. I’m going to preface this by saying I have not been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and have not been to a doctor’s in about a year, and not since these emotions started. I’m not sure if this adds anything, but I’m an 18 year old woman living at home.

I’m just feeling so lost these days. Whenever I get into this mindset, I find myself blaming it on staying up too late, or being tired, or not being able to go outside because of the lockdown. I feel so useless and replaceable. I’m too dependent on other people, but when I try to be independent, I get so lonely I start crying again.

I often compare my situation to how I was even a year ago, with a few best friends, my family fully intact, and nothing in particular being wrong. I’ve now lost touch with two best friends, which didn’t really hit me until I felt the lack of contact. The second one hurt, because it turned into a relationship I’m fairly certain I only got involved with so I wouldn’t hurt them, and then the break up was messy. I broke it off, but it was way too messy. My second oldest brother and I used to be best friends, but I kind of feel abandoned by him. He left my family and I in our worst moments. Over this past year, I realized how much of a liar and a cheat he was over multiple situations, some even tiny, where he’d lie to my face for no particular reason, and when I’d get upset, he’d make it seem like it was my fault, and I’m a bad person for not forgiving him. He stopped coming home these past few years, and then moved out at the beginning of this year. My mother began dating someone just a few months after my dad died (when I was 12), and put him before her own kids for years up until just recently, when she decided she stopped liking him. She used to tell me secrets about the men at her work liking her just before my dad passed, and how she didn’t love him but stayed anyways, and she’s back to doing it again because now she’s found another man she likes. I try to maintain a good relationship with my family, but I can’t bring myself to love my second brother like I used to, and I feel like I’m nothing to my mother sometimes, as now that my second brother’s baby is due soon, I can’t have any one-to-one conversation with her without her being upset that I’m not excited for his baby. I tell her it’s just that I don’t like children, but this isn’t entirely true—I just can’t find myself being excited for my brother because of the stuff he’s done to me and continues to do, and his girlfriend and I don’t really get along. It feels very much like a stranger’s baby to me. All of this to say, I’ve lost a good amount of trust in 2 of my 3 family members.

I think the only family I hold so close to me is my oldest brother, who still lives at home. I’m so caught up in trying to maintain a good relationship with him, I think I’m becoming too clingy and dependent, and he won’t want to be around me. And I know the day he moves out or falls in love, I’ll be completely alone. But he’s an adult and I should expect that to happen. I don’t know why I’m like this.

I think a lot of my fear is coming from the second brother and his baby, if I’m being honest. Maybe I’m overthinking this, but I think when my dad died, I began seeing my brothers as the only lasting piece of him. The second, especially, acts a lot like my dad did. So when he left and started to lie and distance himself from us, it felt like I was losing my dad again. I know I shouldn’t see him or my oldest brother like that. They are not my father. But I can’t shake this stupid, unnecessary pain. Or maybe there’s another reason for my hurting. 

The truth is, I’ve been having these thoughts almost daily, if not daily, particularly at night. It’s not that I’m never happy, it’s just that these thoughts creep up on me, even when I’m having a good time with my mom and brother. I can’t continue to be like this, I wasn’t like this before. I’ve told my mom that I think I might have a problem with my anxiety or something (none of the details), and she said she could try and get a doctor’s appointment in. I’m scared.

I’m sorry for this longwinded rant. I hope this isn’t too much. I hope the rest of you are having a good morning/night/afternoon."

I'm screwed anyway no other way around it. Sooooooooo........ I'm about to be homeless and I'm not seeing any solution to get me out of this situation. Sigh Alright here we go my pride is shattered anyway. I've been part of a program that helps people from becoming homeless. I believe they call it the ""pilot program""? Or something like that....Anyway I found a place to keep me from having to survive on the streets.....Well until today that is. I've been living here for about.....6 to 7 months. Irrelevant but still thought I should mention it anyway. Anyway I've just been informed that I have to move out before the 5th. See....my landlord is a bitch and we never see eye to eye. Even though she accepted me with open arms at the start of this whole thing because of our agreement. I clean and make sure things are in order around the house and only pay $450 instead of the full $700. Sounds like a dream right? Do some housework and you basically get a huge reduction off rent. Well, going back to when I said me and her don't see eye to eye, I my best to make sure things are done and in order, however she sees errors in my work. So I continually try to do things the way she ask me to do them but in her eyes something isn't done. Always, this has been a consistent issue ever since I've lived here and I've constantly tried to make things right but to no avail my efforts mattered little in the end. The program I'm a part of will only pay up to $500 also don't get me wrong, I've been looking for work but work is scarce where I live and trying to get a place to live is......well let's just say I live in California. Looking for a place to live that isn't overly priced and trying to find a job here at least where I live is something that happens very rarely. Also, Covid doesn't help, making many businesses shut down in my area. Well, there you have it.  I have major depressive disorder as well and I've been doing good however, I can feel an episode coming and I don't know but this may be my last. Anyway I wanted to at least tell somebody before everything goes to shit."

So I eventually got the best of college, met my college sweetheart there, then went on to get a very good job. 
4 years after graduating, here I am alone - alone and depressed. My long term college relationship turned out to be abusive and I stayed in it for almost 7 years. This year in March I decided that I couldn’t do it any more and I broke up. 
I have a high paying job which I also like at times. I am good at what I do. 

But nothing makes sense anymore. Every day, I am crying for no reason at all and it takes up so much energy to do my every day job. I can’t quit coz Inhave 2 loans and I can’t tell my family about this state of mine. It’s just not an option. As a result, there are times when I am crying even when everyone is around but I am so good at hiding that no body even gets to know what’s going on with me. 

Life just doesn’t makes sense. I know a lot of people are suffering much more than I am, people don’t have jobs, food, security. But if I can, I would trade places with them and give it all in the blink of an eye. The crying never stops, I am so tired. I keep thinking of ending it all together but I just don’t know how. It’s all the more difficult go on this along with all the work that I do on an everyday basis. But this feeling of emptiness and void has made me so vulnerable and it just never seems to get any better. 

Has anyone gone through this phase? If yes, how did you get better? I really want to end this life, if only anyone can help me get through with this"

Look i almost never post so im sorry if im doing this wrong.
Let me explain what lead to this decision and why it was so damn painfull for my last night.

When i was younger i met this girl, we where very close together but she moved away and we decided to have a long distance relationship. I had really short hair back then, We where together for almost 6 years untill depression really got an hold on me. I started using drugs and went on a dark road becease i was so lonely and depressed.
I broke up with her becease i know i will only hurt her if ahe found out ive been doing drugs.

Then i became addicted.
I got in maybe fights with my family and friends, and lost most people.

I searched for professional help and got it. ive been sober for three months and started getting anti depressants from my docter.
Last thursday my mother came to my room and told me my ex wants to talk to me, i was scared and nervous. Becease i never forgave myself for leaving her and been living with regrets ever since.

We had contact and it started casually, everything was oke untill she gave me the impression she wants me back. She has a boyfriend now and that idea hurts me so much. I told her i never got over her and she told me the same thing. But she also loves her new boyfriend.

I hate myself for leaving her, and i hate it even more knowing she still cares for me.

Ive been confused and in an emotional rollercoaster ever since. I love her and i want nothing more then her back. But that is impossible becease i fucked up.
Ive been growing my hair ever since we broke up and this morning i took alot of meds (more then i have been subscribed to), And i shaved my head."

As much and as hard as I try, I never am enough for people. Two of my best friends distanced far away from me and it hurts to see it, I'm doing mediocre in school, I dont fit in my friend group, my parents constantly give me shit for not doing enough and for a source of happiness I obtained a phone addiction. It annoys the fuck out of me because I'm scared of taking anti depressants because I don't want to be hooked/dependant (my mother already is on them) and therapy isn't too viable considering the pandemic. I have been cutting myself throughout last week as a means to cope tho I've stopped for a few days but it's been really tough. I feel empty as shit and the only reason I'm alive is that I don't want to scar my 8 year old brother who I love a lot but I dont even think he thinks much of me anymore. I don't want to be like this, I want to feel something. I want to feel that there's a point to what I do but no, there's no point. There never was, fuck I hate this. Makes me want to die yet I fear post death so here I am, in purgatory"
