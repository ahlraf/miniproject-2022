There‚Äôs no mental repercussions (at least not until later in the day when I want to eat again), I can control it and it doesn‚Äôt lead to a binge, I feel satisfied with the fact that I did eat.

Let me make myself clearer.

I have no clue how, back then, I used to eat everyday like it's its own day. As if what I eat today won't matter tomorrow and what I eat tomorrow won't matter the day after etc...

Lately, all I've been feeling is that the food I eat throughout the week still counts up to this very moment. For example, I ate an apple yesterday so it automatically counts both, yesterday and today and now I have to make up for it. (This is just an example, apples shouldn't be feared y'all).

I know everyday should be its own eating day but at the same time, I feel like everything counts and that I should constantly be compensating. This just gets ridiculous day by day ugh."

Well in the beginning it started by it self, like I wasn‚Äôt thinking completely about losing weight but, for every year that feeling of losing weight is getting stronger and stronger, like I really have been starting to think that everybody around me cares if I am skinny- that It looks more ‚Äúsexy‚Äù (like instead of thinking of me I think of people, especially boys- that they want me if I don‚Äôt have fat on my body. Even tho I know that people don‚Äôt care buuut I‚Äôm also afraid that if I put on weight- for example my class/school will think I‚Äôm getting super fat.

Hope someone understand, and have some helping advices‚Äô + do anyone have suggestions for a recovery book about this, like what happens to the body when it starts getting back to normal, or like what would happen to the body if it gets to bad.

kn4c6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/kn4c6p/anyone_else_here_without_bdd_i_am_aware_i_am_not/,"Anyone else here *without* BDD? I am aware I am not fat, and I'm moderately skinny... I just... Can't eat anymore?",14,2,1609342503.0,"So, maybe this is a guy thing, or maybe not, but I'm pretty sure I don't have body dysmorphia, I can look in the mirror and see where I've lost weight, I can see that I'm skinny, I can see where my bones are sticking out etc. It's weird but my eating disorder is not really all that centered around how I look, it's about extremely detailed numbers and control and OCD type behaviors etc... 

Yes I care about my weight, but I don't have a UGW or anything, I'm just thrilled when the number on the scale goes down and want to die when it goes up. Don't get me wrong, I hate what I look like and do think I have too much fat in certain places, but that is mostly me hating where the fat is distributed rather than thinking I am fat. I also want to be bigger in some areas (I want visible but lean muscles.) But I can't get around the fact that I need to eat more to gain muscles and the fact that I'd put on weight if I put on muscles. I also enjoy finding clothes that emphasize my skinniness and I can tell when clothing is flattering to my body and making me appear even smaller, or alternatively I know what to wear when seeing my treatment team to appear less skinny.

My eating disorder is more centered around self control, and not eating is the only tether I have to sanity and feeling like I have even the tiniest bit of control in my life with everything going on right now (there are too many details to get into it here, but believe me when I say there is an *intense* amount of stress in my life right now, like... *extreme*) 

At this point where I'm at, I think if I looked in the mirror and saw my ideal image of exactly what I want to look like down to every detail, I would still be starving myself. What I see in the mirror doesn't really matter to me anymore. I just can't eat, don't want to eat, won't let myself eat, and want to die when I do eat. 

And it's all about the numbers. My treatment people have been trying to get me to eat more from so many angles, but no matter what they suggest, all I care about is the amount of calories and I adjust the amounts I eat of their recommend foods to still fit within my numbers. I know it's counterproductive, but I can't handle going over the set in stone numbers in my head.

Does anyone else relate? I feel like I can't relate to a lot on online ED stuff because my ED seems different and then I feel like like even more of a useless hopeless lost cause failure of a human being :("

Everyone I've ever told, trusted enough to confide in, has pushed my problems away and told me it's not a big deal. When I told one of my mates, he laughed awkwardly and began joking about how only girls get anorexia, so I would be fine. When I told another friend that I wasn't doing well at all she just told me that she'd honestly never noticed and then never asked about it again. And when I told my best friend that this had all finally spiralled out of control and that restriction and over exercising had completely taken over, she didn't give a sh*t. She was happy to brag to me about her weight loss after a hospital stay, she was happy to tell me in vivid detail, how good it felt to be skinny again. And now I feel so sick talking to her. Because she knows what she did, and she doesn't care. But she used to, so when did my problems become just that, problems. Problems that she didn't want to deal with? Problems that no one wanted to deal with.

I've told two counsellors too. I went to them, pushing myself to finally seek out recovery. And they shunned me. One of them weighed me, whilst I was literally in school. And then forced me to look at a bmi chart and see that I wasn't sick yet. I wasn't skinny enough yet to have an eating disorder. She didn't care. The only adults I've ever told didn't care.

I remember a time, ( I was 12 years old ) where I would literally starve myself until I fell over. I started to loose my hair and everytime I got up, my eyes went black.
Then in summer, me and my parents went to Greece. We were at the airport and I could literally pull out my hair. I remember that look in my parents eyes. They were so scared, they couldn‚Äòt talk to me anymore.

A year had passed and I recovered. It wasn‚Äôt that hard back then, tbh.

I was healthy, I did a lot of sports and was eating well.
But AN still hadn‚Äòt disappeared in my head.

From 15 to 17 I had a little relapse again. I don‚Äòt know why, but somehow this feeling/disease never went away... but still, I didn‚Äòt have to go to the hospital or so...

And now... 18 yrs old, I‚Äòm literally on the verge of dispair. 
My best friend (met her in college) has bulimia, her sister had anorexia and I felt like I was only fighting my AN for her. I didn‚Äòt want her to think I had AN too. I know it would literally break her heart and make her feel even worse. But about a month ago I just couldn‚Äòt take it anymore. I felt so bad in my own skin, I couldn‚Äòt look at myself in the mirror anymore and I was weighing myself so much more often than I did before (4-5 times a day). I started starving myself again and something I never did and that scares me a lot... I started purging, which was the worst decision ever.
I‚Äòd say, I sometimes CAN control it and tell myself: DON‚ÄòT DO THIS TO YOURSELF, IT‚ÄòS DANGEROUS !

But it‚Äòs hard. Very hard.

And of course you can imagine how hard those Christmas days were. I didn‚Äòt spend one day without purging. It was just grueling.

Luckily I have someone, who helped me a lot.
But I have a lot of guilt towards him. He literally spent hours and hours trying to help me and trying to understand me... But I just could never follow his advice because it is so hard.

And you know what‚Äôs the worst?
I can‚Äòt even eat or drink anymore without weighing myself or purging until I lost enough weight. 
My parents are literally at the end of their rope and of course I feel extremely guilty because I do all this to them and I am their only child. 

It‚Äòs just terrible and I know I should get help.. but I‚Äôll soon have my finals and I need to make it, even though I know, it‚Äòll be hard.

Anyway... that was my story.
Unfortunately I lost a lot of weight and it‚Äòs becoming less everyday. It really scares me.

Thanks to all who took the time to read this. 
It means a lot to me."

My name is Elizabeth and I've struggled with anorexia basically since middle school. I spent a lot of my early 20's avidly working out and eating as little possible until I ended up in hospital.
I swore to never starve myself again after I recovered... and for about 6-8 years I was doing very well.

Recently I lost a lot of weight without realizing it and ended up sick again. It wasn't bad enough for a hospital trip this time, but it scared my girlfriend really badly. ( She's never seen me small before, though I have told her about what I struggle with )

It scares me too. I do and don't want to gain weight depending on when you may happen to ask. I feel euphoric when my stomach is grumbling or when I see my waist line in the mirror. I also feel ashamed when I can't lift things or hold up something mildly heavy without getting fatigued.

I guess I never learned much about my eating disorder because I thought it was over and done...

Just venting mostly. Feeling kind of alone in this."

I literally don‚Äôt know what a life without an ED would look like since my earliest memories were of mine.,33,11,1609228988.0,"THERE MIGHT BE SOME TRIGGERING CONTENT JN THIS IDK!!!

When I hear most people‚Äôs ED stories, more specifically anorexia stories, I notice their ED didn‚Äôt start at least until middle school.

 That was never the case for me. My earliest memories are me in 1st and 2nd grade hating my body. I would feel guilty even then eating. It was probably around 3rd grade I started restricting certain foods. I would always look for the option with the least calories. I remember wishing and trying to throw ip even that young, which is crazy looking back. 5th grade was probably my first case of minor ana. Middle school and early high school is when it got very bad, and when my ED story really started. 

It just kinda saddens me that my entire life has revolved around my hatred for my body, myself, and food. As I grew up, anorexia shifted from a way to punish myself and look better to a way to cope with life and my mental health. I am recovered enough for the last few years, although I find that I can never truly recover because I don‚Äôt know a life without anorexia. I just can‚Äôt remember a time when I didn‚Äôt have these thoughts. It wasn‚Äôt even that I was a large child, I was pretty slim and athletic. So I wanted to know if anyone else went though something similar or when your ED started? If if did start this early, do you have the same thoughts or how do you deal with it?"

i want to restrict so bad, i want to forget to eat bc of the stress, i want to feel full with a bite, but also, i just want to be fine with my body, i just want to look in the mirror and think i look good and desirable and pretty. but all i can see is fat, bloated, ugly, no ass no tits, not even a pretty face. i have nothing. im not smart, im not talented in any way. i dont have anything to hold on to"

klc5wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/klc5wt/is_it_true_that_eating_properly_and_restoring/,Is it true that eating properly and restoring weight will naturally decrease my ED thoughts?,6,4,1609105355.0,"I‚Äôve been in and out of different types of treatment since February this year. I was forced into treatment then and even now I‚Äôm still not really convinced that recovering is the right choice for me right now. I am underweight and have been restricting for over a year, during my time in treatment there has been a large focus on my weight and my need to gain restore weight. I‚Äôve always hated this focus and I‚Äôve felt it makes treatment really triggering (I never weighed myself during my ED and weight didn‚Äôt become an obsession for me until I entered treatment). 

However one thing treatment professionals repeat over and over to me is that getting to a healthy weight will naturally decrease my symptoms and make any remaining ED thoughts less difficult to handle. I was able to gain a little weight during a short involuntary IP stay, but I was still nowhere close to being weight restored. I did find that I couldn‚Äôt really see much of a difference in my body when I came home and had access to a full length mirror again, but other than that I don‚Äôt experience any reduction in my thoughts/urges. 

The only things that are really holding me back in terms of fully committing to recovery are weight gain (and how fast I‚Äôm convinced it will be), bloating, and extreme hunger. If I do decide to commit to recovering working with treatment professionals is unlikely to be an option for me due to my history with them. Is what they have said to me the truth? Or is it just a poly to convince me to fully weight restore when I‚Äôm currently not in a place where I feel comfortable going all the way with my weight restoration?"

Today when I saw I gained weight I felt like I wanted to relapse and not eat anything in weeks. So I'm forcing myself to remember why I want to recover, and share it with you because why not?

1. My hair: I used to have the brightest and healthiest hair and now it is so brittle and bad-looking. I want my hair back.

2. My body hair: This lanugo bs is going to drive me insane. I don't want it anymore.

3. My body shape: I KNOW skinny isn't the answer. I KNOW I don't want to be built like a fucking door. I KNOW I want my tits back. I KNOW I want my ass back. I don't care if some 14 year old with a meanspo blog has written the opposite on Tumblr. Nobody likes bodies that are as severely underweight as mine. And I want to use my old bras again.

4. My mom: I don't want her to suffer anymore because of me.

5. My dad: He likes when I suffer. He laughs when I refuse to eat. When I'm in a bad day, he laughs at my mom because she's suffering. I won't let him win.

6. My future: I want to be an independent adult and if I can't even EAT how the fuck I'm gonna live alone.

7. My social life: I don't want to lose anymore friends because I'm so fucking scared of an ice cream cone that I don't hang out with them.

8. My period: Idgaf if it felt like a knife on my lower back. I miss it. I miss the feeling of ""oh, when I grow up I could have children"" even if I never wanted children.

9. My skin: I have never had porcelain skin. But the mess I have in my face right now is gross. And I have to remember that it was worse when I weighed less.

10. My grades: I still get good grades, but Idk how much I'm gonna be able to keep them high if I need to read 50 times each phrase to fit it in my head because I'm too busy thinking about how could I eat less than xx calories for dinner.

I think I just want to die. Have a heart attack or organ failure. Maybe I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll end up on life support or something and come back from it and suddenly want to live. At my best I‚Äôm just sort of putting off suicide a few more years instead of thinking of it as an immediate option. At my worst I end up back in the hospital for suicidal ideation and whatnot. Ideation. I hate myself for being all talk and no bite. Like a failure because I haven‚Äôt -actually- tried to kill myself. 

I feel like such a piece of shit. Worthless. Pointless. A fraud. I have this amazing job in which I help people with mental health issues, and I‚Äôm a fraud. I keep feeling like an imposter and my dietician recently pointed out that I kind of am. I‚Äôm helping people and encouraging them to get better, while in secret, I‚Äôm making myself worse. Diet pills. Psyllium husk. Lying about having eaten. I live alone so it‚Äôs pretty easy to get away with it. Is anorexia a choice? What does that say about me, that I‚Äôm choosing sickness? Attention-seeking? I realized this week that I‚Äôve struggled to eat for five years. Most of that was very secretive. Now this year I told people and am diagnosed with anorexia. And I love that. My fucked up twisted brain. 

My dietician said this week that my ‚ÄúED voice‚Äù is louder and more intrusive and stubborn than anybody else she works with. And I was PROUD of that. Fuck. Me. I must be a real piece of shit. 

And yet, I‚Äôm nowhere near the weight I want to be. Know I could be at. My BMI is still in the green, at least for a few more pounds. I‚Äôve seen the signs of sickness in me when it wasn‚Äôt. People asking, ‚ÄúHey... aren‚Äôt you looking kinda skinny?‚Äù My hair falling out in handfuls, my tightest pants requiring a belt. Then I started eating more and my hair stopped falling out after some time. And guess what? I‚Äôm upset about that. It‚Äôs not a sign of progress. ‚ÄúProgress.‚Äù 

Anyways. I just feel sad and weak and like a piece of shit. The reality is that I just want to be sick. I don‚Äôt want to get better. I tell my dietician every week. I tell her I‚Äôm wasting her time. Wasting my time. But I think I like the self-pity-party. Watch me burn, ya‚Äôll. I hope this either kills me or makes me finally want to live."

Yesterday though, not so much. I woke up not feeling great about myself or my body. I wanted to restrict but, I tired to be smart and eat. So, I did. I ordered myself lunch, I wasn‚Äôt too impressed by it but it was still tasty. But, as the day went on, things started to get a hell of a lot worse.

I‚Äôm just sitting in my room, my housemate is spending time with his family and I just start doing body checks. It eventually led to me relapsing with self-harm and that just made me feel worse. I don‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt want to but I didn‚Äôt know how else I was supposed to release it all. 

I ended up going on a run and just having a full blown breakdown on the shoulder. My sweatpants were covered in mud, I was sweaty and gross, my face was all puffy and gross. I felt gross, I wanted to hide, I wanted to scream, I wanted to jump into moving traffic.

When I came home, I realized I didn‚Äôt have my keys. So, I knocked on the door. No response, I get up to just go back out and run. But, my roommate opened the door and I just ran to the basement and absolutely LOST IT.

The lego set that I adored and spent 4 days building, yeeted across the room. My head was pounding, I was tired and hungry. I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.

This is making recovery extremely difficult. I‚Äôm struggling with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and just overall upset stomach. 
From certain articles I‚Äôve read it seems the thing to do is slowly Introduce food back in to your diet and consistently eat throughout the day. Basically just to push through the nausea and tough it out and wait for your body to adjust. This is what I have been doing for the past week. 

Before this I was eating at most one small meal a day since June. This progressed to eating a very small snack or nothing . I have now tried to eat several times a day and am always nauseous... especially at night. 

Anyone one else deal with this? I really just need hope that this gets better or advice on how you got through it... I‚Äôm emetophobic so being nauseous is so triggering to me and makes me want to fall back in to not eating and restricting again. 
I‚Äôve read that this gastroparesis is reversible in people with EDs, but have also read some people live with this for the rest of their life. The thought of this being life long causes me to have suicidal thoughts, I can‚Äôt do this forever. Please help :("

It's one thing not being able to take compliments (or not being able to believe them), but I honestly just hate when they make me feel even worse about myself."

They're the fucking food police. It's like I'm 14 again and I can't deal with this right now. I'm in grad school and genuinely don't have time for this shit.

I'm starving. I was in recovery before this and now I'm suddenly down to a sick weight again and there's absolutely nothing I can do because I'm literally not allowed to eat when my body wants to eat. I'm tempted to sneak into the kitchen right now and grab some food because I have this massively important project to finish tonight and I'm too fucking exhausted and malnourished to have a single coherent thought. I look like I'm dying again and none of this would have happened if I hadn't had to move in with my family.

Another thing too is even with all this restricting, im still considered a healthy weight for my BMI. I know this is good but it makes me feel like my disorder isn't real. If im really anorexic shouldn't I be underweight? It's like my body hits a low weight and WON'T budge no matter how little I eat.

For about 3 months, I ate almost nothing, and I am extremely worried that I won‚Äôt grow as much as I should. Even now, whenever I think I have eaten enough throughout the day, I start to feel very hungry when I go to sleep, and I feel guilty that I haven‚Äôt eaten enough. I‚Äôm trying to eat more proteins, and have more meals throughout the day, but I am still worried. I‚Äôm 13 and male, and I know this is the time where I am supposed to eat the most, I am also trying to eat more before I go to sleep, but I‚Äôm still afraid it‚Äôs not enough. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you.

Some background, I was diagnosed with AN this summer and was involountarily committed for about 8 weeks. Then I was transfered to an IOP, which I didn't want to attend.

So I got a job and moved out of my parents house. I don't regret it at all, being independent is great. I quit the outpaitent programme and relapsed. Hard. 

I never told anyone except my boyfriend I left treatment, but I'm sure my family suspects it. I'm almost back at my LW, which I can't hide no matter how much baggy clothing I wear. 

Now, how this relates to Christmas. I'm seeing my family over the holidays ('rona precausions taken and local regulations followed) and not only is the whole food situation a nightmare on it's own, the thought of being confronted about my ED/treatment progress (or lack therof) is terrifying.

My family are almost all on the larger side and plates typically loaded with food. Not only are there often a lot of comments about the amount someone else is eating, but endless offering of more food (no is apperantly not a valid answer, we all know how grandmas are). 

I feel like I'll be watched under a microscope, every food I choose and every bite I take will be analyzed and judged. Of course they mean well, but the food is already so scary.

I don't know how to cope. I guess I could talk to them beforehand and ask them to do/not do certain things, but I also don't want to bring up the elephant in the room. 

I hope I've made some sense, at least it felt theraputic to write out my thoughts. I wish you all a happy holiday and hope the burden of this illness won't weigh too heavy on your shoulders this season‚ù§"

 i've always had a weird relationship with suffering- when i was a kid, i would self harm because i felt that it made me ""pure"" of my sins. but eventually, i started fantasizing about giving into my addiction to the point where i would be hospitalized, or absolutely covered in scars. i have no fucking idea why- and it's not like i've outgrown it, i feel the fucking same about my eating disorder. i love- the attention?? i got into an accident a few days ago, and i had to eat a bit more if i wanted any hope of healing- a friend of mine (the same guy who encouraged me to ""diet"" in the first place) had to literally BEG me to eat. it felt... amazing. it took so long for him to realize that i had an eating disorder (he told me, many times, that i couldn't have Anorexia because i wasn't underweight, which hurt- a lot) and to hear him literally beg me to eat something?? god, it was like a high. it was amazing. today, i could hear the pain in my mom's voice when she asked me if i had eaten. i didn't feel too bad about lying, because she was being homophobic and horrible earlier- that's not really the point. it's... so, so fucked up that i was fine with making her worry like that. i almost passed out in walmart, and i was FINE with it! in fact- i kinda wish i had. maybe someone would care. it's- horrible, to read all that typed out??? i feel horrible- people always say that people starve themselves for attention, which is ridiculous! and yet here i am, reinforcing that horrible stereotype by my actions. i'm sorry, this is really rambly and it doesn't make a lot of sense. i just needed to confess all of this- its okay to think i'm a monster, i would too. thank you, to anyone who reads through it all."

Ever since I was maybe 11 (I‚Äôm 22f now) my mother made comments about my body. Telling me I need to suck in my stomach, do sit ups, stop eating so much etc. It made it hard to love my body and I definitely have a warped perception of what I look like (despite knowing I‚Äôm skinny.) 

When I have a depressive episode I stop eating. I lost a lot of weight this last month because of it and part of me thought maybe I looked better. To be clear I wasn‚Äôt starving myself because I wanted to look good. I wasn‚Äôt eating because my depression was convincing me I didn‚Äôt deserve to and that if I stopped eating eventually I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. However, an unexpected outcome has made me question if I would look better being thinner especially since my mother made comments about how much better I look. 

I‚Äôm in therapy for my depression and anxiety and I told my therapist how I was starving myself and she made me sign a no harm contract so I have to force myself to eat. 

Meanwhile, my boyfriend has been sending me drawings he‚Äôs done where the women are extremely skinny and it makes me feel very self conscious and not good looking enough for him. He didn‚Äôt mean any harm by it, I haven‚Äôt brought up anything regarding my eating habits or lack thereof when I‚Äôm depressed.

I‚Äôm just so confused about what is going on with me. I‚Äôve been doing better. I‚Äôve ate three meals a day for a week now but I‚Äôm mostly doing it because I signed a contract with my therapist and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint her.

or they will come to me for weight loss tips. like i‚Äôm not the person to be going to at all for that. my favorite one is when people text me and tell me that they are just not going to eat to lose weight. and i get v worked up over it bc i would hate to have the shit that im going through happen to someone i care about bc this is by far the worst thing that has ever happened to me. there was really no point to this post and i doubt anyone will reply or read and that‚Äôs alright i just wanted to put this out there since i don‚Äôt have any other type of outlet. but if you did read thank you for taking the time out of ur day and who knows maybe someone else can relate to me in someway"

We got off a video call and he text me after to say ""you looked skinny on video. I hope you're eating."" 

I've been beyond stressed out lately, sleeping, eating, doing anything has been impossible without me even trying to restrict. It's been the last thing on my mind for the last month or no due to so many more important things. 

After he said that tho the competitive ED side of my brain came to life with validation, this morning I jumped on the scales to see how much weight I really lost amidst all this stress. 

I promised him I was trying my best but since I stepped on that scale part of me doesn't want to try. The ED part of me feels like all the misery and stress of the last month - 6 weeks has given it a leg up for me to restrict since I struggle to eat right now anyway and I'm already losing weight and people are noticing. 

I've been in recovery for 5 years and the urges never ever went away but I was always able to physically control myself. Now I'm not so sure."

Hey everyone,

I have really bad anxiety and emetophobia and when I eat I feel like I'm about to v\*mit and can't swallow because it will come back up - I know it's not real nausea but rather caused by anxiety, but it actually happened before, I ignored the feeling and swallowed anyway and then gagged.

It's been like that for a long time, since I started recovery and begun eating even when I didn't want to (I've been in recovery for 7 months now). Does anyone else experience this? does anyone have advice?"

I look at pictures from myself a year ago and I feel nauseous. Even though I looked healthier, I never want to get back to that weight again. 

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm proud of losing weight bc I know the people around me are concerned. Every single adult I talk to makes sure to mention it. It‚Äôs just frustrating because now I hate myself for being too thin while also feeling so massive.

So now I'm really conflicted because one part of me obviously wants to keep losing weight and stay skinny but the other part desperately wants to gain weight to look better to others. It's really hard having these two extremes and I feel like its lead to a no win situation, I'm just miserable if I gain weight or if I don't. I worry though that if I'm not as insecure about how I look now I won't have as much motivation or as much of a driving force to combat the ED.

So my question is, what helped you guys stay motivated to get better? Has anyone else dealt with this? And if anyone has any general advice I'd appreciate it. Thanks."

I've spoken to him about this a while back and we do give each other space. But with lockdown, the only space I get is when I am out the house. I feel like I cant enjoy a day in my own house because he is there. 

Does anyone else have these stresses and anxieties? I'm jot sure if it's related to ED or something else."

Although I have put on a substantial amount of weight, I now see my body as a whole and can see that I am not overweight by any means. When I had anorexia I only saw my body as fat, when this definitely was not true. I feel as if I could only see my body in parts and because I could not see it as a whole it looked much bigger than it actually was. I am wondering if anyone else has observed this?"

(We‚Äôre fortunate enough to have good health care in case things take a turn) But basically my parents have been extra on my ass about eating.

I also work in a research lab. Long story short, I handled this situation completely and utterly terribly. I was embarrassed to tell the lab that I wouldn't be able to do work (all remote anyway.) So, instead, I did something far worse and just missed four weeks of weekly meetings and ignored every email and text I got from the two people I work with most closely. The fact that everything is virtual made it easier for me to enable my anxiety and completely avoid the entire situation. My work wasn't really pertinent to others, as it is my own project, but I'm so upset with myself for how I handled this. It was incredibly rude and irresponsible. I need to reach out to them and explain what happened but I don't know how to approach this. I've been been in knots about this for the entire month which has lead to avoidance. I would appreciate any advice... what is appropriate to mention, how to best apologize, if I do disclose my ED how to best prepare for potential judgement, etc. (I'm also not incredibly thin so I'm anxious about people thinking oh, she's fat and has an ED?)  This is part of something that I currently have drafted about why I didn't reach out, but it doesn't seem right. I don't want to be dramatic or overshare (should I even mention the ED thing) but also feel obligated to say what happened at this point. I'm concerned about being judged for the eating disorder, but most importantly, losing respect because of how I dealt with the situation. Please try to refrain from admonishing me because I am aware that there were much better ways of dealing with the situation.

""I don't want to overshare but at this point I feel like it's most appropriate to let you know that I was in treatment for an eating disorder. I didn't expect to be gone but I 100% should have reached out a long time ago. I didn't have much time to do much aside from essential assignments for my other classes. I was embarrassed that I couldn't work and about the reason why, and didn't know how to approach the topic, so I just didn't."""

We're all struggling. We're stressed, exhausted, both physically and mentally. We're harming ourselves and we know it full well yet we're trapped and can't do anything about it. That's not because we're failures. That's not because we want to be sick. That's not our fault. 

We're manipulated by the voice in our minds.

It may not be the same voice, it may not sound the same, hell, it might not even whisper the same things but one thing for sure is that it's keeping us under an illusion that it has created for us. It's making us go by its rules so we could stay. So we could stay with it and never try and defy it.

Don't ever blame yourself for feeling like you're wishing this upon yourself. Because it's not you, it's IT.

We're on the same boat yet we're going different ways. We're so similar yet so different. 

Either we weigh ourselves everyday or run away from the scale. We pick at our food and swirl it around or we divide it to smaller pieces so it'd seem less intimidating. Either we eat then beat ourselves up for it or we throw the food away. We compensate for a ""bad day of eating."" We fast or we restrict, or both. We act like everything is fine and then we break down at night, or we remain empty. We feel full just eating a few bites or no matter what, we can't satisfy our hunger. We panic at the mention of food or we can't wait to eat that one meal for the day. We love food but we hate it. We enjoy it for a moment but then we feel like we made a mistake. We count calories as if it's the most important thing in the world. We're obsessed. We're driven by the need to just catch a glimpse of the slightest change on the scale. We deprive ourselves of our cravings because... I feel like we all know that one lol.

Passing a grocery aisle where we see so many tasty looking things and we just stare. We stare at them with longing, with a softened gaze, as if we're looking for a sign of comfort. We invalidate our eating habits because it's ""not that bad yet,"" ""we're not sick enough yet,"" ""we haven't reached our goal yet."" YET. When will we ever reach our goal? When will we be sick enough? When is this ""yet?""

We never stop belittling what we're going through. Mind you, we belittle our progress as well. Cause even when we take the smallest step towards recovery (we all have tried that, don't even try to pretend you haven't) just for ONE day, we feel great but then the next we're compensating as if we'd made a grave mistake. We feel like it wasn't enough. And we invalidate it. Belittle it. And quite frankly, we make it seem like it was just fall rather than it was an attempt to rise. Even that small fucking step that we suddenly feel brave enough to take, no matter how small it is, we belittle it.

We want to feel hunger pangs, it means we've done well. We want our legs to shake, it means we've done well. We want to be sicker but NO WE DON'T.

IT wants us to be sicker. IT wants us to feel hungry so it'd congratulate us like we achieved something great when in reality, that something isn't great at all. It might be so for IT but not us.

I'm not saying this so it'd ""Oh so suddenly cure you!"" Cause believe me, I don't have the power to heal myself let alone help anyone. The only reason I'm saying this is because I want you to realize a few things: 

1) Whatever rules you go by, whatever rules your ED sets for you, no matter how ridiculous they are, they are valid. You're not ""stupid"" You're not ""dumb.""

2) Your struggle with your ED doesn't have to be the same as someone else's. It's YOUR eating disorder. So don't compare, and don't invalidate what you're going through just because someone has it ""worse.""

3) You're not alone. We're all struggling, different circumstances, different rules, different reasons, different actions but in the end, we want to same goal. 

So no, you're not invalid because you love bananas and ""peOpLe WiTh ED's fEaR bAnAnaS."" You're not invalid because you eat more calories than another, HECK, you're not invalid because you don't restrict. Maybe you eat your recommended calorie intake, but it's the thoughts that prove you're not okay. You're not invalid because you're not underweight, that's a fucking stereotype that needs to be wiped out. Anorexia is a MENTAL disorder before it's physical. It can take years to show physical symptoms but seconds to show mental ones.

If you're at a healthy weight, or you're overweight, you don't have ""atypical anorexia"" that's literally a term that belittles your struggles and a nicer way to say, ""you're not anorexic but you'll be there one day,"" which... *sigh*
I don't wanna get too much into the atypical anorexia thing cause I rightfully have bad blood with this term and if I start I won't stop lol so let's just end it right there. You don't have atypical anorexia, you have anorexia nervosa. Last time I checked, it was a MENTAL ILLNESS not a ""wait till I check if you're underweight to determine that.""

Thoughts are thoughts. And those thoughts will have you act upon them. And when you do that, you create disordered habits that aren't normal, therefore, you're struggling just like the rest. Weight doesn't fucking decide anything.

4) The surge of courage and urge to recover you suddenly get out of nowhere, and then you get up and eat something impulsively, that is a valid step. It's not a binge, it's not a mistake. And to recover, you need to keep taking that step. Not just once, not twice, not thrice but EVERYDAY. So even if you fail to take it everyday, even if you fail to take it at all, it's okay. The thought counts too. Baby steps are valid. Falling a million times counts as long as you keep getting up. I don't care if you take a staggering step only once a month. It still counts. 

STOP INVALIDATING ANYTHING YOU DO CAUSE IT COUNTS. EVERYTHING COUNTS.

And please, don't blame yourself. We already have so much on our plates (ironically) and we don't need self-blaming as the cherry on top.

Y'all, take care of yourselves and best of luck to all of us‚ù§Ô∏è"

i am a heavier set gal which means me losing weight is seen as a good thing, its seen that im taking better care of myself and am overall becoming a healthier person. so when i went in for my med-check (for said adderall)  and they say that i lost way to much weight for the two month gap between the last time i was there, instead of being concerned about the meds working to well or me relapsing the nurse and the doctor congratulated me about it. 

 i think that its horrible the double standard on eating disorders. like, if they are already small and skinny and they start to loose weight rapidly that's concerning. but if you are overweight or bigger and you start loosing weight rapidly you are congratulated for being so in control and healthy.

my therapist saw me two days ago, and could tell basically right away that i lost *a lot* of weight since i saw her the week before. she seemed worried and concerned, an amount of worry and concern i haven‚Äôt seen from anyone before regarding my health. i know i‚Äôm getting really bad and i‚Äôm probably not that far from having to look into treatment (my guess.) long story short, she thinks it would be a good idea to tell my best friend who i also live with. i‚Äôm terrified to for a few reasons, them being 1. i don‚Äôt want them to think it‚Äôs an ‚Äúanti-fat‚Äù thing, and 2. i‚Äôm terrified of recovery and people constantly hovering and watching over me. all that being said, how do i tell them, or even bring it up?"

What do you guys think? What should I do?

A little background info: When i first began losing weight it was a result of being broke, starting to smoke, and has honestly lost my appetite. There were no prior thoughts of wanting to lose weight despite my being over weight. Over time, i started seeing results from my unintentional fasting and this is when it became a conscious thought/decision to keep my food intake low, etc. I consider myself to have been recovered for about a year, not from the thoughts, just the restriction. 

In the last 6 months or so my mindset has changed in regards to my body & the way i see it. I don‚Äôt see it for it‚Äôs size the way i used and try to do what is actually best for me. It has been so awesome to see how far i‚Äôve come in those thoughts since making a concious effort to change. 

However, i recently lost my appetite again. Nothing sounds good, worth making or buying. 

For a normal college student this could be chalked up to stress or being busier than normal and i wish i could do that & leave it that but i cannot. 

I find myself stressing more now that ive lost my appetite than i was stressing about restricting when i was in my ed. 

I have come SO far in this journey of self love and healing and its taken a long time to accept my body & treat her well. I am terrified of losing all of this progress to a lack of appetite but i can‚Äôt find the motivation/hunger to eat. On the other hand i wanted so badly for so long to be skinny again so that side of my brain is telling me to take this opportunity and run. Literally.

I know a few people who take them and they've definitely gained a bit, some more than others. 

The thing is although I'm not diagnosed I'm 90% sure I have AN since it's pretty much the way I act towards food (restricting, exercising, etc) and I haven't told a soul about this, I'm not ready. I'm not underweight yet so I thought I could buy some more time before going into recovery and having to go back to a healthy weight. I'm really, really scared. I know this would be good for me, but still. 

So if anyone out there has gone through the same thing, how did it go? Did you gain much weight, is it easy to lose it? Does having more energy to do things make it easier to exercise and lose the pounds you may put on? My mind is a mess right now."

My older sister who has recovered quite a few years ago has moved in with me a few days ago and I'm quite worried. I've relapsed and I'm scared I'll either trigger her with my behaviour or she'll realise that I have since she knows the signs. 
I've tried just eating normally but it's so hard. Before she arrived, which was not planned and happened within a matter of hours, I had gone a number of days heavily restricting. Since she's arrived she's been pushing all kinds of food on me like cakes and ice creams while talking about me skipping meals like breakfast. 
It's making me extremely frustrated and only making me more reluctant to eat. I am extremely panicked because she's so pushy, having me eat high calorie foods, pointing out my eating habits and not allowing me to stick to my schedule it even really having any time to myself, thereby preventing me to exercise. I've tried to have her give me space but she becomes offended so easily. It's making me want to fast so bad, I'm so panicky and I don't know what to do.

I still weigh myself a lot but it‚Äôs never bothered me much. (I‚Äôm working on not, because that is what triggered me today) 

I weighed myself today after a couple days of not eating due to stress and medication.

I wish I could say I‚Äôm proud of myself for eating tonight but it‚Äôs just furthering my fears. I thought I was ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù but I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm definitely not. I had just made a deal with myself that as long as I wasn‚Äôt underweight but not above a very specific weight I would be fine. I maintained this for quite a while with little problem. Today I‚Äôm very close to what I deem ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and now have set an even lower ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù weight in my own head... 

I can‚Äôt afford therapy and I do believe I can keep myself out of inpatient if I just don‚Äôt spiral. I‚Äôm just really struggling right now, and needed to post it somewhere I would be understood.

i wish i was able to talk about it. part of me wants to say how much weight i‚Äôve lost and mention how little i‚Äôm eating but also want to cry for help and get validation of what i‚Äôm going through. 

in july when i was in recovery my boyfriend broke up with me without any closure and in the same week my whole friend group ghosted me without telling me any reason why and completely stopped replying to my messages.

i only have my parents to talk to and i don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking them about it because my dad constantly will talk about the new diets he‚Äôs trying and how hard it is. 

like i had said, part of me wants to get attention about it and another wants help and to support me going through all this and get encouragement when i do something good towards recovery. but i don‚Äôt have a single person to talk to about it (at least comfortably without damaging my relationship with family) 

is there any way to get free or cheap support in recovery where i can talk to other people who feel alone also? i don‚Äôt want to compare illnesses and i can‚Äôt afford any IOP or residential sadly. 

i just recently discovered this sub and i know i just posted something yesterday but i have nowhere else to vent and you guys are wonderful people <3"

I saw my mum try to slit her wrists after an argument with her and I was terrified for months she was going to kill her self as she‚Äôd randomly walk out in arguments and not come home for 30 minutes or whatever. She‚Äôs speed in the car and said I‚Äôll kill us both. She refuses she ever needs help and I got CPS involved and they did nothing. Twice. 

I can‚Äôt recover with this. I‚Äôm trapped. 

I‚Äôm not allowed to cook anything, or have any say in what I eat despite being more than capable of it. They‚Äôre keeping me ill.

Before I get into the story it‚Äôs important to know why I have an eating disorder, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm lonely. I don‚Äôt have any friends, not a single one. I‚Äôm not particularly good looking but I‚Äôm not pretty either. My logic is even though a have a great personality and sense of humor, it‚Äôs being so fat and ugly that‚Äôs keeping me from having friends. I truly believe that if I was prettier and skinner, people might give me a chance, even if it‚Äôs only for my looks at first. Pretty people always have friends. Always.

I started purging in October, it started mild at first but now it‚Äôs several times a day. Over that time I‚Äôve began to notice my teeth slowly yellowing but not by much. See my teeth have always been one of my favorite parts of myself. All my life I‚Äôve looked forward to dentist appointments just for the self confidence boosts. My ultimate goal is to be pretty, yellow teeth are not pretty. You can probably imagine the pain I felt when my mom looks literally gasped at the state of my mouth.

Purging is ruining my teeth, the one happiness in my life, so I‚Äôm quitting. I‚Äôm quitting purging forever. 

This isn‚Äôt going to be easy, but I‚Äôll do it for the sake of the one thing I still love. (On the plus side it‚Äôll probably stop me from binging, which I‚Äôve been trying to do :D)

Save your teeth peeps, don‚Äôt purge"

Some people see ana as an imposter urge, something pretending that it‚Äôs essential to us when it‚Äôs in fact dangerous. I see ana not as an urge NOT to eat but rather as in obstruction in my urge TO eat. More of a road block that your car gets stuck on or hair snagging on a button.

Some parts of me want it so bad and want to loose the weight. And each day that desire gets stronger and I can‚Äôt control it.

I'm not eating a lot. I'm not going to say specifically how much because I know from personal experience that this subject is kind of competitive, and I don't want anyone thinking they have to go down to my level or that mine isn't low enough to be talking about this. Just know that it's not a lot.

I've been at this for about 3 weeks now, gradually lowering my calorie intake the first week and I've been at around the same number I ended on of that week. Half of me knows what I'm doing isn't healthy but the other half doesn't want to stop. I'm so close to my ""goal"" but what happens when I get there? I can't keep eating the same amount or I'll continue to lose weight far beyond the point I want to be at. On the other hand, if I start eating any more I'll gain weight like crazy because by this point I've fucked up my metabolism. Even if I was happy with the weight I'm at the issue still applies.

I hate looking at myself with a burning passion. My cheeks are too chubby my arms are too flabby my stomach isn't flat enough my legs are too big around. I have constant thoughts of wanting to take a knife to slice it all off and for a whole week I refused to look in mirrors. I started doing it again because it was just impractical but now I feel like I should go back just to stop the spirals of self loathing. 

People's first reaction to this would probably be to tell me to tell my parents, but that's not going to work. They already know. My mom's been watching me in the morning to make sure I eat breakfast and last night she made me eat dinner in the living room to do the same. I ended up releasing the food in me immediately after dinner, but I don't want to keep doing that because hurts and if I do it enough it's going to mess up my teeth. My parents didn't watch me eat dinner tonight so I was able to get away with not eating any tonight.

It's just going to get harder to keep this up. My parents are going to keep watching me eat and once the second semester starts at school they'll start charging lunch bills again. My two options are to not buy the food and my mom sees that her balance isn't lowering, or I buy the food and throw if away which would be incredibly wasteful.

I've tried talking to my friends about this, but their reaction is always ""stop it, you're not fat"" which isn't really helping. I don't know what I'm doing, or if I can do anything at all.

It's has been a while and she's doing good, she's eating a bit every day, but recently she's been getting a bit worse. She saw a picture of a girl with skinny legs and that trigger immediately made her want to fast again, and then she said she is going to again and there's nothing I can do about it. I talk to her every day for 7 hours on discord with the camera on etc. I love her so much but I can't physically be there to help her and it's killing me inside. She thinks she doesn't have a problem and doesn't want to talk to me about it at all. She keeps denying that there is something wrong. Even with such limited power, she told me she doesn't want to relapse because of me, she says I do help with her disorder, but now she's back to denying that she has a problem. She has this warped body image which I guess a lot of you are familiar with. Even if she relapses I'm not sure her mom would notice, she's not very involved.

If any of you have recovered what helped you?

If so is there anything I can do? Should I just leave it or should I try to help her and talk to her?

What can I do to help, is my main question."

Even though my body fat percentage is in the Olympic athlete range, whenever I look at my body all I see is fat; and because I exercise obsessively and restrict food intake as much as I can, if I step on the scale and haven't lost a decent amount of weight since my last weigh in, I feel crippling shame & guilt and double my efforts to lose more.

I'm spiralling out of control and don't know how I'm supposed to recover from this when the image in my head of how fat I am is so severe, it might kill me."

It‚Äôs still pretty recent, only about a month, but I‚Äôve been noticing changes in my body since I‚Äôve started eating again. This is normal of course, but as I‚Äôm recovering I realized I wasn‚Äôt as unaffected by my restrictive diet as I thought I was. I was eating only once a day for about two years before I went through a three month period of barely eating that lead up to my seeking recovery. I hadn‚Äôt noticed until recently how much hair I was losing when I was restricting. It never came out in clumps, but I got so used to shedding a significant amount of hair that I assumed it was normal and I was fine. I had noticed that my hair was appearing thinner, but I assumed this was a temporary period of hair loss brought on by stress. It wasn‚Äôt until very recently, since eating normally for a few weeks, that I noticed I‚Äôm only losing about a quarter of the hair I had been. Furthermore, just the brief three months of heavily restricting my eating has effectively stopped my period and I‚Äôm still waiting for it; it has been over two months since my last one. The point of this post is to warn everyone still restricting that you might not be as okay as you think you are.

I really needed a place to vent because I have been suppressing and bottling up my feelings for a very long long time now. I have had disordered thoughts and behaviors for about a year or more now, but I've never gotten *here*, and it's worse than ever.

I have been fasting with a certain minimum amount of time (I don't know if I can say it on here) in between my meals and of course I have struggled to avoid binging everytime I end a fast. Tonight was a binge night. I have never felt more depressed and more sad in my life.

I've fallen into full anorexia at this point and eating while fasting makes me very scared. I'm so afraid of breaking my ketosis that I don't drink tea or coffee. And when I do end my fasts without a binge, I have to control every single calorie. I can't go over a certain amount (which I probably can't tell either).

I'm so scared of logging the food. I feel broken. I want to fast forever. I've started a very long one to punish myself. I want to push away everyone I know and love. I feel like I'll never ever love myself. I feel love-starved and I wish I had someone who was just the perfect amount of close to me to talk about this.

But all I can do is try and gulp down the tears and think about how I will forever be a spiteful stranger towards myself. Because I can't be anything else, now can I? Tell me that you wouldn't wish for yourself to starve if tou were me. Tell me that you're worth the food, and that I should believe I am too.

I won't believe you anyways, but... At least one of us said it."

When you're in class and doing sooooo good at a certain subject, the teacher appreciates all your efforts, keeps complimenting you, and encourages you to keep going. 

So what do you do? You push yourself harder because you don't want to let the teacher down. You're so used to being excellent in that subject, especially in your teacher's eyes, that you can't really bring yourself to lack. 

That's how it is. That's especially why most of us just can't stop. 

ED is a teacher. He teaches you, grades your work, and encourages you to keep doing good in his class. Meaning, he tells you what to do to lose weight, counts how many calories you take in and how many you burn, and compliments you when you lose weight or keep your calories low, which in return makes you want to keep doing ""well."""

k2z1ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/k2z1ru/was_there_something_strange_about_how_my_former/,Was there something strange about how my former primary care physician dealt with my situation?,3,2,1606609171.0,"(20M) I‚Äôve had a particular source of stress that has been bothering me so much over the last five years and It‚Äôs gotten a lot worse since January. The toll it has taken on my mental health involves post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and the onset of an ED April 2020. I think the source of the stress triggers and fuels the AN because it is an obsession involving having been harmed in a personal way by a doctor a long time ago, and I think I use the restricting and exercise as an outlet for the obsessive and intrusive thoughts and the anger, and to try to make myself feel better about my body because I feel that I have been permanently physically damaged. Maybe it makes me feel in control since the nature if the harm involves my body, and it happened when I was very young and helpless.

Between April to August, especially catalyzed by the isolation, the AN took form and it changed the way I dealt with food and I compulsively exercised by running distances every day. I didn‚Äôt think I had AN at first but it kind of made sense when I really wanted to eat but I kept resisting the temptations and I didn‚Äôt know why, and when I obsessively weighed myself multiple times a day and lost a relatively significant amount of weight over the 4 months.

I reached out to my PCP mostly because I wanted to see if I could get an opinion letter from her about the root cause of the stress (since it involves medical malpractice and I‚Äôm taking action about it, so I thought a letter from her about how it‚Äôs affecting my mental health could be useful for my complaint/case). Also my parents were getting alarmed about the weight loss and wanted me to get in touch with the physician, who I had been under the care of for ~8 years. I have had no history with mental health care in the past, and the only other reasons I‚Äôve contacted her were for my breathing/allergy problems and sleep hygiene.
The PCP is female and probably in her 40s. My family has had good experiences with her.

I sent an email on August 29th to my PCP detailing my problem‚Äîthe source of the stress, and a hint about the ED but without explicitly saying it, I was hoping she would pick up on it and address it. I didn‚Äôt plan on being transparent with her about the ED but I did want to bring it to her because it is a big piece of the stress and I thought she could help me with my problem if I told her. Since I‚Äôm trying to take action about the medical malpractice that caused these mental health problems, I thought it could be a lot more compelling for my case to be upfront about what  health problems have flowed from the issue, an that if she made an opinion letter for me the ED could be useful information.

Here is the relevant part of the email:
‚ÄúOver the past few months [the stress from the issue] has manifested physically as compulsive dieting, exercising, calorie counting, and weight loss. I lost __ lb since April (my height is _‚Äô _‚Äù from ___ lb to ___ lb). I have been feeling tired lately, faint/dizzy when I stand up, and sometimes it is hard to think clearly. I understand how dangerous this is and I am aware of what is going on. I know that these behavioural patterns are not a good way to channel my pain and anger.‚Äù

I sent this when I reached a crisis point at the end of August and I felt like I was spiralling. I sent this to the doctors office at which she practices on August 29th (with my name, ATTENTION: physician name, and ‚Äúplease send email notes to physician‚Äù). I had to phone call them FOUR TIMES asking them to forward it to my doctor, and they kept saying they couldn‚Äôt find the email. I forwarded it multiple times, once after each call when they said they couldn‚Äôt find it.

You‚Äôd think that when someone is in a crisis and is sharing sensitive information critical for my physician to help me, and with a somewhat precarious/semi-urgent problem, this would get to the physician in a timely manner right? No‚Äîit finally reached her on September 20th. (nothing changed about the email, it was sent to the correct address). The email was sent successfully the first time. Talk about jumping through hoops just to get an important email to the PCP who needs it in order to help me.

On Sep 1st I had a phone appointment with her and we inly discussed the anxiety. I did not disclose the subject/medical malpractice stress source with her nor the ED habits because I thought it would be better said over that email and I had no idea how long it would take to reach her. I did say there was a source of the stress that I wanted to tell her during the appointment but that I did not fell comfortable saying it then, and to expect the email about it so we could discuss it during next appointment. She finally got it two days before my scheduled phone appointment on September 22nd. Here is what happened:

Right away, as soon as the conversation started she seemed perplexed about the source of the stress and it made me feel like I needed to defend myself. The questions she asked me indicated that she didn‚Äôt believe me/take it seriously/understand the stress source/problem I shared over the email. It was super invalidating and made me feel very uncomfortable. She did not get it. I understand why... the medical malpractice subject that caused the stress is a normalized thing in the medical profession even though it hurts a lot of people, it‚Äôs something hidden and not talked about a lot (but very real and there are plenty of doctors who are on the same page as me). I knew she was approaching the conversation from a view influenced by that normalization/bias and had not encountered this before. After talking about the anxiety (which I discussed with her by phone over the last appointment but not the ED because I felt uncomfortable explaining my problem over the phone and thought that I could articulate it better over email), she seemed ready to end the call and move on to the next appointment. She said absolutely nothing about the eating... not a question not word about it. I thought I did more than a lot of people with an ED would do in terms of reaching out for help about it when I felt ambivalent about seeking assistance from a doctor (I thought I could handle the eating problem by myself), yet she still didn‚Äôt seem to pick up on it. She asked me ‚Äúanything else?‚Äù (in a quick/automatic tone seeming like she thought the appointment would be over now, not that she was trying to coax an ED confession out of me).

So it really seemed like I had to spell it out for her. Did she even read the whole email?? I don‚Äôt understand how she could have missed this! I even mentioned the calorie counting, and the amount of weight I lost took me from a conventionally-‚Äúideal‚Äù BMI to a slight ways into the underweight category. To help her out a but and make it a bit more obvious. After all, maybe she was having a busy day and missed it? Maybe because of my demographic (since I‚Äôm a guy) she didn‚Äôt consider an ED right away?

I told her over the phone about the weight loss again and she just said to make sure I eat a healthy/nutritious diet. So then, as if it couldn‚Äôt be any more obvious, I told her the weight loss was intentional and that I was counting calories.
She asks ‚Äúwhy are you trying to lose weight?‚Äù. I tell her that it makes me feel good and I use it to cope with the root issue (the one I had just unsuccessfully communicated with her about), as an outlet for the obsessive thoughts and anger.

This is when she finally started to clue in, and starting questions related to the disordered eating. She did concede that it seems to be an ER, and told me to find someone in the province I go to uni in (I‚Äôm out-of-province for school, she is my PCP from my home province) for help about it, and to let her know when I do. She suggests an anti anxiety med. I ask her ‚Äúdoes that medication cause weight gain?‚Äù because thats obv what my mind thinks about and wants to know. I probably shouldn‚Äôt have asked.. it was kind of impulsive and I wanted to know.

She straight up asks me ‚Äúwhy are you so concerned about your weight?‚Äù in a perplexed voice. (?)
Made me think... do you even know how an ED works? I get that it‚Äôs not your specialty, but come on... did I not make the situation clear enough to you already? I felt so uncomfortable and embarrassed.

After the call ends, she calls me for a second time and recommends a private ED clinic in my university‚Äôs city that she just looked up. I say something like ‚Äúk thanks‚Äù briefly and I don‚Äôt say much more, this already seemed like a lost cause to me and I didn‚Äôt want to waste my time talking to her any longer.

TW:
All of a sudden, a get a third call from her a minute later. She asks in a slightly frantic/worried voice and asks me if I cut myself or if I plan to hurt myself OR OTHERS.

I was a bit shocked that she felt the need to ask that based on her conversation. I get it... if she feels a need to make sure she might feel obligated to ask just in case... but where in that conversation did I allude to self harm or even mention anything about suicide or violent intentions towards others? Nowhere. I was/am not depressed, so the self-harm and questions felt out-of-place and inappropriate. I know EDs can have an association with self-harm, but it still felt strange that out of nowhere she automatically went to that‚Äîand called me again just to ask it! That fact seemed to make it appear that she thought it was likely enough that I was a danger to myself OR OTHERS to warrant another call just to ask me that alone.

Other than the AN disordered thinking, which I told her I understood what was happening and that I‚Äôm aware of the problem, everything I said about the source of my stress and the conversation itself made complete sense. I was quite nervous and uncomfortable during the phone call, but I never expressed strong anger, instability/volatility, nor any delusions. It felt like she was looking at me as if I was completely delusional and not making sense, just based on the fact that I may have an ED. I felt so misunderstood and dismissed. Also feeling a bit insulted at the way she went about this conversation, but I didn‚Äôt take it personally.

I am otherwise healthy and I was speaking logically/making sense, I had a relatively calm demeanour for the whole time, and all of a sudden since I have anxiety and an ED now she thinks she needs to be concerned that I‚Äôm a hazard to myself and others? As if she can just dismiss everything I said about the cause of the stress (since it was inconvenient for me to recognize the stress source/problem and she probably wanted to defend the medical malpractice since she didn‚Äôt view it as that) because I‚Äôm obviously just delusional or something and she can chalk it up to that!

I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù very firmly, then I told her that this phone appointment really did not help me‚Äîin fact, the opposite‚Äîit made me more reluctant to seek help because why the hell would I wanna  sign myself to be misunderstood more and made to feel uncomfortable again? It made me want to turn around and run the other way! I already have a subconscious distrust of healthcare workers because of the medical malpractice-induced stress I‚Äôm already dealing with, so it‚Äôs extra situationally-ironic that I‚Äôm seeking help from the same institution that hurt me in the first place, which was the cause of the problem!

I felt like I had to scream that I had a disordered eating problem from the rooftops in order for her, generously giving hints and nudges. So many people go great lengths to hide it and don‚Äôt seek help. It was already uncomfortable for me enough to tell her about the eating problem since I always doubt whether it‚Äôs actually real and if I have a problem, and I felt embarrassed about it and I hadn‚Äôt shared it with anyone‚Äîyet here I am spelling it out for her multiple times. I felt that she should have picked up on it a lot sooner, and she should have been given me the impression that she had the slightest idea of how EDs worked. And the way she discounted/discredited me so quickly... even though I was making sense concerning all of the topics in the conversation (non-related to EDs, plus I made clear I was aware of the disordered thinking) and I was calm for the whole conversation.

I know she‚Äôs not a bad doctor and I don‚Äôt mean to demonize her or anything, but I really don‚Äôt think she handled that appointment well, especially her reactions and how she made me feel regarding a delicate topic that I was sensitive and felt vulnerable sharing with her about to begin with. That phone appointment left such a bad taste in my mouth. I felt so vulnerable about opening up about my problem to her, only then to be met with those reactions. I felt so uncomfortable about the idea of reaching out to her again after being so misunderstood and made to feel so uncomfortable, so I resigned from her care two days later. What good is a PCP for someone if they don‚Äôt trust them and feel too uncomfortable to ever reach out to them, even when they might need help? I intended to find a new PCP, perhaps one that would make me feel more at ease than that.

Since then I found a psychiatrist (by myself though reaching out to a doctor associated with my university‚Äôs clinic) who has been great. She took my problem about the medical malpractice stress seriously, and it felt like she totally got it. It never feels like she looks at me as if I‚Äôm not making sense or being delusional when I talk to her about it. I feel so understood. Everything she asks about the eating patterns and thoughts makes sense, and when I share the thoughts, and my thoughts about the thoughts, it feels like she gets what I mean and I don‚Äôt feel like I have to defend myself. The contrast is so refreshing compared to the PCP.

Does that experience with the primary care physician seem strange? Is it a common thing to feel like you need to spell out that you gave an ED un order for them to pick up on it? Are they usually so quick to ask if you plan to harm others‚Äîas if the fact that I‚Äôm stressed about having been hurt and the idea that I may have an ED probably makes me likely to lash out with violence even though I never stayed nor implied any intentions of the sort? Is it normal for a PCP to totally gave no grasp on the patterns of thinking involved in an ED?

Two months later I am doing a bit better now and I continue to see the psychiatrist and a counsellor. They have been good listeners and they make me feel understood!! Not just superficially, I think they ‚Äúget it‚Äù.

Thanks for reading my long, somewhat rambling story that I wrote on the spot."
