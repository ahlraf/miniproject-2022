I'm not depressed, I have so much energy and will to live. I use the threat of suicide as a means of manipulation. I'm a monster.

So many people have shown nothing but support to me, yet I destroy them. Purposefully do things that I know will cause them harm. A wolf in sheep's clothing. Holy fuck what do I do. I should kill myself, but I'm far too selfish to actually do it. I abuse everyone I have the chance to. No wonder people fucking hate me. I'm literally a piece of shit.

you came back after so many years

and it gave me a feeling of hope

that, maybe you remembered how much i loved you

and you wanted it back

but it isn't true

your happy with what you are

and i am not

i've never been since you left

when i told you all of this

it broke that growing bond 

i am so sorry

sorry for you

sorry for myself

and full of regret over every second in all these years

that i endured without you

but with you, all of this pain came back

when i had eased my mind to fade off into nothingness

you ruined it

i know there is no future
 
not for me

not for us


its all over

i cant take it anymore

its too painful to know you

cause you are not meant for me

and i am not meant for life


now the year's over and i am alone again

i told you everything but this

i am afraid to die alone -

if i only could rest my head on your lap and fade away

I'd die the way i never was being alive:

happy"
kntd9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kntd9a/should_i_kill_myself_after_graduating_college_or/,Should I kill myself after graduating college or just do it now?,2,0,1609433274.0,"I will be stuck in this country for another 4-6 years even after graduating and I am already suicidal, I think that if I do it after graduating then it would at least be a fuck you towards my parents. Honestly this is the only reason I keep going on, I have no other reason left to live. I had a crush on a guy living abroad and I thought I could be with him if I become better and after graduating, but now he is married with someone else and that was it... I dont have a single reason left to live except for this, I am just delaying the inevitable because if I do it during college or right now in the first year then it would look like it was becauss of college and that I couldnt do it, but if I do at the end of college then it would at least be a fuck you towards them because of all the money they wasted by ""investing"" in me.

I am already pressured by them to be with a woman, but at least I could blame it on the pandemic. I hate that I will never date any guy, I honestly feel unworthy of anyone, I stopped trying, right now I just wanna die, but at least screw my parents over because they are the main reason I am like this.

I know it is a petty thing to do, but in the end they already said that they wouldnt care if I commited suicide and would just bury me 3 days later and my friends never really gave a damn when a classmate commited suicide in high school so why would they if I did it?

&#x200B;

Right now nothing brings me joy, I am feeling numb all the time and I just wanna die, I only focus on studying and that's all."

It's been almost a year since I last attempted suicide (29th Jan). Since then, I just feel like it'll happen eventually. As in I will die by suicide at *some point*, whether that be now or in a few years. I've just lived day by day, feeling empty, and being shit scared of the fact I'm doing nothing. I'm 17 and not in college or school or work. I fucked up my test results at school, because of some weird thing inside me that seems to make me sabotage everything whenever it goes well. I'm just sitting here, thinking my future is most likely to live with my parents since I can't do anything for a couple years then kill myself, probably before I'm 20. I think COVID was actually a bonus to me, because it meant I had less pressure from family to get a job or go to college. If they kept up maybe I would've died this year. I can't stop thinking about how I felt when I attempted earlier this year and how happy I felt when I thought it was all going to be over. Sorry for the horrible formatting, I'm on mobile right now."

My life is living hell and anything else is better. Nothing will change anyways. Everything is only going to get worse. I have lost pretty much everything I have nothing I enjoy. This world has abused me and the last year was just too much. I'm traumatized, alone, hopeless and I feel like I'm being crushed. I've had bad times before but nothing like this.

People have never valued me for who I am. Everybody has always left me. People think I'm boring, useless and miserable. I have never in my almost 30-year long life had a long term healthy relationship. I haven't had sex with anybody in years. All of my ""friends"" have their own lives and don't have anymore time for me. Maybe they just want to get rid of me. It's nice to see how people you thought cared about you, just leave. I'm disappointed, angry and hopeless.

I have started to have sadistic fantasies. I want to revenge the world what it has done to me. I want to see others suffer like I do. Maybe they then would understand something. I hate seeing happy people. It makes me angry. It simply shows everything I'm missing and what I can't have. I'm tired of feeling this way.

And there is no place where I can get any help. I don't have money for therapy and getting any help for mental issues during COVID is next to impossible. Because I'm adult, society simply expects me to go on, do work and not feel any pain. Weakness is not allowed. But I am weak. Weak and pathetic.

This all will end. Before midnight, if anybody can't convince me otherwise, I will kill myself. I have things already planned. 

So, goodbye!"

And I can help others with my experience and be there for them.

I’ve red that a lot of you are thinking about ending it tonight. I understand that. I’m not going to tell you that everything will get better etc. You know that words. But maybe I can give you some hope with this..

They have intensified, more specifically last night. Usually when I think about suicide, I think about graphic images of me slitting my wrists or hanging myself or just stabbing myself until I bleed out. Sometimes the method I think of depends on how much energy I think I’ll have to do it if I actually decide to that day or that moment. Anyways, when I think of these things I never actually have a plan; I don’t plan out details, write suicide notes, say goodbye to anyone. I just think about it. How it would be so much easier for me to be dead than try or fix my life at the moment. I may only be 20 but I feel like I’m in my 30s and all the mistakes I’ve made or too hard to fix, especially on my own. Last night, (more like 11 pm to 3 am) I was distressed.

Me and him didn’t work out because I would tell him that I was suicidal- because he told me I could talk to him when I was feeling that way- and it was too much for him. He felt I was manipulating him by telling him I wanted to hurt myself after he would tell me he just wanted to be friends at the moment. In my defense there were times where I would call and say I felt that way for something completely different. But whenever he canceled our plans to hang out or didn’t text me back after a whole day or I just felt him pulling away from me (most likely from my mental health issues) I felt abandoned. I felt helpless and useless and worthless. Keep in mind that at this time I wasn’t on meds or getting therapy. I was also not diagnosed with BPD u til about a month later so I never knew that was an issue I had. My BPD is the main reason I felt suicidal by the little things he did. Anyways, I’ve been so attached and obsessed with having him back that I would call him to talk about it and explain my self but he was convinced that I was just manipulative and abusive. He wanted nothing to do with me. He eventually told me I would never have another chance and to stop contacting him. I did for over a month starting November 20th but ended up calling him last night. We both work at the same hospital btw. I just started working there so I haven’t seen him but it’s only about time. At this point, I’m convinced I’m crazy. Logic doesn’t exist for me. Only emotion. I keep reaching out to this guy who clearly doesn’t want shit to do with me and then I put myself through rejection every time I call. Which is exactly what happened last night. He told me to stop calling him. He also had my number blocked so I had to dial *67 first to get though to him. Like I said I’m fucking crazy. I cried all the way home and broke down when I got into my house. I started planning out suicide notes, who I was gonna say goodbye to and who I was going to give a peace of my mind for treating me bad. It was terrible. I started crying waterfalls because I feel I have zero support from my “friends” or family but I ignore the ones that have been reaching out to me lately, mostly because I feel it’s too late for me to get help anyways. I also don’t trust anyone anymore. My closest friend said she was going to visit me when I disclosed to her that I was going to hurt myself and she never did. I tried calling her these past few days and she never answered or got back to me. I’m convinced that I have no real friends. I have maybe two people that would do anything for me but they don’t live close so they could only do so much. Anyways, I keep going back and forth between wanting to die and thinking about the bad things that might happen if I do die or what I might miss out on. I’m moving into my own apartment soon and I’m thinking about working hard all next year to become a big influencer and educate people on mental health. If I die I won’t get to do any of that. Also if I try to kill myself and I fail and it’s severe I’ll have to go to a hospital (if I’m smart enough to) or someone will find me and I’ll end up in a mental hospital. Once I’m there my freedom is gone. Plus I can’t work but I’ll have to end up paying for a hospital stay (at the least 3 days if I’m voluntarily committed). I’m honestly boat sure what to do. I feel crazy. I keep forgetting to take my meds. I can’t clean my room or my body most of the time. I can’t fulfill basic responsibilities of an adult. I wish I was a child again. Idk what to do. I’m really obsessed with trying to convince this guy that I’m not manipulative but every time I talk to him he pushes me away. I have almost no logic left in me. I’m still not sure if I want to go through with my plan of slitting my wrists today..."

I graduated high school and hated everyone. But recently I got out of the hospital and they rewired my brain. My family are just fuckers and fuck with me day to day. Some of them actively want me killed but will name all of my issues to make themselves look better. I am simply holding on to normal life and holding on to my family thinking they loved me. They actually fuck with me constantly and think I'm a bum POS but can't admit it. I have no place here.

I was supposed to move out of my parents house in 3 days, and I'm gonna live with my boyfriend who lives over 6000 km away from me and in a different country. But because of the quarantine rules I'll have to wait till half january at least, and meanwhile my parents (and especially my mom) are making my life a living hell over the tiniest mistakes. Just half an hour ago my mom verbally treathened to kick me down the stairs because I was crying in my room instead of doing chores, and when I said ""why don't you do that then"" she grabbed me by the collar of my hoodie hard enough that I was scared the might choke me. I'm mainly here because I don't know what to do... it's new year's eve tonight so I'm expected to be happy and play games with the family. But I can't stop thinking about when I'm gonna leave. Anytime that is not right now seems to be too far away, I just wanna die actually, but I'm too scared to do that. I've always been taught to be grateful, so many other people would wish to have the life I have, but I just feel worthless and... I just dont wanna be here anymore. But I have nowhere to go, I'm literally forced to stay in this house until I can leave properly. It makes committing suicide seem like a very tempting way to not have to feel all this pain anymore... but I have a brother and a boyfriend who I don't want to force to go through the loss of my life. I don't know what to do anymore... does anyone have an idea how I can change my life so it becomes more do-able until I can leave?"

I dont really deserve love, if people knew how fucked up I really am 
I drove away people who cared about me with my viscous anger 
I am self-destructive and self sabotage all the time 
I dont know how much longer I can take 
the heights terrify me 
the subway slamming into me scares me 
the organ failure brutalizing me makes me shudder 
the noose strangling my neck and suffocating me makes me wince 
but life is not worth living like this 
If this is all that I am 
I don't want to get out of bed or go to work even though I have to 
I am 24 years old and I'm a fucking pathetic waste of space and I always will be

No.

It doesn't.

In all honesty, it really doesn't. 

As of right now I'm fifteen and I really don't see myself making it to adulthood, or even the age of sixteen or seventeen, for that matter. In the past two or three years, it would be a reasonable guess that I haven't gone a single day without thinking about killing myself. I can't remember anymore happy thoughts. I exist to suffer. I have no talents. My grades are slipping. I'm not going to get anywhere in my future. So why even remain on here on Earth if my existence servers no purpose?

It's getting to the point where I can't even distract myself from horrible thoughts via activity. Gaming and socializing aren't even remotely fun anymore.

I also really hate when people say suicide is selfish. No, no it isn't. They're not the ones who has to sit and suffer through every single day. They're the ones who have passions, dreams and an actual future. And they're making me suffer by continuing to let me exist. They're actually the selfish ones.

Honestly, I'm contemplating just driving off a cliff or jumping off a bridge at this point. Yeah, it's violent, but it'll get the job done, right?

Peace out."

Some days are good but most of them are bad. 

Yesterday it was so bad that I almost succeeded in committing suicide if it weren’t for my brother who went to my room to check up on me and saw me laying in the floor with both wrists  cut wide open, blood all over the carpet and me unconscious because I also took 15 pills of clonazepam so I could overdose. I JUST WANTED EVERYTHING TO STOP.

I wanted to die quickly.  I felt happy and in peace because it was going to be finally over. The noise, the pain, the chaos in my mind, my demons were gonna be silent forever.

Next thing I knew I was in a hospital, my stomach being pumped out through my nose, i was injected with an antidote for the overdose and two nurses were stichting my wrists. They said if I hadn’t arrived at that moment, my organs would have paralyzed and i would have died of a heart attack immediately. It was the worst experience in my life. Why? Because  My parents who are unemployed had to pay for the bills and i feel very guilty and hurt all over. I am on the post-attempt suicide day and i DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I just wanted to tell you guys that my parents faces where the faces of terror and shock. My brother who found me was in tears all day yesterday and today he didn’t even want to look at me. Now they want me to go to a psychiatrist that we cant afford. I just feel really bad about the money. The money my parents were going to spend was going to be for groceries and bills, and now they are left with nothing. I feel terrible."

I'm 23 years old and for all 23 years it has literally felt like not a single person on this planet understands what's going on in my brain. No one. Not a single person I've ever dated, not my friends, not my parents or any of my roommates. Sometimes I think maybe I'm just a bitch because I have uncontrollable bouts of anger over things that feel like a big deal to me, but no one else ever sees it. I'm extremely irritable and I can never relate to anyone's point of view on anything. It's like everyone's logic here just does not apply to me. And I do my best to try and understand and change my own point of view but sometimes it's so much rewiring that it becomes hard to manage.

Maybe it's just a normal thing not to see eye-to-eye with people on certain things but I don't know. This feels extreme. Like people act in ways that could just never compute to me in a million years. It's like I hate every human. and I think that every human hates me, when in reality, I'm completely irrelevant. 

It's like my brain is flipped upside down and I'm seeing everything completely different from everybody else. Does anyone else feel this way? 

I try my best to act normal but everyone looks at my thought process as if I'm an alien? I'm just one of those weird people. I can only fake it for so long, ya know? It takes too much conscious effort to not be weird. I'm just being myself and it fucking sucks because I make no sense. Ever. 

It's like no one can understand me no matter how hard I try to explain things clearly to them, even though I'm always trying to understand them. I'm not perfect. A lot of dramatic things happen before I ever actually understand someone else's POV, but still. I'm really trying.

Maybe a good example of this is how most humans think they're right all the time. But I think I'm wrong all the time. I don't have enough confidence to think I could be right when it comes to anything. 

I actually think that confidence and extreme insecurity may be a big link to this, somehow. My self esteem is so low that most people can't even fathom hating themselves to the degree that I do? And I'm not trying to say that I hate myself more than anyone else in the world, I'd definitely be dead already by now if I did. But it's gotta be pretty damn low if it literally effects the way that I interact with other people to the point that they literally cannot understand my thought process.

It's like I'm painfully self-aware but not at the same time. And I also expect everyone else to be as self aware as I am too. I'm aware of every little flaw that I have, from hypocrisy to expecting way too much from other humans, and all that.

Anyway, I'm sorry that this was so long and barely made any sense. Its 4 AM and I just can't understand why nobody can understand me? Does any part of this post make sense to anyone?"

It might not kill you immediately either. Rarely in war are there these single climactic battles that begin and end it all. It can be one battle where the losses are too high, where a side fails to recover, where the initiative is lost and the dynamic shifts.

I dont want to believe my life is ending, but it looks like it is, and honestly, why not just get it over with."

Who do people walk around interested in life when nothing matters? I’m expected to go to school and work in order to sustain myself but why? I heard a report about a government official speaking about galactic federations. There’s no way we’re the only ones here and we’re just so small and little that nothing we do ever matters. And that’s what makes it hard, not that I’m sad or I wanna die but just the fact that all our stresses and fears are stupid, not just that but  our whole existence is such a small insignificant period in an insanely large time line. We’ll be here and gone before we know anything. I can strive my whole life to my successful and happy and on the off chance I do what then? I get to have the perfect family and be comfortable with my money? We have to give up our priceless time in order to make money. Something made by us that has divided us unlike anything else. Our emotions aren’t important at all. So why am I having these shitty emotions all the time when I’m significant. It pisses me the fuck off when I think about it, and sadly, it’s all I think about. I look at myself in the mirror and I see nothing. I look at what I own and I see nothing. I try to look in the future and picture myself and I can see nothing. I’ve lost interest in anything I have ever loved. I never missed a ball game a few years ago and now I can’t sit through one without falling asleep. It’s like I have 5 options in this life, be toxic, sleep, eat, work, study. Nothing is fun anymore, nothing is worth it anymore. It just sucks that’s all."

I've been suicidal on and off most of my life. Mostly triggers and shit circumstance. Well 2020 has pretty much topped that off. I've lost 12 family members including the woman who raised me (grandmother). Found my wife cheating on me for apparently months. Found the photos, videos, text exchanges etc. Found her dude and told his wife so he could feel some pain I feel. Doubt it affected him much. I pushed as hard as I could to help my wife finish school (she did with honors) she said I didn't help her at all, and she did it all on her own. After she graduated, she emptied the house of her possessions and took our son. She filed a restraining order against me for being suicidal. It included our son. I'm all alone. I latched onto a beautiful woman for emotional support, she complained about her marriage too. I tried my best to give her advice and recommend she give him a chance as she admitted he has improved and is doing better. Through all this I think I fell in live with her. She cared more about me than my own wife. Butt she'll never leave her husband, and I don't want to be responsible for that. I won't do that to another man, not what was done to me. I filed for divorce today, it should be served at the court hearing for my restraining order. I expect the order to become permanent. I expect to lose my inheritance because of that. I'll be all alone, no heir, no heirlooms, family is nearly all dead as it is. I wanna go home, I want to be with my family and remember what love feels like. I'm one of the best liars you'll never meet. Inn public I'm successful, confident, driven.... But that's business and inside I'm hollow, torn, and lost. Fought in war, done many things, found a few friends, but they have their own lives to live. They can't provide the support I've been needing.

I did everything to make them want me and love me but nothing could change the fact that I would always love them 100x more than they ever would care for me back. I started to think I was the problem but who cares if I’m the problem? All I know is that I feel lonely and worthless and unhappy everyday. What kind of life am I living if I go on like that? Although I’m only 17 I don’t really care about the whole “you have a whole life ahead of you” bullshit as I tried to stay hopeful and find meaning in my horrible life and it didn’t work out.

My mother died, my uncle developed pancreatic cancer, my grandmother had a stroke and got hospitalized and I needed surgery, all in the same month that my new year of studies started.

&#x200B;

I stopped talking to the rest of my family, my friends and the girlfriend I once had started getting colder and colder towards me. So basically I don't have any real life connections anymore.

&#x200B;

I studied for three years straight, 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. I barely slept, barely ate and barely had free time. And even after all of this, I wasn't able to get into the college I wanted, so nothing was accomplished after all that.

&#x200B;

This entire year I have stayed inside my room, leaving only on rare ocasions. I already had social anxiety, but it's come to a point that leaving my room makes me breathless and looking at and talking to other people almost makes me pass out. I don't think I can recover anymore.

&#x200B;

Almost all of my family is dead, I pushed away all of my friends, pretty much lost my girlfriend, didn't accomplish anything in my life and I can barely look at other people right now.

I dont really feel like doing anything at all. I'll introduce myself, I'll try to do something in this post to help you get to know me and what Im going though better


My name is Blue, I am pansexual, I am nonbinary and my pronouns are They/Them. Blue is not my ""birth name"" its a name I feel comfortable in as it's a name that anybody, really can have. This is a new account I made. I've deleted my other one (u/PopExciting) because I didnt want to be there anymore, on that account. It was toxic, being on that account I believe. I've been feeling terrible. I dont know how to put these emotions in words. I can put them in colours. Black, grey, red. I can put it in numbers as well 1.5/10 switching up some days to 3/10. I feel like Im at 5%. 


I have always felt like I was at 5%, theres really never a time that I've felt 50% or more. 

Im always tired, I try to sleep. The sleep doesnt help, it feels as if Im sleeping my problems away. It feels as if Im just weak, a weak dumbass. I'm never at my best, especially since I live with my mother. Shes horrible. 

Shes a manipulative mentally abusive piece of entitled shit. I hate her. I love her but I hate her and I dont know what to do. I feel as if shes mentally draining me. But you can't pour from whats already empty, so I really dont know what she is doing. We got into an argument today. I dont wish to get into detail, but she said something about how she'll ""disconnect my phone"" and ""limit my screen usage to 3 hours"" or whatever. 

I feel trapped. 

I speak to myself. I speak to myself a lot. It... It sort of bothers me. I cant control it and every move I make I feel the need to speak to myself. I never do it in public. I dont have any urges to do it in public. Only when Im alone. In my room, doing my own thing for once.

I've been suicidal. I dont self harm, I've gotten close to doing it but I didnt. 
I got out of the shower today. I took my embroidery kit, I opened it. I took my mini scissor string cutter thing out.

I contemplated what I should do with it.

Should I stab or cut my thigh? Maybe stab it in a way that it'll hit a vein or something and I'll bleed out? Nope, too painful

Should I slit my wrists and bleed out? Nope, too painful

Should I stab myself in the neck with it and watch the blood leak out of me? Nope, too painful.

I seriously thought it was too painful, that killing myself, right there and then was ""too painful"" like I gave a fuck. Im already in so much pain, I might as well cause myself some more pain, it'll be temporarily and it'll solve my problem.

Nobody understands me, they dont hear me, Im calling out for help but nobody hears me, they ignore me....

(Edit: next day)
My eyes, the next morning. Swollen from crying the night before. I cant take it anymore. I dont plan on living until 2022.
I dont enjoy the things I used to. Drawing, crafts. The only thing I use to cope is videogames.

She ruined those for me.

Im sorry..."

It doesn't help my position is unique to the office I work at. No one even understands what I do. I'm an alien to them. All the people who do I what I do work at a cooler office across the country for some odd fucking reason. Even worse, I just find it so difficult to talk about my personal life so I'm often very quiet. Everyone seems to love talking about the amazing things they are doing. What can I talk about? I'm a pathetic loser who literally does nothing but take care of his elderly mother. When people ask me how I'm doing my only literal answer is ""Fine."" Anything else, and I'd be fired and in a psyche ward.

I bought a handgun a while back specifically to end my life. I picked the largest caliber I could find... a 1911 45 ACP. I've put it to my head countless times certain I'll finally pull the trigger. Yet, I can never seem to pull it. Don't get me wrong, it isn't because I don't want to die. I most certainly do. It's just the fear of failure. Whenever the cold steel is pressed against my head I begin to think... what if it doesn't kill me? Will I end up too injured to finish the job? What if I'm so fucked up I just have to live decades in some fucked up half alive state?

I no longer care anymore. It's going to happen. I've taken Xanax tonight and I'm beginning to drink heavily. The hope is this will settle my nerves to get my brain to shut the fuck up for once.

It just sucks man. All I need is a couple close friends. Day after day not interacting with a single person outside of work is literally maddening. All I do is think. We are clearly not wired to be so alone and yet here I am. Alone."

I’ve had to watch the few I’m closest to suffer with horrible diseases and my “friends” are non existent, I mean they are only around for good times. No one talks to me unless they need something. I’m alone in this shithole of life with no hope of improving. No one calls or texts back when I reach out, I’ve begged everyone in my life to show some care or inclination that I matter to them but they just go off on tangents about how they are upset over minuscule things. I’m the least important in everyone’s lives and can’t take it anymore. I just want out. Suicide doesn’t seem as scary when no one will miss you.

I am in constant pain. None, NONE, of the help I've been offered has helped me in any way, shape or form.

I'm 15 (16 in two months) and transgender (was gay before I figured out I wanted to live as a woman). My classmates are homophobic as shit, the waiting times to receive any kind of gender affirming healthcare in this country are soooooo long. I have to wait for up to 4 years to receive any medication that'd help me, and even if it wasn't, I won't get it anyway. The dysphoria clinics here can cancel the investigation at any time and for any reason - they've told me time and time again that I won't get on hormones if I'm this depressed.

I want to be forgotten forever, I want no funeral to be held. I want to perish and to never be thought of again. I wish nothing but to die. Killing myself would be so liberating. Not having to deal with this awful place would be so so amazing.

I've a plan, and I will carry it out. I've heard survivors speak of instant regret, but I don't care. I know I'll still have suicidal thoughts if I still survive. I just want to get this over with. I've no reason to stay. Take care."

I stopped putting effort in school and my grades dropped as a result, as expected. At the beginning of the year I thought we'd all die from rona by the end of the year which was just a joke but I started thinking more about it and then I became sad like rly sad. And then my mom started being unnecessarily angry and mean and I just assumed that it was bc of her job and the fact that she was looking for a new one but I think it might be some kind of internalized anger that she's taking out on me and my siblings but especially me. She doesn't hit us or anything (well sometimes she does but it's usually like for a valid reason and not like meaningless abuse) but she verbally abused us, constantly. Like at least once or twice I would hear her complain about all she has to do while we just watch TV all day and it's just like, then tell us what to do ;-; 

That went on for a few weeks and then it went from all of us to only me bc in addition to my failing grades my room was always dirty and I almost never showered or brushed so everyday she'd yell at me to clean up and shower then point out everything I didn't do that day (like chores and stuff). Idk if she did it to make me feel useless but if she did it worked. That just made me feel more depressed and I started getting suicidal thoughts and I started planning how and when I was gonna do it. At first I wanted to jump off a building bc it always looked pretty in animes where they jump off buildings but then I realized that it probably ends faster than it looks so I decided to hang but I didn't have any rope so I would spend so much time trying to figure out how to get rope. Would I make my parents buy it and lie ab the reason? Or just buy it myself with stolen money or something bc I don't get allowance (I'm 14) so I just gave up and stuck to fantasizing about ending it while wearing a pretty dress or something

One time something rly weird happened, I just stood on the middle of my room spaced out, thinking about the day I buy a rope and go. If it's okay for me to I'll lay out the scenario: I'm checking out at Walmart with a rope in my hand, I make eye contact with the cashier and whisper ""it's my last day here."" The cashier, looks at me blankly bit then realizes what I mean and then gasps in shock, but can't say anything bc I hold a finger to my lips so the people beside me don't hear. Then I walk out of the Walmart- that's when  I snapped out of it and realized just wtf I was thinking about. It felt so real I thought it was actually happening. I probably dissociated or something bc it just felt so real I was so scared when I came back to my senses

While I was thinking ab jumping off a building I told my mom that I was gonna find the tallest building in Texas and jump off it and then she said ""then you're going to hell"" I was shocked and tbh I don't know what I expected her to say but it was definitely not that 😀 then I went down to the kitchen and got a knife out and sat on the floor, trying to decide whether to cut or not. I was to pussy to do it atm so I didn't and I just shed a single tear. I wanted to cry very hard but I wasn't very familiar with my emotions then. I've started doing more than a single tear but I still feel a bit weird about it. I told my best friend about it and she said she was there for me whenever I needed it and I wanted to cry. She's so great and I was happy she didn't just brush it off but I couldn't tell her anything bc I was scared that she might stop talking to me because she wouldn't want to be friends with a mentally unstable person. I'm afraid of losing her she's my only friend and I think I might like her but I'm probably just attached (either way I'm gonna end up lonely asf) After that it's not like I got any better, school became a burden and I got more depressed to the point that my mom, who was basically the cause of it, noticed that something was def not right. On multiple occasions she asked me what's wrong and told me to tell her anything that's bothering me. I said in my head ""if only you knew it was you"" and that made me even more depressed bc I had no one to talk to. Then I came on Reddit and found this sub and others and even though I didn't ask for help or anything it was kinda nice to know that I wasn't the only suicidal person in the world. Yet somehow that only made me feel worse bc there are so many people in a worse situation than me. People are getting brutally abused and have so much trauma while my pathetic ass is sad bc I don't like online school, my mom points out that I don't do anything around the house(which is a fact but it's not deliberate, idk how to explain it) and that I'm a stupid closeted bi girl that doesn't know if she'll ever find love 😐 I try talking people out of suicide but I can't say shit like ""it's worth staying alive"" bc I don't believe that's true and I feel the exact opposite and I'm not very good at faking, I'm not the kind of ""smile through the pain"" girl so just don't say anything when people post on here that they can't take it anymore and they're gonna end it. Which is, unironically, another reason to be even more depressed.

Last week I started showing symptoms of covid and I wasn't exactly sad but I was at the same time. Not sad that I was probably gonna die alone but that I didn't get to do stuff on my bucket list like go to Japan, wear lolita dresses and have a tea party with my bsf, have kids and raise them to be super mega weebs(ik it's weird but I like the idea), etc but the day after I started showing symptoms and crying about it, my mom came to wake me up and I started crying and saying ""I'm tired, I'm so tired"" and I meant I was too tired to be up at 8 am bc I slept late the day before and I wasn't ready to start my day and I just didn't want to get up but then my mom started talking asking me if it's because of my grades and school and my whole 2 month long depressive state and then I thought ""oh yeah that too"" then after that whole thing, for two more days she started acting like we're best friends and my dad started acting unusually nice to me, he was abusive last year and he's not anymore but it's not like he normally cares about me, his favorite is my little brother so he doesn't really act like he cares about anyone so it was very weird when he started asking me if I'd eaten and he was calling me stuff like ""Ada"" in Igbo culture the first daughter is the ""Ada"" and they usually get called that as a form of praise or like a pet name  so I was very weirded out by this. Now that I think about it my mom probably told him about my whole crying thing and told him to be nice to me but idk.

It's been a week and I'm not showing covid symptoms anymore, I just have a cold but they haven't stopped treating me like that and it's so weird since I thought they were only doing it because I was sick and I just want them to go back to normal because this might sound stupid but I want to feel depressed again. I wrote a fake suicide note and got a razor and stuff to use to treat cuts but I didn't actually do anything because I have a fear of blood and I don't like to feel pain which is stupid for a suicidal person 😍   it's probably something in me that's happy that they're being nice to me but I don't like it I want to go back to normal I don't mean ""being suicidal is cool, depression is swaggy"" but I just don't know how to explain it I want to feel that way again idk please let me know if I'm just being stupid or I just can't accept that my parents actually care about me actually now that I just read that that's probably what it is lmao on Sunday I said something rude to my mom and she didn't get offended and I told her ""why aren't you offended ;-; you're supposed to be offended"" and she wasn't and I was so confused

I think there's like side effects of being like that for two months tho, I'm more comfortable with a dirty room than I am with a clean one, I can't sleep with my closet doors closed bc the idea of someone watching me is weirdly creepy but comforting?? Idk and I can go at least a week without showering and brushing unless 

Can someone just tell me what to do ;-;

TLDR: I was depressed, suicidal but I'm not anymore and I want to be depressed again"

Sometimes ill just be at work and have a subtle passing thought about it. It feels constant and the worst realization ive ever had in counseling was that even if all of my dreams came true tomorrow it still wouldn't be worth everything that I've dealt with. Its so hard to have any hope. All I want is love but im not interested in getting to know anyone anymore its not fun it's exhausting. I have absolutely no capability of trusting someone to be loyal to be and I always self sabotage, i don't know how to stop or push these feelings away. I want to die I can't even attempt to risk another attempt at love the thing I want the most because I can't handle it the looming heartbreak, and it's not that I'd rather be alone. What is the point in living if you know you will never have the one thing you want most in life. Im so tired I've tried so hard to improve myself and improve my mental health but I truly believe I am beyond repair and it breaks my heart that I can't even love myself enough to want to be alive."

She ruins holidays and makes life very stressful. I lost my pet this year and she wanted to throw away his things right away. Everyone else is far away and I wasn't comfortable talking to friends or family about deep problems, part of it that my family always just told me to turn to religion. I'm not religious. I did make a memorial for him but someone threw it away like trash. I finally tell my friends and only one gives a care. No one else does. I've been making plans to escape my narc mom but it's been really stressful. All this stress has been building and building and building. Sometimes it's hard to just get up and walk.Today she stressed me out then mocked me because I was having an anxiety attack, or maybe panic. Then she yelled at me. I try, I try so hard every day. I just want to lay down and rot. I don't know if it's worth it anymore."

okay I’m 15 and guy and I realised that I’m stupid af and that my reason to exist in this world has been going lower and lower.

Everything started in the summer of started 8th grade , I started to masturbate, but at the time I had no idea what that was at all. and to make it worse I'm part of a Muslim family, and masturbation is completely I haram(illegal).

\*I started before I could even ejaculate\*

I felt bad doing it but I didn’t care for some reason (cause I’m stupid) and I continued to do it until it began to become an addiction.  I knew what porn was when I found a video on Youtube of someone masturbating, I knew looking at women was completely bad and in Islam we are told to lower our gaze from the opposite gender. but I didn’t think it meant with the same gender as well, so I started to jack off to gay porn as well.

so the same loop for 3 years of me trying not to masturbate but I am a failure and continued to masturbate and watch porn and I hit puberty so I started to ejaculate.

now that I do this often, I’m starting to look at the male teachers in my high school. idk why older people seem to turn me on and younger people completely turn me off. and I know this is all bad 

but I’m fucking stupid and I try not to do it but I still do

(I’m saying I want to stop but do I really want 2)

when I turned 15 it got a whole lot worse, I found websites where you can talk to other adult males but I went in as my age and obviously the perverted people started talking to me and grooming etc and I went with it since I was turned on. so I started to cam with other guys while we jacked off and older 35+ old men watched me jerk off on cam and enjoyed it as well and I was enjoying it 2

but when I came I felt like dying cause I’m so fucking perverted and I’m legit ruining my life and asking to be on Pornhub (people record this stuff and put it on Pornhub) and plus I don’t want to be gay at all. I’m fine with other people being gay and stuff like that, like live your own life but don’t hurt yourself or other people. but I don’t want to be gay at all I only prefer to be straight

eventually I started playing a game and I found some guy and we chatted normally, it was all innocent then I wanted to confess that I’m a perverted idiot to this guy to relieve myself and try to forgive myself for being an idiot but it turns out the guy was bi and then I started sexting him and he was reluctant since he knew I was 15 and he was like 23 or something (all on discord)

\*context for next part\* ( me and my sibling get along really well, we tell each other our problems and play video games together and we tell each other the things we are guilty of I really love my family and my sibling knows about my addiction but not the porn part also they are all older then me)

my sibling knows the password to my laptop and she found my discord and went through it. then she found the guy I was talking to and she was about to read it before I came into the room and saw it then turned off the screen trying to dodge what I was saying, she was confused and asked what did I say to this person, I said it didn’t really matter but she insisted and I came somewhat clean and said I’m talking to a guy about my masturbation problem and she did not take it well since I said I was sexting him basically and she broke I love her a lot since she’s my sibling but I guess her hearing what I said must of been devastating since she knows me as a guy who hates sexual desire and stuff since I go on about how sexual desire is the reason we are the worse species to exist,

\* I also tell her I hate sex and that I never want to have it in my life\*

and she had suicidal thoughts already but this sort of set her over the edge and she cut herself when she told me I broke as well and started crying telling her to forgive me and she did but I still think she is lying 

now I’m here, I’m ruining other peoples lives and my own

so great isn’t it what should I do I’ve cutted myself for my stupid decisions and I need help now since its only a matter of time before I rape someone

ALSO don’t give me shit about how masturbation is healthy for my age because I don’t want to hear it and don’t blame my sibling at all cause you people don’t know the entire story since I cant really spill my 15 years of life."

knhwki,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/knhwki/im_about_to_commit_suicide/,I'm about to commit suicide,3,0,1609385482.0,"I'm from 3rd world country which has a lot of problems these days not just cause of the coronavirus, but I have been born in one of the richest Gulf countries *\[ps. as a foreigner, I don't have any rights so it's like living as a 3rd world country dude but you have a better view of the rich world you can't join them but you can watch them\].*

My life start to get \*\*\*\* when I turned 11 years old my mom started a business and she was making a good amount of money but for no reason, she got deported *\[they said that she can't stay here anymore because she got divorced and the funny part my parents divorced when I was 7 so after 4 \*\*\*\* years they diced to deport her\]*

after my mom got deported I stayed with my older aunt for 6 months and my mom got a visa to another gulf country and then I traveled to her at age 12.

after I went to ""the new gulf country"" my mom couldn't afford private school for me so I waited for 3 years so we can find someone to give us (favoritism) and yes this is how it works there because as I said before as a *foreigner* you don't have rights.

when I turned 13 I didn't have much to do because I wasn't in school so I was hanging out with my youngest aunt \[she was 17 years older than me\] so I stayed with her because her husband spent all his time with his first wife \[yeah she is his second wife\].

after a few weeks, she started to kiss me (in a sexual way) and after a couple of days from that we were having full Sexual intercourse yeah that is sexual assault but the problem is I still can't say she sexual assaulted me because I enjoy it at that time at least and then this thing starts to be a routine thing 3 - 4 times a week for 6 years.

when I turned 19 I was in my second year in high school we start having problems again my mom lost her savings and her job and she tried to get my aunt's help but my aunt at that time just got divorced and found a new man and just ignored everyone.

after a few months of that, I decided to confess to my mother about what happened between me and my aunt, and she got more depressed and told what I told her to her best friend and after that, her friend came to me and start to asking me about details and said that she will help me because my aunt can easily report this as rape case or false accuse against me because I don't have any proof about what happen in the past and I'm not minor anymore and I'm a \*\*\*\*\*\* foreigner.

so she \[my mom best friend\] start asking me to call my aunt and sex texting her and talking to her about what was happening and that we need to bring back the old day etc, and my mom best friend was recording me at that time as proof for my story, and then my mother friend stated to asking me weird questions like what she like in bed? how long the intercourse last? after a couple of days of that, she asked me if I could sleep with her as an exchange for her help and I refused, then after a while, she argued with my mother so she sends the voice records to my aunt and at that moment my aunt cut all the connections with me and she called my mom to see if she know anything but my mom acted like she doesn't know anything.

so in that time, I told my mother that I will go to my home country \[I regret that I asked for that \] because I couldn't get a job unless I change my id and if I changed it I would drop high school and without any qualifications, I won't find a job.

so going to my home country was to me at that time a reasonable idea, but everything went \*\*\*\*, first, I went to my father family house in my home country and they thought I will have loads of money and after they know I don't have anything we had a big fight so my mother starts to send me some cash for rent and school and when I register to my last high school year I had to finish the curriculum in only 2 months because I was late so I barely passed my marks was \*\*\*\* and I barely finished high school after being one of the top students in my past school, after that my mother couldn't send me any money and with my high school degree the best salary I could get is 30$ a month and that is not enough even for food nor rent and with my marks, I can't go to college in my country.

so I called my father and I asked him to find me a visa so I can find a job in a gulf country and after a few months he sends me a family visit visa and the Residence procedures took a whole year and after I got my id Covid hits and lot of people lost their job and I couldn't find any job and my father is barely paying his rent and put food in the table, and the tragedy is he is in his retirement age with no saving so if he got deported for his age he will not survive.

I feel trapped and I feel like I'm in the middle of nowhere with no equipment to survive and I'm walking for infinity and can't find the way I can't go to colleges because I don't have the money and I can't find a job and even if I find a job I will barely live my life is \*\*\*\* I tried to suicide 2 times before but even in that I failed and I feel I need to do it the only thing I don't want to do is make my death more miserable then my life.

I wake up every day with a short breath I feel like I'm choking all the time I can't even afford to go to a therapist.

I just want to end everything"

My brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and I’m worried what it means about me and my life and whether or not I'm as good as other people or worthy enough to be alive. In a moment of stupidity I shut the door and encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didn’t last long a 30 seconds, maybe I don’t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second that’s that was ok or even an option mortifies me. I am terrified it makes me a monster akin to people who abuse and molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent, it makes me feel as though I don’t deserve to live and suicide constantly rattled around my head as my only release.

I hate that I ruined my life story. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I cant have any self esteem or positive image of myself.

In all other regards i was a normal teen. Other than being anxious and a little depressed. its just this weird thing i did which is horrible. I wish with all my being I could take it back I really do. I worry that I’ll never find love because I feel I don’t deserve it, and I worry I will never be able to enjoy sex because any time I do anything enjoyable that is related to sex by myself or with a partner I am reminded of my worst action it plays constantly in my head and ruins everything.

I feel so guilty and ashamed. I just want to end it all. EVERYTHING REMINDS ME OF IT and reminds me i am an awful person compared to the rest of humanity.

I need to know how horrible I am compared to the rest of humanity. I want to know how horrible, awful or disgusting what I did was. Will God or the universe ever forgive me. I just feel trapped in a horror story of my own making . Every second it feels like my skin is on fire and I just want to die.

I should start by saying that I'm not looking for a pep talk or a recommendation on a therapist.  I am looking to remove a thought in my head.  On more than one occasion, I've thought of ending it all.  I have no intention of doing this, but it's there WAY too often.  I think it may stem from my station in life.  


All of my friends are married with children.  I try not to live by comparison, but my last serious relationship was half a lifetime ago.  The last time I got laid via normal dating I was ten years ago.  When I was younger, it wasn't this difficult.  Now, I'm socially disabled.  I'm not even dating these days.  It got so bad that about 8 years ago that I gave up on trying to date.  One can get rejected or ghosted so many times in a row, right?  About 6 years ago, I started seeing ""pros.""  I feel like it was at this point my self esteem went right in the gutter.  Paying for it makes me feel like garbage when I just need some kind of companionship.  Even the pros are sometimes treating me like crap.  I'm treated like I'm an inconvenience to them sometimes.  I understand to an extent.  It's their profession and I'm just another buck.  


I don't make as much money as I'd like to, but I make ok money.  I'm behind on my retirement funds and I worry about it sometimes.  I won't give numbers or ranges.  It's not the pros as I don't see them often.  I figure I'd be back on track if I overcommitted for three or four years.  I'm trying my best, but it feels like I'm never going to get ahead.  I don't own a home, but that may change in 2021.  I drive a twenty year old beater.  It'll eventually fail on me.  I need to get ahead and I just don't know the right approach to that.  It bothers me.  


My health has gotten bad.  I've gained about 100lbs.  I take tons of depression naps when I can because it's a good escape.  I don't dream much anymore.  However, recently, I've had those bad thoughts creep into the few dreams I have.  How I'd do it.  Where I'd do it.  How satisfying it might be not to have to feel anxious or depressed so often.  Part of this is probably pandemic related, because I don't go anywhere I don't have to go for the most part.  


Does anyone have any tips/techniques on getting these thoughts out of my head?  I want it to stop as soon as possible.  I can't see a therapist.  Just know that I can't and trust me on that.  I also can't take meds either.  I think a little more exercise may help with some things (anxiety/depression).  I just want a satisfying life and not one of a loser."

Anyway, I have quite a few good things in my life, including good friends and a loving family, but if you ask me what dreams truly get me up in the morning with the will to live, there are two (albeit corny) answers: pursuing a career in writing, and the idea of falling in love with the girl of my dreams.

In High School I decided I was going to make at least one of those two dreams come true, so I earned a writing degree and started posting my work online.  It was...marginally successful.  In the years since I graduated I've averaged a little under $10,000 a year between my own projects and freelance projects.  Then the pandemic hit, and my income completely fizzled out.  Now I haven't been hired since June and am living with my parents to make ends meet.  I was already getting fatigued marching forward on so little income, now I'm wondering what the heck will even be left after this whole pandemic subsides.  I made the decision a month ago to start applying for a regular old 9-5 job, but it feels like it's crushing me.  It's not that I dislike the jobs I'm applying for, it's just that this dream has been the one thing giving me purpose, the thing I've worked 80 hours a week for and poured my soul into, and it's hard to imagine relegating it to a side project I may or may not have time or energy for anymore depending on what day job I land.

Unfortunately, the love side has been even less successful.  Dating with social anxiety is hard, dating while gay with social anxiety is harder, dating while gay with social anxiety while also trying to explain that you're not financially stable right now is even harder than that.  Needless to say I still haven't found that dream girl and probably won't for a while.

I know my dreams are a bit childish, and I feel guilty that having a loving family and the essentials of life don't feel like enough, but the reality is I feel like I'm barely functioning right now.  I'm trying to move forward imagining a new life that may not have either of those things I wanted.  However, it quickly starts to feel like the life I always feared: waking up in the morning to go to a job I'm lukewarm about only to come home, slog around my apartment alone, and then go to bed so I can do it all over again the next day.  I need a new meaning, one that's actually in my control, but I'm being sucked down into the abyss with this much faster than I can handle."

I believe everyone has a void but mine is devouring me. It begs to be seen and answered to. It begs to be fed but it doesn’t tell me what it hungers for.

I helplessly feed the void whatever I can, hoping to quench its hunger for a little while but it continues to eat away at me. 

I can’t figure out what is missing. There is so much that is missing but what is causing my void to force me to attend to it?

Is it a lack of passion? The lack of meaning in my life? Is it my avoidance of pain? Is it my resistance to leaving the comfort zone? Is it my allowing this free spirit to be trapped? Is it unhealed trauma begging to be faced and healed? Etc.

There are so many things it could be. So many unanswered questions.

I’m too aware of the meaninglessness of it all, of my own pain, my own existence, of everything, to bother delving into this and seeking answers that would take a lot of time, energy, and pain to acquire.

Although, I’m in pain regardless. My mind and my gut are constantly at war with me. Whoever the me is, since I question why I take ownership of these thoughts and feelings. 

To exist in this chaotic mind is pain. It is hell. I want to turn it off. 

I don’t have the strength to fight this mind, this gut, and this void for much longer.

That trio is winning and I come closer and closer to making my exit from this meaningless existence.

I’m usually quite passive about that but I’m getting restless. This torture is becoming too much. 

It’s all too much.

I don’t fight back. I just do my best to turn it all off. 

Not much turns this mind off, nor this gut and this void, anymore.

   sleeping pills are useless, i failed 4 attempts. i saw a really cool documentary about spies and the tools they used and was sort of inspired to buy some cyanide. though, im doubting its really cyanide. my god i wish euthanasia was legal.

   do i think suicide is selfish? - it doesnt matter, it really doesnt. yes, it is selfish, but after being called narcissistic, selfish - it doesnt matter. just another selfish thing you will do. 

   i feel like a misfit. everywhere. among my friends, among depressed people, among lgbt people. how come i dont want to feel better, to seek help? if i had one wish - i wouldnt pick become happy, i would wish i never existed : everyone would forget me and even the invisible people that would be devastated by my death. i doubt im a part of lgbt, i just seem to be an attention seeker or atleast just a late bloomer.

   i wish i was smarter, kinder, more understanding, though my asshole-self really keeps people away, but there are always some people who get through and i dont want to be rude - i want to help, hug, appreciate. ive met so many intelligent and knowledgeable people and i really enjoy talking to them, though i believe they dont really enjoy talking to ""failing school and having Fs all over the paper"".

   i look up to independent, strong-willed, brave people. and i dont mean the ""hero"" type. the ones that fight every battle themselves and try to not involve other people. they resist the need of help. deep down they wish someone would help and let out a few screams for help, yet nobody notices. they dont complain about anything and just seem nicer. they may seem cold, but are the warmest people in the world.

   fighting for your own country is suicide, yet its considered brave.
  
   i feel emotionless - no panic attacks, no sadness, no happiness. the time when earth was creating itself - acid rain, eruptions, meteors. just chaos, though it seems like im all alone in space, slowly flying away from earth. an astronaut stranded in space.

   this is a rational choice, ill probably write a suicide note after a nap, since its 1.54 am. im an insomniac, but i feel a little lazy and might go out without a suicide note or a goodbye."

At the beginning of the year things were going great. I was just brought on as a research student and offered a Census job, my boyfriend's record was expunged and he was lined up for a promotion at his job, and we had taken a wonderful trip abroad. That feels like a decade ago.

When we went into lockdown, my bf's job (a recent tech start-up) went to WFM but the company folded by June. My Census job was supposed to start in May, but I kept getting called that it was being delayed as they ""worked out some details."" Neither of us qualified for unemployment, but we had savings. We were also fed up with our elderly landlord at the time after he had another bout of forgetfulness/rage, so we rushed to find a new place. We live in a high COL area and are limited due to where my university is, but we found a place.

The new apartment was not in good shape when we got there. The landlord hadn't cleaned or done any repairs that he said he would. Yes, I know we should have gotten it in writing. We had to stay an extra month at the old place as we spent ~$1,000 to fix up the new one. Around this time I noticed my bf was acting odd. Tired, forgetful, *different*.

In the month of August alone, the following happened:

* My stalker resumed harassing me and my boyfriend. Five years ago they made it their life's mission to ensure I am never happy again. They tried to break us up again by using fake facebook accounts and fake screenshots of conversations to antagonize my boyfriend into breaking up with me.

* My boyfriend relapsed. He was a heroin addict from 19-25, but had been clean for 4 years when we met. We've been together for 3 years, so that was 7 years in recovery. The night I confronted him about it, he said he'd throw it all out but instead did it all and he overdosed. I brought him to the hospital, they narcan'd him, and he started methadone.

* We moved apartments. The new place wasn't completely ready, but what was left was cosmetic. I had done 80% of the work fixing up the new place, and knew that I could work on the cosmetic issues bit by bit.

* My bf got a job as a delivery person. Finally work! Except he's exhausted all the time.

* I started fall term, my first time back as a full-time student since I first tried to go to university out of high school. 18 credits.

* My professor makes me lead author on our research. I was flattered, excited, and mostly nervous.
 
* I started as an enumerator. What was supposed to be a summer gig that would pay the bills and provide some cash for the fall term, turned into a bust. Due to moving and my school schedule, I worked a total of 30 hours at that job, when I expected much much more. 

* I began having flashbacks to an abusive ex. The event happened 6 years ago, when he kept me isolated for a month as he sexually abused me. One night he tried to kill me, and I managed to escape. I did out-patient therapy for 3 months immediately after, but that was it.

Somehow I made it through, using my life-long trusty skills of dissociation and suppressing emotions. I even got a 4.0 this semester, an absolute shock to myself! My boyfriend works 60 hours a week so on top of my school/research work I do all the cooking, errands, chores (except trash, that's his 1 job), and taking care of our sick cat. No time for friends, who know the basics of what has been going on, but not the details.

As for my family? Well that's a different nightmare:

* My father is a narcissist. He's also a rabid Trump supporter and follower of extreme right-wing propaganda. Oh, and he's an alcoholic. 

* My mother finally decided to pursue a divorce in October. She told him that she needs space and wants to move out for a year. My dad actually seemed like he was working to make things better, until....

* My half-sister (mother's daughter) accused my father of 2 instances of sexual assault when she was 10/11. She did this via email that she sent to the immediate family. She's in her late 30s and has a family of her own. My sister and I have never been close because of the 10 year age difference, the fact that my father treated me as the golden child, and she has the complete opposite personality of me.

Yes, I'm seeing a therapist. I started in the summer when things started to get intense. I just feel like there's no hope. I'm financially dependent on my boyfriend, and I'm scared to leave him. He's still using even though he's on 120 mg/day methadone. I get worried every time he goes quiet in his office, or when he's home alone. I keep thinking I'll come home to find that he overdosed, but I wasn't there. We have narcan in the house but it's just us. Or worse, he won't come home because he nodded out when driving and crashed. I can't go live with my parents because the atmosphere at their house is incredibly toxic. They're also selling it in the spring and will be moving into 1 bedroom apartments. 

I feel so trapped.

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend relapsed after 7 years in recovery, overdosed, and now he's on methadone but still uses daily. My mother is separating from my narcissist father. My half-sister (mother's daughter) accused my father of sexually abusing her twice when she was 10/11. I am overwhelmed."

I should have died. My cousin did die for the same thing I did a couple of years after I attempted the same thing, but I survived. I feel like life now is a cruel punishment. 

The problem is I don’t even know how to explain this feeling. I just feel depressed. My anti-depressants make me feel a million times better but sometimes, like now, I feel like I just can’t take it. 

Ive just spent the last hour trying to explain how I feel but it just made me angry, because I can’t explain it. 

Part of me wants to love everything life gives me; go explore the world and meet new people, listen to new beautiful music and see things I never dreamt about. 

But tonight I feel like nothing matters. I’d hate to lose this feeling I get from listening to these tracks that make my brain happy, but at the same time I feel like an ending would stop this oppressive feeling of emptiness and self-hatred."

knbxqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/knbxqr/i_was_so_ready/,I was so ready,8,7,1609365816.0," So. I booked a hotel room and I intended to end my life on New Year's Eve, which is... today, where I live. I had intended to do it right about now actually.

I have not even felt that bad in the last week leading up to this day but I kept telling myself it's going to get worse anyway, so I should just stick to my plan and end the pain once and for all. There's a certain pattern in these depressive cycles and I know that every time I manage to come out the other side of it, it keeps coming back. It always does.

I have been feeling this way for years. So I really don't think it's going to get better. There are okay days, bad days, then *very bad* days, and on these very bad days I always regret not going through with any prior plan I had to end my life.

I had been feeling so bad the entire of December. I still don't feel great, but not bad enough to want to end myself right now. It's funny how I spent the week before this writing out my final note, and another letter to my best friend on the things I would need her help in to wrap up loose ends, with all of my passwords, bank details etc. I cleared out some of my things at work. I thought I was so ready to go. But then the last few days I suddenly felt like damn, there are still some things I would like to stick around for. Shows coming out in 2021 I want to watch, albums coming out that I still want to listen to. I haven't even managed to clean my room yet.

Maybe it's not time to go?

So now, here I am alone in the hotel room at 5am. Feeling okay, for the most part. I think I'm going to live again, this time. Even though I also know I'm going to regret it again the next time I feel super bad. I don't really know what to do about this. Does it ever stop hurting? When will it stop? I want to know that this is going to be worth it. I want so bad to win this, but what is there even to win?

I am so tired."
knbw64,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/knbw64/why_is_self_harm_bad/,Why is self harm bad?,17,7,1609365687.0,"Like, i usually harm myself to stop myself from doing anything worse, like suicide. I sterilize my skin before and after doing it, so there isn't high chance of infection, too. On top of that, I am already clumsy and hurt myself unintentionally, what does even change if i do it intentionally? Since i ran out of antidepressants, it's the only thing stopping me from suicide. I just wanna know why it's bad, can any one who knows about this explain? It would be appriciated.

Also, don't worry, i have a therapist appointment soon, and i'll probably get antidepressants or any other medications(if she gives me any). I'm just curious, and i'll ask my therapist about it, too.

Edit: Just got meds! They usually stop me from cutting so yay for me :D"

But maybe I'm wrong. So just in case... I just wanted a family of my own. I've been accepted into three amazing families in my life, the ######s the ######s and the ######s. But all of my connections to those families stopped loving me along the way. Both were very clearly my fault, I see that it's in my nature now. Maybe I'll figure out why I want to ruin love once I've had it for a while, maybe I wont. Two of these people ended it in a way that is never acceptable and the other is trying to hang on out of obligation not love anymore. I can see it in their eyes. I have friends, but none of them would ever come to me with their problems so how can I bother them with mine. I know there are people that love me. I know my family loves me unconditionally but again, I've done something that makes no one need or want me around. I am a burden to love I make it impossibly difficult somehow. I dont know where the disconnect is, I love these people and would do anything for them, even the ones that have wronged me even if I know they shouldnt be in my life anymore. I would drop everything to help any one of them. But no one wants my help lmao. I work hard at my job, I get ignored there too. I thought I had a good friend or two there but as soon as work is over I dont exist. Theres even someone I take care of daily, and I think she loves me, but because shes young and shes got others that love her it wouldn't matter if I was there for her either. People say you make your family, related or otherwise. But what is family when none of them would have their lives altered if you were to disappear. Outside of some emotional turmoil temporarily. I dont know what I'm doing wrong and no one has a good answer no matter who I've asked. And the one who matters the most to me cant or wont talk to me about how to make it better."

There is a long mental health background, a lot of different meds, a lot of different therapists, and many clinical stays. I understand my condition. I understand that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and for the longest of times, I have been the patient that said that I want to live and become better and truly meant it. 2020 has been incredibly hard on everybody, so I feel bad for saying I feel like it was the last push for me, when so many people didn't get to decide their fate. I had three hospital stays this year, each one shorter because they just kept me the mandatory 72h before leaving me on my own again. My parents are useless. Many therapists have evaluated them as emotionally unavailable and unfit to support me in my illness. My therapists and teacher have tried getting me out of there for all of 2020 and in the end, it was me who collapsed under the pressure and gave in. I am still at home, my parents still act as if I am a healthy person and don't even see that I get worse with every passing day. My teacher has been the one regularly checking in on me, making sure I don't completely suffocate at home. I am scared of myself. I have always held on for somebody else, mostly my teacher, who had lost three students previously to suicide and was hit way harder than she cares to admit. That woman supported me more than my own parents and she's become the sole reason I tried holding on in 2020 because while I didn't want to admit it, she was giving me a reason to at least try it one more time by simply believing in me more than I did.  Due to schools shutting down, I haven't seen her in a while and it becomes easier and easier to think of ending my life without immediately being reminded of her tearing up over her late students. I know it isn't ideal to keep holding on for someone else, but it's always worked up 'til now, so it scares the crap out of me that it isn't enough anymore.  I want to reach out for help but my hopes have been built up and crushed so many times that I don't know if I'll survive another negative result. I used to call my past teacher (she's been like a grandma and has supported me immensely through this year) but the last time we spoke we parted on bad terms and haven't spoken since. I kinda want to call her but I am afraid of rejection, because I know I wouldn't survive that. My mental health is a very fragile construct right now and I don't know what to do without everything collapsing. I don't even have a therapist at the moment that I could ask for help, so I am really at a crossroads of life and death right now."

Since leaving university in June during the pandemic I've been isolated out of the way unable to see anyone or do anything that I enjoy. I see my friends enjoying their lives whilst I am not enjoying mine and I've been left with some dark thoughts always on my mind. And it's something that the occasional message or call when the rest of everyone's lives is free enough to squeeze a quick one in before they go on to enjoying themselves doesn't fix, if anything it makes me feel worse and it ends up making the relationships with people I care about start to turn sour.

I often think that it would be easier to end my life as a rhetoric that just keeps going around in my head, but especially as all I can see is it getting worse I think it is becoming more of a fact that someday that will likely happen and I'm surprisingly accepting of that. Almost in the same way that I may come to accept having a terminal disease.

In that regard I would want to have some conversations with friends that were meaningful for not just me but for them too, whilst they may not be aware it was as impactful a conversation until afterwards. Perhaps about how I am feeling to help them understand or to help me, but at the same time not changing their opinion of me/the way they treat me/becoming a burden. Alternatively maybe just making sure I say all I want to them so they have an element of closure in part without me just distancing myself from them even further. Is there any way I can facilitate this in a useful way?"

I am also struggling with work (50% mh, 50% COVID) and because of the way our lives are intertwined, if they were to get hurt our quality of life would go down the drain. I’m worried that the next time I wake up, I’ll find a body or a note. I’m truly terrified of what might happen and I can’t find a well paying job in order to take the pressure off of them.

I can never share my true emotions around anyone, no matter how much I want to, because I've conditioned myself to not show them.

To give a quick run down of the situation. 

Met nice girl in clinic 4 months ago. 

Got into relationship with her way to quick. 

Realised about one month ago that my fear of losing her will cause just that. (Which it did)

She breaks up for reasons which are understandable, yet I disagree with.

Today is 11 days later. I decided to give it one last shot, talk to her one last time to see if we can work things out, since based on her goodbye message she still had feelings for me, but chose to end things anyhow. 

I drove all the way over to her place, as I had no other way of contacting her since I deleted every way to do it (To prevent any sort of pathetic spamming or similar on my end to forget her quicker) and rang the bell. 

For the last few days I've been thinking about what I even want to say and how I feel regarding this whole situation. Looking forward to a chance of speaking to her again gave me a lot of motivation these past few days, more than I had... maybe ever. I even cleaned my room which is something that I haven't done since I can remember.

Her younger brother opened, I asked if I could talk to her.

Based on what he said after asking her I can only imagine what she said to him. Probably something like ""Tell him I'm busy"".
He seemed really sad when saying it too, maybe Maja is feeling like shit too, I'm not sure. 

Told him that if she wants to talk to me, she should message me. But of course I know she won't. 


This kinda destroyed me. It was 4 hours ago now. After I got back home one hour later, I quickly decided to try hanging myself again, as I've often tried before. The problem is, I don't think I'm actually suicidal. I become extraordinarily scared of death the moment I have the chance to actually go through with it. This time I even got it tight around my neck, but I just sat there and cried for what must've been an hour.

It's pathetic. I'm pathetic. The reason I wanted to die, which is always the reason, is that I refuse to accept things as they are. 

This time I wanted to convince myself that the last 3 months didn't happen, that I was still in the clinic, having just played tabletennis with her, followed by just laying in the grass for an hour, as we often did. That I would do that again the next day. 

I want to die believing that to be the truth. I don't want this to be the truth. 

But I couldn't do it. I couldn't convince myself that if I kill myself, I could go back to that time. The only time I considered worth having lived through."

I can't remember that feeling at all.

I can't remember the last time I genuinely felt peace. My mind is torturing me. It's skinning me alive, all while laughing in my face. The voices will finally be gone; the demons, gone.

&#x200B;

Today's date, the 30th of December. It's near Christmas, New Years, and other close family celebrations. I love my family so much. I know they love me. They don't deserve to feel the pain of losing their son.. their brother.. the kindest of souls.. but I can't carry on living this nightmare for someone else's happiness.

I'm 17. The pain is unimaginable. It's so scary. We're all quick to judge, so before you think to yourself ""What a whiny fucking teenager,"" please remember that you can never know what's happened on the other end.

The heartache. The constant hammering of my already shattered, bleeding, screaming heart. Whenever I think it can't get worse, it always somehow gets worse.

How can I do this to my brother? How can I just leave him? It's not fair to him.

But I can't anymore. It hurts. It hurts too much. I've tried my best, but I've reached my limits. I've let down everyone around me and destroyed my image.

I don't think I can turn back anymore. I've taken several Ritalin pills. My heart rate keeps jumping between 100 - 150 beats per minute. I'm hallucinating, seeing glimmers of light zoom past my eyes. Auditory hallucinations - hearing screaming.

I was in the hospital last week. Same thing, I took several Ritalin pills causing me to have a seizure and dislocating my shoulder. Now I'm sitting here in my bed writing this with my arm and mental in pain.

I hope this isn't just another seizure leading me to being stuck in the hospital with my family crying and doctors giving me meds and writing reports sending it to the municipality and social services. My family has done nothing wrong, It's all me. What's happened to me over these last six months.. I don't recognize myself.

Edit #1: Guess it wasn't this time... or maybe i'll wake up at 4 am tonight like last time with severe cramps & seizure with no recollection of what happened. ill update this if im able to i guess, good night

Edit #2 (19 feb 2021): still here"

I feel like I’ve told it to many people, and by the end of it they always seem to just say “you’ll be okay” or “you’ll be fine”. I’m so tired of telling it, I really am. But I’m gonna try one more time..
I’m 22. Im engaged. I’m a college student working part time at a vet clinic. Animals are my passion. Well everything is falling apart on me. About 3-4 weeks ago my fiancé’s grandfather passed away. It was the first time he lost someone he was close to. I was unable to attend the funeral with him as it was a 12 hr drive one way, so he rode with his sisters. He was gone for 4 days. It was the first time we had slept apart in over a year at least. I had horrible panic attacks, and thoughts of wanting to self harm. I talked to my therapist about them. My fiancé got back and things felt.. different. The day he got home, I arrived home from work and he was on the phone with his mom. And I could hear her. And she was saying really mean things about me about how I don’t contribute enough and how I need to move out. I was extremely hurt, especially since I thought his mom liked me. I texted his sister to vent. She has vented to me before multiple times, even times about their mom. I even asked her to keep it between us. And I vented and told her I just wanted to call his mom and set her straight. She told me with everything my fiancé had going on that was the last thing to do. I repeated that I was just venting and I wasn’t actually going to do that. And then she basically told me she doesn’t think I should be with him either. And then she proceeded to tell everyone, my fiancé, her sister and her mom what I had said. So of course his mom calls him about me. So she created the EXACT drama she said I shouldn’t create (and that I had no intentions on creating!) so then I knew I couldn’t trust her. And after trying and trying to get my fiancé to talk to me about his feelings and stuff and not hold things in, he finally admitted that he wasn’t sure if he wanted to marry me anymore. That he needed to think on the relationship, but that we aren’t breaking up just yet, he just wasn’t sure what the right choice was. The next day I went to work and I wasn’t doing good mentally. I asked if I could take the second half of the day off (I wasn’t even technically supposed to work that day, I had been asked to cover someone’s shift) and the hospital administrator came in to talk to me. She basically told me I’m unreliable and made it sound like if I went home then they were either going to fire me or cut my hours. So I stayed. I ended up accidentally stabbing myself while trying to draw up a vaccine because I was shaking from crying. Then they post the next schedule for the week of January. They cut my hours by a lot. I’m now only work 2 half days the entire week. So I’m upset. I can’t live off of 10 hrs. Plus if my fiancé and I break up, I’ll have to move back in with my parents. It’s an hr and 45 mins away. So I probably won’t have my job much longer. Then his mom was being extra difficult and wanted to see him ON Christmas Day even though she was going to see his sister who lives 6 hrs away and he already had plans to go see his daughter that morning and then Christmas with my parents that night. Yea she wanted him to cancel seeing his own daughter and going with me to my parents. So he ended up getting her to accept Christmas Eve. So he left the day before Christmas Eve, stayed through Christmas Eve, and came back on Christmas morning to see his daughter. Christmas night something felt off with him again. Finally I said “I used to mean a lot to u. U used to tell me I was the best thing that ever happened to u... and that doesn’t really feel like it’s true anymore” and he was silent. And I asked “am I wrong” and he whispered back no. I’ve failed in my classes, vet school is going to be almost impossible to get into. The one in my state has a higher acceptance rate at 13%. Everything has fallen apart and I’m fucking tired. I have no friends. No one to really talk to about this. I have no money. I can’t just keep seeing my therapist every week. I can’t afford that. I’m just... idk. I’m so tired. I’m really extremely tired. I just want to call it quits. The only reason I haven’t is because of my parents. It would hurt them so much. But I’ve written notes in case I do end up doing it."

After a few minutes of this, I broke down crying and punched a wooden post in frustration, making my knuckles bleed, and cried at the sidewalk for a while. I feel like shit. I wanted to die but I couldn't bring myself to do it. So I'm stuck here still."

From what I can remember, I've felt like this since I was near 12 years old. I'm now 22 and I feel like I've lost who I am. I no longer care for hobbies and can't even list one that I've done for the past three years. Social media bores me, it's all the same. Work feels like I'm living the same shift on repeat. I'm a fourth year student and still remain on the president's list (straight A's) but it doesn't feel like an achievement. From an outsiders perspective I have nothing to be sad about. I live in a house with my boyfriend, we have a dog, I do great in school, I work 2 part time jobs and have an extremely loving family and friends. But I feel numb. I have to convince myself to get out bed, brush my teeth, do my makeup. I'm slowly deteriorating. 

I've lived like this before, but I'm getting worse. I've been on 2 different anti-depressants and even increased my dose and felt it was no help. I follow all the common symptoms and no one notices. I feel as though I've moved from suicidal ideation to now actually thinking about it as if it is near date. I've been put on a waiting list 6-9 months to see a psychiatrist. I told my symptoms to my doctor and his literal response was ""Oh boy"". 

How am I supposed to get help when there is none. I paid $700 in therapy fees last month, I can't afford help. By the time I finally get to see a psychiatrist I don't even think I'll be around. Half of the inpatient programs you need to be admitted by emergency, which is pushing me to hurt myself even more. I'm crying while writing this because I'm scared, yet it all feels inevitable. 

I just don't know who I am anymore. So much negativity and depression just surrounds me that I've become it. I'm extremely jealous of those who just smile for no reason, what I would give to feel that just once. I just don't think my soul was ever meant to live on earth."

She tries to blame everything on electronics and me being dramatic one day, then flips around and gives me autism self help books the other day. (I am autistic so I guess she's trying?) 

I'm terrified of going home. I've cried in the campus parking lot because I didn't wanna go home. I hide in my room because it's my only safe place. I go without showering for days because I know I'm not leaving the house. I leave the house as often as I can just so I can be away from her, but it doesn't matter since she forced me to put a tracker on my phone. (I'm 18 and have been driving for two years, so this makes little sense.) She's recently been taking away my phone because she says I'm addicted, but it's my only lifeline to the friends who care about me. She's forcing me to stay in a relationship that I don't want to be in anymore after this man has been molesting me for months.

Today I tried opening up to her about it all. She blew up at me and said that I'm addicted to electronics, that my depressive thoughts were me being a drama queen, and that I should think about how she feels. I have thought about how she feels. I just don't care anymore. There's no point to it all. I told her that I hate myself and she tried guilt tripping me, saying, ""Yeah, because it's always my fault, isn't it?""

I have my gun right next to my bed. I have medicines that could kill my heart in the medicine cabinet. There's a tower 15 minutes drive from here where I can jump from the top and be nothing but a splatter on the pavement. I want out of this house because I have nowhere to go.

I don’t want to stop, I hate myself too much. It is not like I cut deep anymore, I do enough too bead up. I crave the wince the sting the burn for a bit. But like 15 of them at a time just enough for a “nice burn” you see I’m talking like an addict. Fuck. My emotions get so overwhelming I shoot numb. And it’s not completely numb which is the worst part. It’s the dissociation, everything feels numb and blank but I won’t cry or have any emotion showing but inside I’m screaming my head off and have urges to rip my skin apart. It’s like I’m trying to escape myself, as I see my scars. I’m killing my boyfriend. I’m burdening my friends, and I do not have many. No one understands me I just want someone to understand. I’ve tried posting before on her  but still I feel alienated. And I get really upset when I talk to a manipulative attention seeker, it triggers me please stay away I was traumatized by my parents, thank you. It’s 7 am and I’m having a breakdown cutting myself a bit. And to think my depression at 3 am at 13 yrs old was the worst, now 19 supposed to be “living” but am cutting myself to gain some control at 8 o clock in the morning. My boyfriend works full time, he is even paying rent rn. I’m losing my shit and nothing is happening. Growing up was hell with my drug using parents, but they are gone now. What the hell is wrong. I feel so fucking alone. In my heart I just want a friend to connect with, I don’t talk to anyone all day everyday. Only my bf and as I said this poor man is gonna end up putting a bullet in his head bc of me. He loves me so much but fuck do I use his energy. He helps as much as he can but I’m a fucken mess. I’ve always been a mess since 13 I haven’t been able to ever “get better” it just seems I’ll deteriorate over time. Seems I’ll cut myself to death by the way things are going.

I copy and pasted a part that I posted on self harm ^ 
However I realize this more than self harm. I don’t self harm bc I want to die, but I do want to die. I just happen to wanna die and self harm. I cut myself bc I hate my body. Just my body and everything about it. I wanna die bc the pain I always experience pain. Wake up with panic attacks. Anxiety dreams. Night sweats. Insomnia. Hypersomnia. Wake up with anxiety, fall asleep with anxiety. Social anxiety. Paranoia. Maladaptive daydreaming. I don’t eat for days and than I eat too much in two days. Wtf is the matter with me?

I'm 27 and I feel a constant pressure every freaking day becuase I dont fill up the standard that my family and the society (place I live) want to impose on me.

I lost my job due to something I did (which they never told me what it was and I last 2 years being the most applied than ever supervisor came to me looking for answers) and was the first one after 9 years looking for one. I cant even use my degree to even find a job unless I sell my soul to someone (""nepotism""). Now, my family wants me to start a 3rd degree just because they heard God tell them about it.

I have suicidal thoughts and no, I havent try anything for the moment; but what I feel is something like my mind is already dead like 'yep, I gonna cross the street without see to both side who cares'. 

I have an weird anxiety where I cannot do anything becuase my mind goes at 100km thinking about everything without finding a solution. And no, I dont have a girlfriend or a friend that I can talk becuase first if I dont have job/money some girls wont talk to you; second some of my friends (I have like 4-5) cant talk to them becuase they do not have solution or have some of the problems like me

Also, my parents say that with my degree or the things I know outside my career cant get me a decent job or get independent like most young people they see; and I tell them ""yes they have than me becuase they use know someone in a higher position and they dont know how to do their job, and when I want to apply to some place they denied me everytime since I had 18 years old""

And I cant fill my expectation, like yeah I can learn, do this etc blah blah. But for christ sake..I have to do what others say just because they think is better but when I said something or would like to do anything is not value or not worthy. I even wrap my hand and star hitting the walls or go riding my bike for 1 hour, but I think 'f*** I have to return to my home and pass all that again, I should get futher away until I get unconsious in some place very far'

I have been to psicologies since I was 18 and they tell me 'you should not think like that' or ""you should this/that'..like whoa sherlock I have never thought about it😒. It almost a family therapy where I get to say when we leave to the doctors ""you just said something to me that I already thought nothing new..and you talk with my family that I know will forget everything in 1 week"". And yes, I have an rage inside (which I keep acumulating) becuase men..there's coming a new year I have nothing else to be happy with it"

I'm always afraid to talk to people and I barely associate with the few friends I have because of social anxiety. 

No girl wants me. Every girl I try to be with rejects me. I feel like I'm so ugly and not worth anyone's time. I'm tired of feeling like this. I just want to fucking end my life already. I'm constantly alone with no one to talk to. Most people just use me because they want something from me. Only reason why I haven't offed myself is because of my mom. She's had a hard life and lost so much people in her life. 

My uncle just died over the weekend and she is so broken up. I feel like if I kill myself it would break her. I don't want to do that to her, but I just don't want to live anymore. I feel like I'm trapped in a world I don't want to be in. I just wish I wasn't so alone and a girl would actually give me the time of day. Anyways thanks for listening to me vent.

the first time that i did reach out for professional help i was promised that i would be referred to a couple of places, one that would help me out with my dysphoria and one that would possibly get me an autism or adhd diagnosis. but i found out like a year after that neither of those places had me on any waiting lists. the second time i tried to reach out i couldnt even make an appointment with my doctor because of some computer system error and my case wasn't deemed urgent enough apparently.

kn47ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kn47ff/im_not_sure_what_to_do_anymore/,I'm not sure what to do anymore,3,1,1609342060.0,"I'm a 16 year old male, and for the first time, I'm truly ready to die.

In the past, I've had suicidal thoughts. I've attempted a few times, but quickly stopped from fear. But I feel like I'm ready to die now.

My mental health is in freefall, and I feel completely lost. I feel like that's a big misconception about depression. For me, the world isn't crashing and burning around me - the world is fine. I'm the one that's crashing.

I've tried to cope in many different ways over the past few years - self harm, self poisoning, hurting my body against objects, eating too much, eating too little, etc. Hell, I even had a masturbation addiction at one point. I hate that I couldn't stop myself from doing these things, but I understand why I did them - to transform emotional pain to physical pain.

I don't trust my parents. Whenever someone is upset in my house (which is mainly me), they immediately get annoyed. I tried to open up to them in the past but it's like they're completely unfeeling towards it, even trying to avoid talking about it at all. I remember one time I self harmed and didn't try to hide it. I guess that was my way of going ""please, PLEASE notice me. Please, see what is happening. I need your help."" But when my parents saw, all they did was scold me for it. They called me childish and said I was only doing it for attention. In a way, I guess I was.

I just wanted them to listen. Whenever I mess up, it's all verbal insults. Recently, I started sixth form, and to avoid my ever-darkening thoughts, I buried myself in work, completing notes for a 2-year A-Level course in the timespan of 6 days. My parents kept saying I should have a work-life balance, so I started playing Minecraft while on call with my friends. They didn't like that. They started calling me lazy, and saying I do nothing anymore. I didn't know what to think, or how to feel anymore. Whenever I try to go up to my room throughout the day, they get mad, saying I disappear. They make me spend as much of the day downstairs with them as possible, but we don't do anything together. Except when we're forced to watch movies together EVERY NIGHT. They don't even care about what I want.

To clarify, I live in a family of 6, and have 3 siblings. I'm the oldest, and so am forced to look after them. This is fine, but it's like my parents expect me to be their full-time parent, and they barely do anything anymore. My sisters are 5 and 6 years old, and I'm expected to help them with all their homework. My brother, who is 12, has autism. I am also expected to help him with any work he has. Along with this, I have chores. A lot of them. I do the dishes, hoovering the house (which is reasonably large), do all the dust, clean the bathrooms, wash the outside of both my parent's cars, along with hoovering the inside of the cars. I have to cut the grass in the garden, along with shower my sisters, and hoover downstairs every single day. I do not get paid for this, but I never expected to get paid for helping my family. My problem is that they don't do anything to help me, instead scolding me when I accidentally mess up, or if I haven't cleaned properly.

I can't take this responsibility anymore, along with all the work I have from school, and all the exams I have to prepare for. It's too much.

I've tried to speak to my parents about this, but, as you might have guessed by now, all they do is get angry with me and punish me even more - taking away my phone and laptop, the second of which I actually need for my homework and studying. They don't care.

I know I'm not perfect - I'd argue I'm on the worse side of humanity. I find myself getting angry quite easily, along with panicked. When my sisters start arguing with me or lying, I get really stressed and angry, often arguing or shouting back. The same goes for my 12 year old brother. We get into fights, with him taunting me or hitting me, and I hit back, but I hit back hard (due to me being older). I feel terrible for it. I tend to self harm whenever I do - as punishment.

I've tried to talk about some of this to my parents, but they get mad at me. So, naturally, I decided to confide in my close friends.

I don't hang around many people. 5 or 6 of the people I talk to I would consider my friends, but I only have 3 close ones. One of them, when I talked to about this, sympathized, and understood more than most. But, over time, I was constantly being reminded how I'm doing better off than most people, yet I'm still complaining about life. It hurts even more because what he is saying is true, and I have no excuse for that. Another friend, one which I considered my closest for a long time, was told by me about my self harm and depression. She started making me promise to not do it, on the condition that if I did, she would stop eating, or hurt herself. I've grown apart from her, which I'm glad. I can't deal with that anymore, making empty promises, and hurting people when I inevitably break them. The last of my close friends doesn't know about any of this. They only noticed I self harmed, but only brought it up once. I don't want to tell them though. I know if I will, they'll see me differently, and I can't do that anymore - not to myself, and not to them, either.

I hardly sleep anymore. Whenever things go quiet, my suicidal thoughts and urge to self harm return. That's why I try to keep my mind busy at all times. When I'm doing something, I like to have my phone playing anything in the background, just so it distracts me more and more. I can't sleep easily, but I also sleep too much afterwards. It's all a vicious cycle, and my parents are getting more and more mad with me, and I hate myself more and more for disappointing them every day.

I know that if I keep on living, I'll end up hurting myself, or someone else. I can't afford to keep hurting people. I just want to die, and move on, anywhere.

I take medication for Raynaud's, which also doubles as high blood pressure medication. Since I have trouble sleeping, there would be no trouble me getting sleeping pills prescribed. Obviously, I'll try them a few days beforehand, to test how strong they are, and how long the effects are. Then, on a night where I know I won't be disturbed, I will take more high blood pressure medication than I should - this should slow my body's functions, even if it is a little bit. Then, I will take more than enough sleeping medication, and go to bed, with a plastic bag wrapped around my head via rubber bands, or something of the sort. I will wear a cap so that the bag doesn't stick to my face, and have a large enough bag so that I pass out before I lose oxygen.

I'll leave my suicide note on my desk, which would only contain me telling my family and friends how much I loved them, and how sorry I am - I won't be mentioning any of this thread, etc. I will then fall asleep, and eventually run out of oxygen, at which point my brain will begin decaying, and I will eventually die due to cerebral hypoxia. A peaceful end, and a quiet one too. The body would be mostly preserved.

I don't expect anyone to read all of this, but if you have, thank you. Truly. You've already done more than my family or friends ever have. I tried to talk to everyone, I've tried every option. I've tried self destructive methods like self-poisoning, self harming, not eating, eating a lot, sleeping too much, not sleeping, etc. I've tried ""normal"" methods such as therapy, opening up, but nothing has worked, and I believe it's far too late for me.

I'm just so lost, and I feel like death is my only escape. Even if it wasn't, I feel like it's the preferable option.

If there's anything you could say to help, or to give advice on, please do. I don't want sympathy, I just want to know if there's any better alternatives than death in my current situation. I just want to be at peace, and I'm sorry you've ever had to read this."

Absolutely terror inducing. Somehow dying tied down in an empty hospital room while nurses walk around outside oblivious would be way worse than just hanging myself alone in my room. Actually maybe it's because suicide is about control for me- the thought of choosing to control how I end my life feels good, while the thought of dying with absolutely no control over my last moments is horrifying."

When we finally started going out, I was already too far gone in my depression. The insecurities I developed droved her away. Covid happened few months into our relationship. Became extremely suicidal from not being able to see her, and eventually had a meltdown which made her leave.

7 years ago, if I got to know her, would I be happy today? Would I have followed a career path I loved? She was someone that believed people should follow their dreams. Would I still have developed all of my insecurities? Would I still be with her today?

I would trade everything I have so I could go back in time to the day I first saw her, 7 years ago."

I hate being a lesbian. Suicide is on my mind constantly and am going to take those steps. I hate being a lesbian more than anything. If I had to fix something about myself or life, I would give my arm to fix this. I have never been kissed, had a girlfriend or had sex. And I know I will never do any of those things. I can only fantasise. 

Only my sibling and maybe two friends know about my sexuality and I regret telling them. I won't ever come out of the closet. Or actually, I would come out if I ever get a girlfriend. But I know that's not going to happen. I will never tell anyone, it will die with me. I also have very homophobic parents, and I feel guilt everyday that I'm a failure to them, and I will disappoint them. 

I could go on and on about the reasons why. The dating pool is less than 2 percent. I'm not stereotypical in the slightest and am attracted to non stereotypical average women that you see everyday. Feeling isolated from every single person I know. Knowing most people will not accept me. So on and so forth. 

I'm very tired and drained. I have tried to accept it, or tell myself that it's fine. But it does not work. It is ingrained in my head that it is not OK and never will be.

There is absolutely no reason why I should accept or even tolerate it and have no idea why or how other gay people do it. I can't see any benefits. I don't want to be my ""true self"" because I don't like it. It's just not it for me. I feel like I was born with the wrong mind, or this gayness was meant to go to someone else but instead hit me. I'm not equipped to deal with this.

I don't see any other option. And that's fine. Suicide is the answer for some people, maybe I finally just got lucky"

It was only this year in May I realized how bad it was as it progressed and got really bad. Since then I have began to recover and have been doing well. I would go as far as to say early December I beat depression. 

However, although most days I'm doing so well. The smallest thing can set me off and put me right down to where I was before. The only difference is, I feel better after I sleep. This has been constant. So earlier today I had a massive argument with my friend over something silly. But he got a bit nasty and said some cruel things about my mental health. And that's put my mood down to how I was when I was depressed. I know when I wake up tomorrow I will feel fine. But everytime this happens, it ruins my day. I have no energy, I can't eat and I can't focus and do anything. My only solution is to lie in bed until I get tried so that I can sleep and feel better the next day.

Does anybody know when this will stop. As I find days like today so difficult and I really want to get over it already. And if anyone can give me some advice for anything, please do. Because right now I feel awful. Thank you"

I’m a pretty good looking tall dude too so I never would guessed I be this lonely or depressed for that matter.  Some of this is my fault For sure no way around it but some of it is just the way the cookies crumbled.

      I don’t have much family on the count that my moms adopted and she never been close with much of any of her family.  I feel like that’s something that isn’t talked about a lot. Being the kid of someone who’s adopted can be a pretty rough time with family. My dad is a drunk I can’t stand to be around. He not abusive too others just to him self so it’s kinda hard to watch. He’s the black sheep of his family too so, I’m kinda left out on his side as well. I recently had a son with someone who’s main goal is too make my life a living hell. We were off and on really and I was under the impression she was on birth control. She’s 8 years older than me I’m only 21, and she hasn’t let me be apart of any of the child’s life. And she makes a Fortune more than me so if I go for 50/50 custody she will win out a long engagement in the court. She has a habit of painting me like I’m trying to abuse her. She’s called the cops when she’s thrown me out of her apartment but didn’t give me my keys or my 600 dollar wallet!!! That situation barrel it is something I could control makes do you know I’m losing a court case that was built off of pure lies. So Gaining control of my son is a little bit of impossible feat right now! 

 This situation has been very frustrating since I don’t really have much family my mom lives in Florida I live in Indiana she’s only person that would really help my grandparents don’t really seem to care and I don’t really have any other family outside of that to go to. My job is really stressful the holidays have been a complete and total emotional mess on my end! The one grandmother I had that would help has dementia and she’s in a nursing home so I wasn’t able to see her! Everything just seems like a piece of shit as of lately I really want to play video games anymore my house feels like a prison I’m just starting to lose hope in my life forever be better than this. Can you call depression when it’s just the overall feeling of your life is just bland. I don’t know I wish somebody could tell me but I do know that I’m getting tired of being here because of all this. I view myself as a good person but all the things stocked around me doesn’t really seem like i am. Maybe I deserve all of this inside some twisted way I don’t know. 🤷🏾‍♂️"

I have been dealing with so much resurfacing childhood trauma lately and I am dissociating heavily. Last night I went to bed praying for God to kill me in my sleep, and the thought of it actually happening made me feel so calm and content. I woke up multiple times during the night in complete panic and everytime I woke up I just started praying for God to kill me when I fall asleep again. 

I almost did it myself a few months ago, but I was able to resist the urge and stick around a little longer. I planned everything and I still have that exact same plan in my mind. I have the equipment and I can do it whenever, but I seriously am trying to fight the urge. It's tough. 

I felt better in the morning but during the day I have started to dissociate more and more, and right now as I am writing this, I have no clue what the fuck is even going on. I don't even know if what I'm writing makes sense, but I am trying my hardest. All I can think of right now is death. The thought of taking my own life gets me full of excitement and makes me feel almost complete euphoria. I held the rope in my hand today and just couldn't stop smiling. I tried tying the rope around my neck and adding a little pressure, and I loved the feeling of not being able to breathe and my ears starting to ring. Not being able to think. I have a red mark around my neck from it. I have been suicidal since I was a kid ( my mom even told me that she once found a suicide note I wrote when I was 7-8 years old ) but I have never been this close to actually doing it. I have swallowed some pills in the past but nobody knows about it and I know that I really wasn't ready to die back then so I wasn't trying seriously. 

The more the years pass, the more suicidal and unstable I become. Taking my own life doesn't feel like a fantasy anymore, it feels like a reality that is going to happen sooner or later. It doesn't even scare me in the slightest anymore, I have just come to accept it."

Only child, I don’t have to do anything for the things I have, and many other privileges. I just felt like sharing since I thought I was getting better, but I’m starting to get sadder and emptier. 

I went to a private Catholic school for grades 1-8. It was a a small school, and I had an avg 16 kids in my class throughout, and even that was the biggest in the school. I don’t know when things went wrong at that school. Maybe grade 6-7? I don’t remember much from around that time, and I’m glad I don’t. 

I didn’t fit in so I wanted to change. A lot of us started using social media too, although I’ve never really used it, even today. I guess it was a mixture of peer pressure and other factors that made me develop a different personality just for school. It was incredibly tiring. I wanted to go back, but at the time I realized, it was too late to just revert to a personality I couldn’t even remember. I guess I was an attention-seeker, according to my teachers. I did stupid shit just for laughs, like banging my head against my desk, eating disgusting stuff, or laughing incredibly obnoxiously loud when we were watching a video as a class just for some other “friends” to laugh. I got in trouble for a lot of the shit I pulled off. Looking back it was incredibly stupid to do this for people who never contacted me outside of school. The amount of times they talked about some meeting or gathering that I wasn’t a part of was numerous.

Thinking back on the “girlfriend” I had at around 8th grade makes me want to die so I’m gonna skip that. These last two points are also relevant to the prank call I got from the same girl a while later. It was at a party I wasn’t invited to... I remember being excited thinking we were gonna get back together or something but.. yeah. I was very uhh down after that.

It was around the end of eighth grade that I decided to just alienate myself from the class. I got a lot less sleep just so I could sleep during the first period of the day to not talk to people. At first I would just pretend to be asleep with my head down, but I could still hear them talking about various things...  so I really wanted to just sleep. I wasn’t bullied, so there wasn’t anything anyone could do for me. It was truly a situation I put myself in. I used to be a really social kid as well (maybe I should’ve started with this). I even had a fucking girlfriend in kinder. Like we kissed and shit, both of our parents knew. No one believes me now obviously but I also can’t believe how I was such a social butterfly when I was little. Where’d it all go wrong...

Then came high school. For some background info, I moved somewhere else in 6th grade but still went to that private school since I was afraid of public schools, and at seventh I decided I could tolerate another year. But once I graduated 8th grade I went to a school near me and I naturally knew no one. I joined the basketball team just so I wouldn’t be alone the whole year. Well, I ate lunch by myself for the first 2 months anyway since my teammates were popular. Luckily, I found like 3 ok friends and I hung out with them for the year. Oh and I was absolute ass at basketball by the way. It was natural since I had no talent and was doing it for friends. Never going into games didn’t really affect me though since I never gave a shit about it in the first place. 

Anyway we move to the quarantine stay at home order. Needless to say, I didn’t even need to adapt to  it since it was incredibly similar to how I spent my winter and summer breaks since no one would talk to me and I’d stay at home all the time. The only difference is that I occasionally text one friend that I hung out with at school. One thing I’m afraid of though is that I’m gonna get too attached to this guy. One time I thought of him dying and I started crying uncontrollably... like I’m not gay but knowing that this guy, who probably thinks nothing of these occasional texts, can make me so emotional at the thought of them dying makes me feel really bad.

The loneliness is something I like to think I’ve gotten used to. Anime is really important to me as it got me through grade 7&8. The reason i think I’ve improved is that I don’t even watch anime anymore. Well, I did have two breakdowns this year (never had them before) so maybe it did have an effect on me, but that’s in the past. I’ve learned to live with my pitiful self. A line from an anime I’ve seen was “if you don’t like yourself you might as well kill yourself.” It sounds incredibly silly, I’m aware, but it drives me to find anything, literally anything about me to like, since I can’t kill myself. Maybe that’s why I’m still able to go on.

With all that out there, can someone give me hope? I don’t know just something to hold onto? I feel so aimless right now. I honestly wish I could switch bodies with one of you because I feel like I’ve wasted this life. I have fucking everything I need and more but literally no one knows me. And I’m scared. I’m scared of changing this seclusive lifestyle of mine. I don’t want to wear that mask I wore for so long. Every time  I meet someone other than my parents I put on the same fake smile I used to have, and fuck it dreads me to have to be someone else again. Right now I feel like a hollow husk with no soul dwelling in my body. Who  even am I? I don’t know anymore. 

Am I over my head? Is this normal? Am I exaggerating? There are so many questions I have unanswered since I have never opened up to anyone before. If you’ve made it to here thank you for listening to this pathetic boy’s summarized story. I know I’m truly gonna be alone since I plan on taking this story to the grave, so at the very least this post will relief some of that loneliness."

(reposting from r/raisedbynarcissists)

&#x200B;

Bio: I am new to reddit and I am an adult female child of a narcissistic mother. I don't have any money currently.

And I don't have any school, the last formal education I was given is primary school.

I don't have ID card, so applying for work/school myself is impossible. So as going to another city etc.

I don't have the freedom to go out/I am trapped.

This month I tried to escape after finding work as a housemaid that give food and living place on top of monthly wage, but failed due to the door key changed without my knowledge, I am really close to attempting suicide after that.

&#x200B;

I've always been abused lightly all my life though the one that hurt the most that my brain can remember is when I'm 6, it's a mental abuse.

My more violent abuses start from my teenage days when I have the courage and hormones? to rebel. That b play the ""she's (me) a demon"" game, got me exorcised repeatedly.

And that continue on for 4 years (with an addition of being depressed and suicidal, not getting schools or any kind of education, not going out since every spesies on that environment are my abusers who openly act that way (even until today (so i'll go insane way faster if i were to go out)), not doing any kind of hygiene (beside the depression it's also because I just can't help myself (initially), because that b said i don't wash myself because i'm a demon (i'm triggered to death, put depression on top, i ended up literally volunteering to keep laying on my bed)), continuously doing a half-hearted suicide attempts by starvatlon, and doing ""talks"" to that b, which yes as you expected useless and just wasted my precious priceless breaths).

&#x200B;

\-----------

&#x200B;

I am currently technically living with my narcissistic biological mother (i can't stand calling it ""mother"" so the biological is necessary!!!!!!!). I'm not sure I'm being raised or not lol.

As I titled, I can't function anymore now, this is too much than what I'm capable of.  

In dreams I'd get nightmares. Being awake is when real suffer constantly activating.  

I wish I can just fcking sleep 24/7 (since nightmares are way better) but no human can do that.....

I self diagnosed myself with OCD. And this is not just some i-feel-sorry-for-myself-sht. I've experienced this for years and currently experiencing it, always didn't wanted to accept the fact that I probably have OCD but for some months prior I think, I finally searched up OCD symptoms and such and sht I'm right...  

OCD and mental torments really is an unsustainable combo... I really can't do this anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm a natural coward. And all my childhood the narcissisms isn't so bad (I'm just constantly being the scapegoat, got told shts about me, bullied to do all necessary and unnecessary chores (by my egg donor and older sibling), still got my school, still got her fake attention and caring (which brainwashed me into thinking my egg donor is still my mom and so lessen my pains), still got my food and protection? to some extent).  

But now it's so bad. She's quite open about it but fake shts all the passing second as well. I can't quite explain it. I'm not used to her narcissistic ways and tbh I don't want to be used to that too.

&#x200B;

It'll be long so to make it short, I'm in constant worry whether I'll die of suicide or not because my egg donor keep pushing me. I tried self helf shts but how the fck can I improve when I'm constantly tormented every fcking millisecond so I just can't get out of my suicidal patterns...

&#x200B;

So I really can't do this anymore...  

I don't even know what's wrong with me anymore/my problems that I need to fix.

And, am I really the one's that wrong/the problem?

Prior to this, 1-2 weeks ago I did something to saved my life, had it succeeded. But that it's not, I feel like I'm getting weaker and so I can't do this anymore.

I really can't help myself so I can't help but reading self help shts again, and people talk about how thinking about the past is useless and it's more beneficial to think of the now, but I really can't help myself.......  

I wish my escape plan really succeeded then, I really can't do this anymore!!!!!!  

What stopped me from killing myself in the past is because ""I want to make them pay""/""I think it's unfair the victim is the one that have to die"".  

But nowadays it's just, ""There's a high chance I won't die so let's not bother"".  

But I've came as what I thought of so close last time when my escape failed...... And as of now, I think something like brain damages, paralyzed body, or whatever other shts would be so fcking better. I just can't do this anymore.

I really don't want to die since I've come so far!!! But...... what do I do if I only see it as my only saver???

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Honestly I don't even know why I'm here writing this all, I actually read quite a lot of posts here before I decided to make an account and write this all. So I read this thing about natural instict? or something that prevent you to die?  

Lol. It's probably that.  

I probably try to save myself yet again.  

I think I really don't want to die. But suffering as I'm still alive is not an option.  

If that's how it is then I can't help but I ""have"" to die.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is death the only way?  

Is there someone who can say no and actually explain, why is that so? And whatever that someone explain, can it just not be bullshts like friends, support circle support group whatever, therapist, and/or \\\*put things that need other people here\\\*.  

I don't have the resource(s) for those.  

I need something free and easy that only need me and me only. And something that can work when my confusing self keep getting hurt by their mentally abusive ways (I'm not hurt as much before the failed escape happened, but idk why I'm hurt so much with their never ending abusive ways right now).  

I hope I'm not asking much..

I really can't do this anymore........"

I’ve been stuck in some heavy suicidal ideation for a few days now, and this has led me on a rabbit hole into places where people commit suicide. Unsurprisingly, bridges are rather popular for different reasons. 

The solution to stopping bridge suicides? Suicide barriers or nets to catch people who attempt. 
Looking into this, I’ve noticed a disturbing trend. 

The main reason people push back against adding a barrier is because “it will disrupt the scenery.” I thought this was a one off thing regarding a certain bridge, but I found yet another article regarding a bridge on the other side of the world stating the exact same reason. (They typically mention costs as well, but if I recall correctly, suicides are technically more costly than a safety net in the long run.)

But I am just completely baffled. I knew from a young age that many humans don’t give a rat’s ass about each other, but it makes what’s left of my emotions fall into despair. These people in charge are saying scenery > human lives. Simple as that. It’s disgusting. I’m sure there are ways of incorporating a suicide barrier that won’t affect the bridge or surrounding areas too much, but at the end of the day, shouldn’t human lives matter more?

People act as though life is to be treasured, as if it’s this sacred and beautiful thing. For a while (and even now at times) I didn’t understand why people wanted to help me. My psychiatrist, therapist, mental hospitals, doctors, family, friends. But I think I’m figuring it out. It’s because my existence, my suffering benefits these people. My mental issues and exhaustion at living puts money in the former’s pockets, and me being alive allows friends and family to avoid the grief of losing me. 

But when presented with this bridge dilemma, the ugly face of humanity rears its head. They see the total deaths from bridge jumping in a year and shrug, looking the other way. They don’t know anyone who jumped. Why should they care or spend money on someone who is just a number now? 

This is most likely a rambling mess, but I just needed to get these thoughts out there. I know a lot of suicidal people could care less about there being suicide barriers or nets, but there’s a lot of people out there who regretted jumping as soon as their feet left the railing. I know not everyone is like this, but many are. 

Wherever you are, I hope your pain eases and you sleep well tonight."

I'm 22 years old with no hopes of future and an absolutely fucked up mental health. I'm unable to work and I cut myself. I act like a fucking chilld even though I shouldn't. Right now I'm drunk in the morning and didn't eat in 2 days. I didn't masturbate in a while which was one of my last coping mechanisms I had in life. Situation is fucking bleak, no reason to continue and no hope for improvement. I'm so sick of living like this. I don't do any housework and even ignore my hygiene, don't brush my teeth or shower at all. I hope so bad that one day I'll be able to do it.

I got straight As my first semester and im currently going into my second semester. 4.0 gpa for my first semester seems great but I pussied out due to the pandemic and took easy classes to fulfill general education requirements. I decided to pass/no pass a class instead of opting for a letter grade cuz im shit at writing philosophy papers. I struggled to find motivation to power through my classes even though they were all supposed to be really easy. I signed up for a technical class required for my intended major in the spring but that's it. The rest of my classes are for more general education requirements and one for fun.

Now I'm realizing that I'll need to take at least 3-4 technical courses my sophomore year in order to be able to declare my major on time. This is all because I decided to be a pussy and not take any hard classes during a pandemic. The university I attend is known for being hyper-competitive and getting a grade less than an A- is like a death sentence. Hell, even an A- is enough cause for a heart attack. I dont know what my future will be. I want to go to medical school, but it seems near impossible because of all the competition here. I made up for my garbage grades and test scores in high school by taking up extracurriculars, but that was easy because I went to a ghetto high school. Now that im at a pretty reputable university with way too many students and way too little resources, I have to somehow fight my way to the top.

I havent even made any friends my first semester in uni. I dread having to go to zoom meetings and getting cold-called by my professors and graduate student instructors. I dont attend office hours because im a pussy. I have a poor attention span, live in an extremely rowdy house with constant arguments, and im just not cut out for university. 

I wanna think it's the pandemic that's messing up my vibe, but thinking back on high school, I always did the bare minimum and didn't give a crap about learning. All I wanted was the grade and if that grade was a B, I was okay with it. I always crammed information into my head for an exam and then proceed to dump it out when I finished the class and repeat the process again. Ask me a question and I'll explain it incoherently and probably even inorrectly as well. I decided to do something about it during my winter break and actually prep for the chemistry class I signed up for. 

Even while trying to prep for chem, fucking stoichiometry was eating my ass, and that's like one of the first things they teach in college chemistry. How the fuck am I going to survive if I dont know how to do basic fucking math. Speaking of math, I'm doghsit at math.

I realize I've been going on a rant for far too long. Basically, I dont know what the fuck im going to do with my life. People will tell me there's always going to be second chances for college or whatever, but I only got one shot. My parents are getting old, I cant leech off of them forever. I just can't fail any of my classes and I need to get good enough grades for medical school. Fuck my university's grade deflation. And with how competitive this fucking place is, how the fuck am I supposed to find an internship. Im fucking dumb. I dont know anything. There are probably 100+ other students who are way smarter and know way more than I do. Why the fuck did I come here for the clout. I shouldve just gone to a smaller school and massage my big fat ego and maybe have a better chance at medical school.

Sorry for the long rant. And sorry for all the bitching and moaning. I know I've got it way better than a lot of people given the pandemic and I feel bad for bitching about my privileged life."

I want to be there for people, help them and do something but my dreams shattered. . I have been suffering from hypersomnia for like 5 6 months now. It came suddenly out of the blue one day and never really went away, I don't remember being this sleepy person. No matter how much I sleep I'm always feeling like I have not slept for 2 days and it sucks, my eyes feel like a burden and it's like I want to leave everything and just sleep. Also when I wake up I'm sweating and feeling very cold. I feel goosebumps, idk why. I feel like closing my eyes and just lay down. It's the worst feeling ever. That pain is indescribable.

 

My mom said you're on your own, I ain't doing anything for this because this is not a disease, you are just lazy. I sleep for 7 8 or more but I'm still feeling the same. I'm not able to do anything, I can't walk or study because I feel sleepy.


 I went to a psychiatrist and he gave me medication but I don't think anything happened. I feel like ending my life because everyone is living their life to the fullest and I'm dying. In between I felt good for 2 3 days, it was like I had control over my damn sleep but then again it became worse.


 I'm very hopeless at this point because I don't have anywhere to go. I think if I end this all it'll be okay because everyone's sayin this fucking disease has no cure or medicine. And that moda drug is dangerous and develops resistance over time. Maybe this is my destiny.  Maybe life isn't for everyone mates. :"") I'm so depressed I can't explain in words. My mom hates me. I got no friends. And now this. I had plans for myself but this hypersomnia ruined everything


I'm not able to keep my eyes open even for 5 minutes.

It's been 6 months and this sleepiness is getting worse day by day.


I went to my mom and begged for help and she said that I'm garbage and it would've been better if she had killed me before I was born. She's saying go out in winter and catch pneumonia so you could get treated then she said kill yourself. I'm 20 but I don't know where to go. I can't even leave the house because I have Hypersomnia..

My chest is so heavy, I wanna cry. I am crying right now while typing this because I don't know where to go.My heart breaks seeing myself like this."

I’ve been abused since childhood by my mother, and although our relationship has gotten better the effects of that still haunt me to this day. It’s not completely good, as I have admitted to her once before that I’ve been feeling suicidal and her response was the beat me instead for being abnormal. I have friends and family, but they don’t really know the things I’ve really been through because I’ve just felt like I would be judged so heavily. The people I have opened up to in the past have just abandoned me or used it against me. I was violated last year and publicly humiliated by the guy that did it, and it’s my fault that I put myself in that situation. For years, I’ve been just feeling pain and trying to fight through it but it’s just been so hard and I’ve reached my breaking point. I hate burdening the people around me and I appreciate the ones that have been trying to help but I simply just can’t take it anymore.

My mother abandoned me when I was young, my father is an emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive alcoholic. I moved out of my dads right when I turned 18. I still see him when I’m home from college on holidays, but as time passes I find myself more and more unable to be around him or even in the same house. This past week I was at his house for Christmas, and every night I spent there I could barely sleep if at all. I barely eat or sleep anymore generally, but combined with my first personal experiences with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (which run on both sides of my family very heavily) has made this past week especially hard. I locked myself in my room everyday this week cause I thought my dad was going to come into my room and murder me, even though he had done nothing and was asleep in bed. I am terrified of him and can’t be around him without losing my mind. My just saw my mother per my grandmas request for the first time in 10 years this week as well and afterwards I just felt numb. I don’t feel like anyone cares about me. I have a good number of friends but I feel like either they all secretly hate me or that they are all dangerous sociopaths. I don’t want to be around anyone anymore. I cry every night in bed now, sometimes to sleep if I can get any. I have siblings but the only one I relate to is my older sister, but I really don’t even know how much she’d care if I was gone. I really don’t think anyone would care. I feel worthless and like my life has just been a huge headache and waste of time. I’m not urgently considering it but I just don’t know what to do. I am researching therapists right now but it’s hard to see the point. I don’t know what happened either, 2 years ago I seemed to have all my mental and emotional ducks in a row but over the past year it’s gotten worse than I even thought it could. I don’t know what the hell im even doing anymore."

I feel stupid for not figuring it out sooner... It coincides with months or weeks where the sadness and pain become unbearable and I cry myself to sleep each night... Each morning... Each day.

Tears... I can't even have tears anymore without causing myself additional pain.

I'm so tired of this cruel joke life has become. I could (""handle"") or somewhat manage the depression, the anxiety, the memories... But mixed with the physical pains for sometime now, it's like my brain is constantly on fire, sensory overload from numerous physical ailments, mixed with both physical and emotional traumas.

But hey, I'm here now... I've made it this far... I'll keep trying until I truly can't absolutely bare anymore. I think that's all I really owe myself. Is to try and give it my all, because fuck what others think... If I can make it... Still have some small victories... Than I'll keep trying.

I've been coming to this thread for many months off and on. Many times it gives me levity, other times it reminds me of my youth and what it was like to be in the immediate moment of some of the most horrible things imaginable and how self destructive those things made me early in life and how it haunted me later in life.

We often think we've processed things, that we really haven't. One of the best things you can due for yourself is talk to someone. Even if the first person you tell brushes you off or rejects you or has no empathy... Keep trying to find help and someone to talk to. It's incredibly hard to self advocate at times, but I I wish when I was in my teens and 20s I talked more with therapists and psychologists so that I could better manage things in life as they took turns for the worse, instead of better. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, until you are your own worst enemy and kill yourself.

This is all I'm able to squeeze out my brain through the pain right now. Brief points of clarity.

May you all find 2021 a little brighter."

kmyiz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kmyiz7/fantasizing/,Fantasizing,3,2,1609317219.0,"I'm 29 next month. I've been out in the world but ptsd triggers or anxiety always kept me from holding down a job. The love of my life left me after 7 years on Dec 4th. I loved one man during my twenties and I wanted to get married. He told me he doesn't want to be more than friends anymore. He's my soul. I love him so much that I don't want to exist on this planet if he's not in my life. I don't want to recover I don't want to move on I don't want to keep going.
If he was the first significant relationship in my life to vioenetly and suddenly end I could keep my head up, but two of my best friends left me after a few years. I was a jerk, depression and anxiety and cyclythmia (bipolar III) make a person fucking difficult.
I love with my abusive father who has inflicted verbal, emotional, sexual, and physical abuse on me. Including hooking me on opioids. I'm sober six months, but I feel worse than ever. 
I feel financially helpless which is a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone. 
I feel much better on Prozac and Zyprexa, but Prozac started to give me painful seizures that made me cry out to fucking God and the Zyprexa is the only antipsychotic that ever worked for me but I refuse to get a movement disorder. 
I had a beautiful life in 2014-2016. If I died now I'd be basically okay with it due to this time in my life. I got love I got acceptance, I got everything I ever wanted. It was the best time of my entire life. I drank carefully then, I had my wonderful boyfriend who was deeply in love with me, I had so many cool friends, I was going to school and was around people who were into the same stuff as me all the time. I had an easy but high paying job with coworkers I loved. 

I was basically okay, but I struggled a bit in school with long term planning and organization. I couldn't finish the final project, so I decided to call a psychiatrist. He gave me lithium, and it worked at first but then after a month it began to slowly give me psychosis but I didn't know what was happening to me until I had a full blown meltdown and got rid of all my furniture and thought I was eating bugs. I stopped eating and started drinking every day, so my dad told me to move back home. 
I slept for a year and survived on alcohol and slim fast. I didn't want to die yet but I was bad off. My dad bought me booze and gave me opioids to help me cope. Did not help. 
I got addicted. 

In 2019, I had finally started to feel normal again. Then covid hit in 2020 and the past years isolating were added to the isolation of this year but worse.
When I speak to anyone, my brain turns to a pile of psychedelic goo and it's difficult to tell where I end and they begin and I feel really creepy. I just feel like I come off as basically cool but I make myself very nervous because I don't know if I'll be stable tomorrow. I'm exhausted from going up and down and feeling like I'm lost in this weird soup. It's hard to explain so don't worry if it sounds too esoteric.
I don't think I have gotten the best diagnosis yet, because on antipsychotics I thought better. It was easier to think clearly, and I read and wrote and understood more better. I'm smart, but didn't know it because I had some kind of thing that made it hard for me to learn as well as others it seemed like. 
But I know now that I'm smart, and love to learn, and now I feel like I'm trying to walk on a broken leg when I try to read. It's the most depressing thing to feel like the person you love is trapped inside of you, trapped by mental illness. 
I just want to get the hell out of this prison. 

I don't think it's that sad in my case. 
I do love to sing, and I will feel guilty for ending the song inside my heart so to speak. 
But the things I love about myself make me angry. It makes me angry that this beautiful person I've always wanted to be and deserved to be is trapped in this fucking defective meat sack. 
Maybe I do need to be grateful for what I do have. Maybe I need to be okay with the quality of life I'm capable of, even if it's not very good. 
Maybe I need to kill myself."

She had a heart attack once and didn’t even know it. She has high blood pressure and breathing problems. Yet she smokes. That doesn’t help. I don’t wanna make her feel bad or judge her. Smoking is an addiction. She is the best person I know. I’ve never really had any friends. I’m lonely. I love my family. I love my siblings so much and I’m really close to them. But it’s not the same. My dad is strange. He acts crazy and switches personality all the time. He was an alcoholic and has physically fought my mom multiple times. (Even when she was pregnant). He’s been to jail for it and doesn’t physically hurt as much anymore. He still has a few times though. He says horrible things to her and I hate him for it. I feel like he hates me more that my other siblings. Me and my brother. I don’t know why but he always chooses us to cuss and loves the others more. He made fun of my brother for painting his nails. He calls him horrible names and used to say that he wasn’t his son. (He is). My brother is only 12 and has the biggest heart. He deserves better than that. He’s said that I wasn’t his too and sometimes I wish I wasn’t. He says I’m lazy and stupid. I cut my hair before and he made fun of me and told me I look like a dy*ke. (Nothing wrong with being lesbian but he was being a homophobic ass). My mom always makes me feel better and it sounds lame but she’s truly my best friend. I love her more than myself and I couldn’t live without her. She’s my everything. I can’t imagine the day something happens to her. I’ve even thought about killing myself before anything happens to her just so I don’t have to see her like that. But I don’t want to hurt her. That would tear her apart and she’s lost so much. She deserves better than that. I don’t want to do that to my brother and sisters or even to my dogs. They don’t deserve that. But I truly can’t imagine ever living a good life without her in it.

He makes me happy and helped me go through a lot of problems as he helped me to go over a lot of insecurities and always respects what I feel and when I don't feel fine; he's just me but happier, just a really bright and gentle guy who genuinely loves me... But I can't stop thinking about suicide.

I can't move on from the idea of killing myself, it is so tiring and sad to... Not be able to think about a life with him or feeling guilt because he's giving me all his love, and... I just want to kill myself? I can't handle this anymore.

And... I'm not killing myself. I'm not strong enough and I would feel even worse because I'll just end up crying in the floor in agony after failing, so... I'm not doing it. 

But things are just... I don't know. I don't know what to do. I love him and we have even talked about having kids and getting married, and getting a house! And it is cute, and I love it, because this is the first time I've ever thought about living more than 20 years, it is the first time I feel prettier, this is the first time I have ever done anything good for myself... And the first time I feel I'm important to somebody.

But... I. Just. Want. To. Kill. Myself. 

I mean, I don't really want to, I wish I was a happy christian in a normal family, with normal or at least real problems beyond this obsession. 

And... Yes, for me it is an obsession as I have been thinking about it for the last 4 years, and it feels horrible wanting to go forward but it is like your mind don't support that, like you know you can blindly feel happy and even if life is senseless... Yeah! It could be okay, you can give a senseless sense to it; this is something I didn't understood before I met him.  

I don't want to die, I swear.

But... My subconscious wants to; it is already dead. I just feel the diary need to die, I just need to die to get better, this is my only way out... BUT I'M NOT DOING IT. 

.

I need help. I want help.

My friends have called my parents and have told them things I say. 

They have asked me why do I feel bad. 

Nothing works anymore."

kmwgys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kmwgys/nostalgia/,Nostalgia,2,0,1609308238.0,"  Do you all remember when you were a child. I do, my earliest memories were lonely ones. I would evade my family because it felt like i was meaningless compared to them. I wasn’t anyones real priority though i was probably wrong. My cousin would beat me and to the point of unconsciousness once. All i remember is waking up and I didn’t know what was going on all I knew at that moment was pain. 

  The pain in my head was piercing but dull. It’s a memory i can’t forget. I hated him but my brother loved him. My grandparents loved him. Everyone did. My grandmother told me i should forgive him and i said I did but i never did. Inside I always wished he would die. 

   Today the pain still creeps up on me but it’s not physical anymore. It’s like white noise that interferes with my thinking. Always there. It gets louder sometimes. So loud my mind cant focus on anything.

   What makes a child deserving of something like that? The child never asked to be born. Why does anyone have to endure constant pain and loneliness? Is it for others? So they wont have to be sad about their departure? Will someone ever want damaged goods? 

  Obviously no. When someone buys a new shirt they want one with no holes or tears. No one buys spoiled fruit.

We have so many barrier infront of us, and yet we can't even cross them without a miracle.

Every problem we have is able to be fixed by those in high positions of power, since they are the ones perpetuating and prolonging them..

But they don't want to fix anything..

Nothing.

What would be better.

Watching the world burn.

Or commit suicide before the pain sets in.

I leave and my loved ones mourn for a while and then go on with their lives.

Its a lose lose situation.

This world is doomed..

We can't do anything, because those above us don't do anything..

Its just the end.

There is no future.

I dont get to become a success artist/animator.

Ill never wake up to see my significant other's smile.

Ill never be able to see my child's face.

Ill never experience old age.

Ill never experience natural death.

Its not possible anymore..

Planting trees doesn't fucking help anymore..

My broken and deeply depressed brain is going to die along with this world..

It just feels so, sad.

It lines up well with my plans to kill myself in a few years..

My failure of a life and my failure of an existence will finally end.

And the world will be better for a moment..

And then forget me.

Just as I was supposed to be..

Never acknowledged.

My birth was a mistake.

My conception wasn't supposed to happen..

I was an accident.

I dont deserve a life.

I deserve to be killed"

kmvxtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kmvxtn/im_struggling_to_hold_it_together_yet_again/,I’m struggling to hold it together yet again,2,1,1609306163.0,"I posted here a few months back and things thankfully improved somewhat. But I feel like I’ve taken 10 steps back once again. 

I was so amped up for the holidays. I hadn’t celebrated Christmas since 2018 and was excited. Christmas Eve I had so much fun with my mom and my boyfriend. Christmas morning was alright. 

But after opening the gifts with my boyfriend, my head just went south. I went to lay down and didn’t get up for hours. It’s like all my energy and what Christmas spirit I had just plummeted. I thought it would be a happy turning point for 2020 but it’s like my head just decided, “no. Be sad. You know this isn’t what you wanted. You know it’s just another day. You know nothing matters anyway.” 

The day after I held it together reasonably well to spend the day after Christmas with my boyfriend and his family, but I felt miserable and sad inside. I don’t know them very well and the entire time I was a quiet, anxious mess. Truthfully, I didn’t want to go. I didn’t feel ready to meet my boyfriends sister and her fiancé. I felt like staying home and crying but I didn’t. We had fun playing a card game. But then that night I was back home and felt just overwhelmingly sad again. I refused sex because I clearly can’t be in the mood when depressed as hell. On Sunday after I worked my morning shift for a cal center from home and my boyfriend went home, I spent all night crying. 

My birthday is Saturday and I feel directionless. I’ll be 26 and feel like I’ve accomplished so little. I feel like I can’t get away because of my personal responsibilities to my pets but wish I could just be alone for a few days. But at the same time I truly believe if I were alone for too long lately, I’d finally commit. Most days lately I feel like the only things keeping me tethered here are the fact my mom would be devastated and my boyfriend of almost 1 year would be sad for a while. I feel like my head is constantly under water and I can never make any momentum in life without being thrown 10 steps backward. I wish I could be on antidepressants again but I’ll be losing my insurance on my birthday as that’s the cutoff for being on my moms, who was generous enough to put me back on it when I lost my job due to Covid in March. 

I simply don’t know what to do anymore and wish I could just end it all. I know of/when Covid is gone my life will never be the same. I cant handle how socially isolated I am lately and continue going back and forth between missing my friends amd people terribly and wishing I could surround myself with people again to just wanting to be alone. Craving being alone. Wishing more than anything that I could self-isolate and give up my responsibilities and not have to speak to anyone. 

If you read this far thank you for caring. It means so much to me as I feel like I have no one I can talk to about this."

When I was a kid, I found things to cling to, so that I would never do it. A quote from a book, the cuteness of a puppy, the taste of my favorite food, the fear of the afterlife. It kept me going for 23 years. I felt safe from myself. 

This year has torn me apart. I have always been optimistic. There is a piece of my childlike innocence and joy that has stayed intact, through all the hardships life has thrown at me. I felt like I could endure anything. That I could defy the world and keep a part of me pure. My hope and endless love to give has kept me going. But it's not intact anymore. I feel pieces of who I am dying, being taken from me. At first, I thought it was just me finally growing up, like the world has to take that part away from me for me to be an adult and truly live. 

It feels more sinister and dark now. I gave myself a year to follow my heart, to take risks, damn the consequences. No risk, no reward, right? I did everything I should have. I did everything I needed to. I just wanted a light at the end of the tunnel. I wanted just a glimmer of hope. It seems silly to put so much into New Year's. It's just another day, right? But I used to care so much. I used to feel uncontainable joy and excitement. No matter what I was going through, I could always just focus on the little things in my future that would bring me joy. They would keep me going. Now I'm realizing, I can't do that anymore.  

It brings me to the question, is life worth living if who you are dies? There are small, but unique parts that make me who I am. They have been sacred to me. For the first time, I'm losing them. I can't hold on anymore. As much as I have struggled and hurt over this year, I have held back from this. I haven't posted here. I haven't planned anything out. Never wrote a note. Didn't check myself into a psych ward. Didn't call the hotline. Nothing. 

That has officially changed. I just finished writing a goodbye. It felt good. I don't know what tomorrow brings or if I will see another year. For the first time, I really don't know. That scares me more than anything. 

I think I just wanted to say that. I can't say this to anyone I know. My family and friends don't know this part of me. My partner is the only one who knows and he's grown tired of hearing it. 

I hope I don't wake up. Every night, I just hope that I never have to wake up again."

I’ve just realised how slightly fucked up it is that I attempted suicide at school when I was 13/14 (I’m 17 now) and how everyone, including me and my family, just brushed over it so quickly. I used to self harm for other peoples entertainment- cutting my wrists and burning my arms. I know it wasn’t really a big deal compared to what other people do and go through but I find it weird how it was all dismissed so quickly, by myself too. 

Was that not a very obvious cry for help or some shit?? 

The worst part is that my friend reported me out of boredom and the sake of “seeing what the school would do”. I thought I had long forgiven her for this but maybe I haven’t?? We were so young and I know we all know better now. I’d say that I and the friends involved would’ve done shit a lot differently now but the worst part is that I still have to listen to jokes about what I did to this day. Like, you weren’t there for me AT ALL when I very obviously needed it but now you’re reaching to joke about it???
Obviously, I shouldn’t have let them but I’ve recently cut them all out anyways (for other reasons).  

Now, I just wish I worked through whatever was wrong with me because I think the lack of closure(?) haunts me to this day. Talking about it somewhere, even online, would’ve been better than doing nothing and just acting perfectly fine until family and whatnot stopped bugging me. The problem is that I’ve practically completely forgotten everything that happened and why I did what I did. I just know that I haven’t changed much and still feel the way I did then. 

Whenever my house is really quiet and all I can hear is the clock ticking, it quite vividly takes me back to sitting on that bed- where I swayed my head and legs to the beat and my finger tapped along. I concentrated really hard on the clock to drown out the conversation about me and get through the situation I put myself in as quick as possible. 
I feel like, since then, I’ve mentally tapped out. I was so focused on making things go back to normal that I may have drowned myself and any sort of genuine emotion or thought out. In short, I’m stuck on autopilot. It feels like I’m a little ghost watching whoever my body is go through each day.

Probably going to get buried, but if anyone comments I’ll be super thankful. I have a few more things to do before I go (reading this book I just got, the graphic novel version of on of my all time favorites, making a funeral playlist for some reason, cleaning my room, writing notes, that sorta thing) but I gotta be gone by the sixth. I’m 26 days clean of sh, will be 27 days clean in half an hour, and it’s be cool to make it to a month. Idk why I wrote all that, just background info I guess.

My main question is how many Kroger brand allergy pills i have to take to kill my self. They’re the kind that make you really tired and just knock you out. I also might be able to get my hands on some clonidine which I take to help me sleep, but my mom keeps the bottle in her room so maybe not. I’m 5 foot 8 inches and weigh about 130 pounds and am 16 years old. Also-also I’ll be able to take a week’s worth of anti depressants (half a small pill of abilify and two small symboltas - sorry if I’m spelling them wrong and I can try to get the exact amount if that’s needed) and about 14 fairly large magnesium tablets. All together that sounds like a lot to me, especially if I can take a whole bottle of the allergy pills.

I’m also planning on slitting my wrists after taking the pills. I tried it before but I think I know what went wrong the last time and will try to do it better this time. I might not even do this if the pills will be enough, but if they aren’t then I want a backup just in case.

Sorry for the long post, I just really want to know what will be enough to kill me. And will drinking alcohol help the process or anything? I’ve heard of people od-ing with pills and alcohol but never knew if that was actually helping or not.

I’m really sorry if I’ve broken he rules in any way, I hope this isn’t too explicit.

Any responses would be greatly appreciated."

I first got depressed when i was about 10, i hated my class, i hated my body, i hated my memories and i hated my parents. I was a fat, depressed, unfunny piece of shit with no meaning of life. So I tried to kill myself, i wanted to jump off a bridge, but i didnt have to balls to do it. 

It only got worse the next couple of years, and when I was 12, I got denied many things.  My first audition to become an actrice, which was fair, but I also failed an audition for a school play and I failed to get into a special english class, both I cared so much for. 

It only became worse when I thought of the future, I was sure I wouldn't get a job  and become a poor piece of shit. So I tried it once more, i came back to the same bridge, climbed over the railing, but I couldn't let go. I thought of my friends and even my family, which has caused me much trauma's.

This schoolyear was even worse, I got called names behind my back and I didn't even trust my friends. The whole year, every day, 24/7, i thought of the trauma's my family gave me. I can't trust my family,  I am too embarrassed to do anything when they are around, they laugh at me and my brother used to hit me everytime i stood up to him. 

I'm seeing a psychiatrist now, but it's not working. I can't go to her when i am feeling sad or lonely, and I sure can't turn to my family. All I want is to feel happy once, just once, i don't want to commit suicide, but if I'm spiraling more, I may just have to.

So, I’m 17 years old atm and ever since I was 9 I’ve been battling the thought of just giving up. I was of course too young then to think about suicide, instead I thought of giving up as “sleeping forever”. I had this idea of a state were I’d feel no happiness but in turn feel no pain, I’d feel nothing. 

As years passed I started to slowly lose myself. Existential questions tormented me until I was 14. At this age I started to understand more. Whatever the reason was for my existence it was an insensitive and cold one I decided. be it randomized evolutions or god, both are equally cruel. 

At 15 everything started to turn grey. I slowly stopped caring. I still had empathy and I still cared for others, but my perception of the world was colder, more calculating and less feelings.

At 16 I got really depressed. This was last year and my school had a lockdown. What kept me going at this point was the few times I spent with friends, people I considered family, people that brought my feelings back to life sort of. Lockdown killed the last I had for 6 months.

I’m now dead inside. I feel nothing. I can watch family members as well as my closest friends get hurt and I’ll still feel nothing. I haven had a genuine smile in what feels like a year. I don’t really know why I keep going at this point? The only time I find myself feeling anything is when I’m close to death, when the adrenaline is kicking. Fear, the sweet taste of fear. Ahhhhh, I could go on and on about how I love the feeling. But I’m not running into near death situations every day am I? Nothing else gets that reaction from me sadly. I’m feeling like I’m getting off the subject, sorry. 

 I don’t know why I’m writing this. Am I looking for support? Help? Am I just writing this so I can finally let go? I don’t really know, but now it’s written. 

Oh and I forgot to mention, I’m male, pretty popular amongst those in the same age. I have a loving family and I have no real reason to feel this way. I just do."

I am new to Reddit. I found this forum by surprise while browsing for help for my boyfriend.  
But first let me explain my situation. So, I am a 25 year old girl from Norway who moved to the US a few years ago for university. I am working here now and will continue to stay here. I have a very good job, a great boyfriend and I enjoy my life here in the US.

I met my boyfriend 2 years ago. He is in his second year of medical residency here in the US. He is 27 years old, and also an immigrant like me. He is German-Persian, but grew up in Germany and Switzerland. He is a really great man and also a great surgeon. I am a shy girl and it took a lot of time until we came together. The thing I love about him the most, is that he is super ""positive"" and always builds me up. He pushes me and because of him I have become so much more confident. He loves me and supports me in all aspect of life. He makes me feel special and I love him with all my heart. 

However, he has always had a different side. There are moments when he is really sad. He never tells me why and always pretends to be happy. But I know that something is deeply wrong. When I am not at our apartment, he just sleeps, does not do anything. I also saw him googling information on suicide and methods etc. He is doing great at work. He is a surgeon and belongs to the best of his year. His dream was always to move to the US and work in an elite uni program. He made it and everything appears fine.  
When I talk with him and confront him , he always says that he is fine etc. He tells me that he loves me and that all is okay. We even have sex and everything feels normal. I do not know how to elaborate this properly, but I just know that something is wrong. Sometimes, I feel like he is about to cry, but he is always holding back.  

Do you have any idea what I should do and what really is going on? I feel helpless."

I wish I could open up to friends more. It's difficult though because you don't want to burden them. It feels like my life is one sick joke. Or maybe I'm being punished for something. Maybe it's both. I know I'm a piece of shit anyway. Further I fall into this cave of generational trauma and curses. The only good is that I know I won't be responsible for passing down more trauma."

Not that I’m complaining; I just feel I’m one of those people who didn’t get that good hand. And that’s okay. I had an okay one for a while, laughed, and even enjoyed a lot of it when I was young. I’m okay with things being at the finale point. I wish I had more of a drive to want to feel better; but it’s been 7 years trying to figure this all out.

Our age difference made it so that I marveled at your feet, I both loved and worshipped you despite your apparent lack of interest in me. As I grew you only showed interest in me when I was useful to you, “sissy do this” “sissy do that” and I would do it because how could I not, that was love was it not? Obedience. 

When we were joined by yet another, I wanted to protect it from you, I loved you but by then I knew your love was cruel and manipulative, I wanted to be for them what you had never been for me and at the same time I wanted to be for you whatever you wanted me to be, because I wanted you to love me back.

As years passed you merely became more difficult to please, I could never anticipate a sunny day, or one filled with rage. I stupidly became your confidante even though with our age difference it was completely inappropriate the things you said to me, things I did not understand but scared me. I grew into a person you did not like; not because I was a bad person, but rather because I became a person someone could love despite you. You hated the love others gave me, the protection they tried to give me against you. You tried so hard to shape my life into one you found acceptable despite my being miserable for it. You used your benevolence against us, reminding us of every penny that you had given in exchange for our love, but never considering all the malevolence that had subjugated us at your feet, how could you anticipate the years of bitterness and resentment that had been building up in us when you had never cared about humiliating us? To you that was just your right.

Then the dark days came my way, and I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, fearing all evil because no one was with me. When we talked you never listened, and I had to crawl my way out of abuse and suicide alone, yet my suffering was never enough for you, it did not merit to the level of yours because by the time you learned of it I was already out, I was stronger than you and I saw you more clearly than ever, but still, I loved you.

And then I met him, despite you despising my happiness, failing to understand our bond, and trying to manipulate me back to you it was the first time I said enough. Yet STILL I made excuses for you, to keep you next to me, when you were down, I was down there with you, letting you use me as a ladder. I wanted you to join us in the land of the living, but you kept throwing yourself down.

I cannot do it anymore; I am just as tired as you are. You refuse to understand that the laws you live by are restraining and cruel, that none of us wish to bow at your feet anymore. That we have found peace in our own way. Yet you tell me of the many ways you plan to kill yourself, telling me nothing has significance and now I believe you, we have no meaning to you happy, we are useless if you cannot use us as one would a jacket over a puddle. I understand now that you do not love us, you have never loved us, 30 years later and I have finally understood the toxic hold you had over us. 

If or when you die, I will be mutilated, I will blame myself and I will be shattered. Life will never be the same for me because you will always be missing. Remembering the few good days will be crushing and remembering all the bad days will fill me with rage.

Originally I made this account to tell someone my thoughts without actually having to see them, as you can see in the post history. It did help a bit, and I found out that expressing myself in ""sketches"",memes or these kind of posts does help.

To recap my previous posts, I tried attempting suicide 3 ish years ago when I was 16 due to a abusive/horrible mother with a father absent due to divorce, sadly I was unsuccessful but I moved away and took control of my life as I made friends, hobbies and worked out, grades were decent too I guess.

However, the past 3 years I had episodes every day, hallucinations, voices, break downs, mood swings, self harm to being frequently on the verge of suicide, with absolutely no reason.

Atleast 3 years ago I knew why I wanted to kill myself, but now i know nothing. Honestly it's getting to me lately, as recently I wrote a suicide letter and started researching on effective methods, and I'm becoming more and more unstable every day, one day it's going to happen and I hope soon tbh.

I mean, what do I lose? My friends obviously hate me (logically speaking this isn't true but thats how I constantly feel), I have nobody close except a best friend, but to be honest I started distancing myself, and maybe that's the way to make it less painless for all. Just isolate, let them forget me and do it. I uh don't know at the point. It's a nightmare, it just hurts living without a reason.

I just want someone to come to me, give me a hug and say ""it's ok"". But nobody will do that, cause no one knows how serious situation I am in. Nobody knows about the fact that right now I'm on the roof, on the edge specifically ready to jump off to the electric pole a few meters below.

I want help, but nobody seems to be able to help, not even the psychiatrist.


I don't know anymore

kmp92t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kmp92t/do_i_share_that_his_death_was_a_suicide_with/,DO I SHARE THAT HIS DEATH WAS A SUICIDE WITH OTHERS WHO THINK IT WAS DUE TO SOMETHING ELSE?,6,5,1609283088.0,"My brother died this month. He was relatively young, and he had a history of cardiac illness--he literally died and was resuscitated at least once before. Based on this, and the fact that he was found on the floor of his room, naked, with a big lump on his forehead, it looked very much like he died from another cardiac arrest, and collapsed where he stood (resulting in the bump on the forehead). His obituary stated that he passed from ""presumed cardiac arrest after a long battle with cardiac illness.""

However, after his funeral, I received the Medical Examiner's report: It was not cardiac arrest. It was a suicide. Toxicology reports showed he swallowed a bunch of his prescription pills.

Of course, I was devastated by this news, and harbor horrible feelings of guilt--my brother struggled with mental illness and addictions, and I had given him so much money over the years to bail him out of one mess or another, and I had finally cut that off in recent months and gotten him state assistance instead. The state put him up in temp housing and gave him connections to food and medical transportation and medical services. He had no money, but all his basics were tended to, and a neuro-psych evaluation was ordered up (he never made it to that appt, which was set 3 months out).

My current struggle is that, now that I've received this news, I feel a strange urge to guard this information. I don't think I want the world to know he died of suicide. I feel like I'm protecting his reputation. I'm not sure how rational that is, but we started that narrative about cardiac arrest based on educated assumptions, and I'm reticent to pull that back to tell how he really died. I've told a few very close people, but no more. My brother had 2-3 close friends that really cared about him, and I feel I should tell them, but in the next breath wonder if it really is necessary. Am I serving anything by telling them? On the one hand, I feel like it would help to unburden me--it would help to share this with someone who knew him and understands. But am I just transferring my grief to someone else? I know they'd WANT to know, but I'm not at all sure how much pain this would then bring to them. I already told one friend of his and I don't think he took it well. The other two probably wouldn't take it so hard, and I think they'd want to know, but maybe it's just me wanting to unload. I'm VERY torn.

One of my friends I told this info to asked me if possibly the reason I'm protective of the suicide info is that I'm actually wanting to protect myself, given the guilt for his suicide. Initially I was adamant it was HIM I was trying to protect...his legacy. But maybe there's some truth to it? I dunno...I'm not thinking clearly these days anymore. Which is why I'm here. In your opinion, do you feel I should be more open with the rest of the world about his cause of death?"

If you can, please, please just share any advice that you can. I'm so scared for my friend and I REALLY need advice on what to do.

My best online friend has depression. Recently he's gone on break from all social media; he did this because he was getting stressed out by everything with our friend group, his school work, etc. However he's still been messaging me, telling me that he still feels incredibly depressed. I have been diagnosed with depression, and have went to the hospital for a week after self-harming and planning to commit suicide. I'm a bit better now, but he has had no help whatsoever.

The issue is that he lives in Turkey, and I live in America. He's explained to me that mental health isn't really regarded as much over there, or paid much attention to. He's talked to his school counselor, she ignored him. He talked to his parents, they didn't listen. I've pestered him to try and convince his parents to just listen, because that's how I got help (I had told my mom that I was considering suicide; that's a whole 'nother story of it's own), but he's stubborn and doesn't think it'll work no matter how much I try to talk to him.

He doesn't have a history of cutting or anything like that, but he self harms by drinking coffee with absurd amounts of sugar to speed up his heart rate. He says that this makes him feel like he's going to die, and I'm no medical expert but I'm sure it's not helpful for him whatsoever. He mentions quite a bit that he'd kill himself but he can't because he's afraid of leaving everyone behind. Still, it scares me to no end.

I can't bare the thought of losing him. He's so behind in school, every day is just another day of pain he has to go through. I'm terrified he's just going to disappear one day, because every day he just seems to get worse. Every day I've talked to him and tried to give him advice, he gets better for a while then gets bad again.

I'm desperate here. Please, I need advice."

I can’t be hospitalized, I’d lose my job, car, and apartment. So I don’t really have a middle ground. It’s either or. People just walk out of my life, I haven’t had one person in my life I can call a true friend. People tell me I’m too negative, or just ghost me. I have people I’ve bent over backwards to help, but when I need help they’re nowhere to be found. My only solid support in my life is my therapist. My dads distant, thinks everything in life is good, and my mom is a manipulative narcissist. My youngest brother means everything to me, and all I can think about is how bad it will hurt him, and how alone he will be when I’m gone. I just can’t keep living feeling like this.

I've been depressed almost my entire life. I've been wanting to be dead for a long time. I'm in a loving relationship but there are times when I don't know what I've done wrong to get yelled at. I've been yelled at my entire life so I know I should just get used to being yelled at and I should never yell back. I know I'm too old to cry and I'm too old to have meltdowns. I hate how immature I am. I wish that I can handle getting yelled at just like everyone else can. I'm such a brat for wanting more than what I have in life. I don't think I should be in relationships anymore since I can't handle them. I'm always doing something wrong and I'm too stupid to figure it out. I get yelled at if I ask what I did wrong. I know I'm supposed to be smart enough to know what I did wrong but sometimes in the morning, the first thing that happens is that I'm yelled at and my stupid brain decides right then and there to enter a state of panic and I immediately have meltdown. I don't mean to but I'm scared and I'm trying to stop freaking out over nothing and I even bite myself to get myself to scream over a real reason. I should scream and cry if I'm actually hurt. Words aren't supposed to hurt me. I'm just a big crybaby so I hurt myself to give myself a real reason to cry. Sometimes I'm so upset because the yelling won't stop so I started screaming about how I want to die how I want to die and I keep hurting myself so I can shut up and stop screaming so much. My SO tells me that if I say that I want to die so much then that means that I don't love them. I do love them. I love them more than I love anyone else. I keep telling them that I love them more than my own life and I want to make them happy. Is it true? Is it true that if I really want to die it's because I don't love them? Have I been lying this whole time? I hate liars and I don't want to be a liar. If it's true that by wanting to be dead that I don't love my SO, should I leave them? Should I end the relationship so that I can stop being such a horrible liar? I think I love them but maybe I don't because I wish I was dead. I feel like there is no saving me. I feel like I am worthless and hopeless. I feel like I can't be fixed. I don't know what to do anymore. Anytime I ask my SO about my feelings I'm told that I don't love them. I'm being selfish by wishing they would just make my feelings about me for once. I even apologized for being a P.O.S. and they said they accepted my apology. I wish they had told me that I wasn't a P.O.S. but I must be that. I do scream and cry a lot even though I don't want to. I'm too much of a coward to actually cut myself but I want to one day have the strength to stop being such a coward and just cut myself instead of biting myself. I also hope one day I can beat my head in just right so I can change my personality so I can stop crying all the time. I have never been able to change myself no matter how hard I've tried. I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I don't know how to change myself. I wish that there was a drug that I could take so that I can finally become a good person who doesn't cry and isn't such a selfish brat. Every time a doctor gives me meds I can't stop crying and I can't stop being depressed."

I feel tired all day, the past week I suspect it's because I've been on a course of antibiotics which hasn't helped. My dissertation is due in like 5 days and I haven't finished yet, I haven't had any drafts marked because I didn't feel like I had any worth submitting, they were due like two months ago and it's too late to ask for any feedback from my supervisor now.

kmn7w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kmn7w7/im_so_tired_of_my_life_and_i_want_to_stop/,I'm so tired of my life and i want to stop existing. (long vent ahead),4,1,1609276735.0,"Before any of you guys think this is a really dumb reason to want to kill yourself, yeah, I know. I'm 16 years old and i have ADD, horrible anxiety and lately I've been in a deep depression. I'd like to think im oversensitive and easily impressionable and I care too much about what others think of me. It doesn't help that i pretty much only have 2 friends and due to my own insecurities and guilt I've distanced myself from my internet friends that i used to be so close to. 

All these thoughts racing through my mind is making it so tiring to exist, Christmas break is almost over and im afraid i won't be able to take it anymore once online school starts up again. My house feels broken, i live in a middle class neighborhood so i feel entitled for mentioning this but our house is the only one on the street that looks scuffed. The blinds in my bedroom thats at the front of my house broke off, leaving me with sheer curtains to protect myself from people looking in, the trees and bushes infront of my house have become overgrown because nobody ever bothered to trim them for the 8 years weve lived here, the screen door leading to the back porch has so many holes in it from when  my cat was a kitten that i taped up when i was like 7 and our dishwasher door is fucked and many more things. I feel like a cunt for being insecure about this because i cant do anything about it (just turned 16, no job no money, im useless lol) and at least i live in a house,,, all this plus me being an introvert and  never really leaving my house probably makes me the weirdo kid of the neighborhood.

On to whats been fucking with me more recently, ive been in a really vulnerable state for a couple weeks (or more i cant remember). I'm constantly remembering how much of a huge fucking bully i was in elementary school and dealing with self destructive thoughts constantly. Honestly i don't feel like i deserve friends or a s/o because of how disgusting and horrible i was, i keep having to remind myself that i changed and im not like that anymore, then i do or say shit impulsively or i overthink for a little too longer and then im back in this loop of destructive thoughts. Social media isn't helping either, i have an obsession with twitter thats taking a toll on my emotional state but i cant get off it. This is such a dumb thing to stress over but I've been a fan of minecraft youtubers for a looooong time (cringe i know) and due to my add i get attached to their content easily which is called a ""hyperfixation"". I acknowledge that some of the youtubers i watch are problematic (or have done/said problematic things) and it's a hard pill to swallow, but i have to deal with it (trust me when i watch someone for a long time and i get attached to their content and no matter how much i want to its really hard to fall out of it), but logging onto twitter and other social media to be met with constant criticism and hatred towards my favorite things literally makes me feel like throwing up sometimes and i can't seperate myself from it. I guess the whole caring too much about what others think of me plays into this and i go through mental gymnastics every day because i don't know if im morally wrong for enjoying these people and their content. I swear it's deeper than this but I'm not good with words,  i dont want to fucking kill myself because teens on twitter are mad at block game youtubers, but it's part of the racing thoughts that go through my head that makes living so exhausting.

There's way more to it but like i said I'm not good with words, I'm just saying the stuff that i can actually say with words. I want to stop existing but I'm afraid of dying, I just know if i was given the opportunity to dissapear I'd take it without thinking. Honestly the thought of isolating myself completely and ruining all my relationships so I don't have to worry about this stuff anymore sounds so nice but i love my friends and family and i wouldn't want to hurt them. Its just that upholding relationships right now is super exhausting and I'm already horrible at communicating. Thanks for listening if u read through this <3"

It upsets me that even though I graduated with honors, have great friends and family, have a stable job, etc and still feel so unhappy. Some have said that I basically am sad for no reason. I’ve felt this way for a long time now and I thought as I grew and with therapy it would fade away. 

Every time I get in my car, i hope that someone is careless and causes me to be in a fatal accident. That way my family wouldn’t be ashamed since it wasn’t done from my own hands...

kmmcbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kmmcbm/im_exhausted/,im exhausted,1,0,1609274064.0,"hello, 

my name is, let’s say M. I think it’s pretty. im 18 years old and at the moment I’m going through the worst phase of my life. now, you might be thinking, ‘oh another teenager claiming to have a terrible life, what’s new’ and maybe I am. maybe I’m making a huge deal out of nothing and I’m just an ungrateful bitch who’s doing totally fine. it doesn’t feel that way at all though. 

my parents never paid attention to me my whole life. i have a twin brother who basked in all the love and attention and affection while I had to watch and be told how much of a burden I am and how I can’t do anything right and how everything would be easier without me. my brother used to be my everything. he was my hero, my best friend. but I’ve recently realized how much of a manipulative asshole he is and how he always looked out for himself all our lives and claimed to love me but never did anything to help me out when my father was beating the shit out of me or my mother was tormenting me by yelling about how she wishes I was never born. suffice to say, he’s not my hero anymore. they don’t exist. 

my father has an anger problem that comes out only around me. on multiple occasions, he’s gotten physically violent with me. I don’t like to use the word abuse because it gives me a bad feeling in my chest. but it is what it is. my mother is a selfish bitch who cares about only herself and her golden son. she’s amazing at 2 things. shopping and ripping my minimum self confidence to shreds by her words and sometimes scaring me into panic attacks. very talented woman (note the sarcasm). 

not a fairytale childhood or home life. never got attention. desperately crave it now, to the point where I sometimes go to extremes to get it. extremes that sometimes do get dangerous and bad for me. 

let’s talk about me for bit. i have intense internal rebellious streaks that never got expressed and come out at the worst times in the worst ways because of being suppressed for so long. im incredibly impulsive because of having no freedom my entire life. i write. I read. a whole fucking lot. i paint, draw, sketch, craft, cook, skateboard, ice skate, play badminton and do probably a couple more things that I can’t think of right now. I’m talented. but I feel worthless. every second of the day. it’s like I know I’m a pretty cool person but in my head it doesn’t matter. what use am I when I can’t even make my parents proud. 

I also have a very childish sense of humor sometimes, but I’m extremely witty and charming when I’m in the right headspace. I can be very funny when I’m trying to ignore internal struggles, I’m very stubborn at times about the tiniest things, and I have very all of the place moods. 

I have a little sister who’s 6 years old. my angel. I love her to bits and pieces and want to dedicate my entire life into protecting her and making sure she gets every single thing she deserves. she’s a genius kid. a smartass. bright. funny. charming. she’s my life. 

I’ve been a top student my whole life. I got amazing grades and worked hard as fuck, not be a good student, but to have some sort of validation that I’m not a total failure. i did amazing in school and had hope every single time that maybe today my parents would be proud of me. it got crushed every single time. after a while, I stopped hoping. 

recently, I fucked up my university admission test. not going to go into detail about why and how, I just didn’t do good enough to get into a great university. and the ones I did get into, are too expensive and my parents refuse to pay for it. funny how my brother gets to study in one of the best universities in the country, not because he’s smart, but because my parents paid his way into it, while I don’t even get to go on my on hard work. 

I have extreme trust issues. I got fucked over by a shit ton of people so after a while I never bothered getting close to anyone. I have a handful of surface level friends. and many many people who know me by name. i had one person who I was so incredibly close to, but because I’m a fucking attention seeking psychopath, I made a terrible mistake with him and lost him. I had to listen to him tell me how I totally ruined him and how insane and psychotic I am and what a loser I am, without saying anything back because I actually did make a huge mistake and deserved all of it. I love him. so much. he means more than the world to me. but I don’t deserve him and there’s nothing I can do about it.

I used to have a self harm problem years ago. something I had gotten over but has started back up again due to recent self hating thoughts. It hurts. 

the attention seeking has made me look for approval everywhere. especially from boys. ive become extremely forward when it comes to interacting with guys and get high on the approval I get from them. at the end of the day, I hate myself for that too. 

right now, I don’t have anything. i don’t have an escape. I don’t have people. I don’t have self worth. I don’t have motivation. I don’t have energy. I really really don’t have energy. I do have sleepless nights, terrible nightmares about falling down dark holes, and a bad train of thoughts. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I’m exhausted. 

with love, 
M"

Did I make a mistake?",3,2,1609271636.0,"My ex and I broke up a few weeks ago. We live together, and broke up because she had changed as a person and wanted different things, but there was no animosity and we still got along, so we agreed we both still wanted to be friends and be in each other's live, so we agreed to live together as roommates.

She's suicidal, always has been, not just because we broke up. She has said before that one of the main reasons she hasn't done it is because of her bird, that she raised from a chick for the past 3 years, and is basically her daughter, and she needed to take care of her. A while back she asked me, if one day something happened and she killed herself, if I would take in and care for her bird, I of course said yes. 

Less of a while back I realized that agreeing to that took away a reason for her not to do it because she wouldn't have to worry about taking care of the bird, and I felt like it was a mistake to agree to it. I've wanted to tell her that and take it back for a while now, but never knew how to do so because of how sensitive of a topic it is.

Now today, I clearly had things on my mind, and she was stressing I could talk to her, even about how I felt about her and our breakup, even after I said I shouldn't and couldn't talk to her about it. She got me to talk about it, including about how I was feeling with her still being here and it being harder for me to move on. She then said, I quote, ""I don't know what to do, if I kill myself, then you won't be able to pay the rent here."" I took this to mean that she was thinking about it, like in her head she thought of it as an actual possibility to fix the problem. Scared of the potential aftermath to what she said, I very calmly said, ""I'm sorry, but it something happens to you, I don't want to take of Aria(the bird)."" I said it in the hope it would deter her, but it made her feel worse. She came back after, asking why I was telling her to kill herself. I was confused and I've been apologizing profusely, explaining to her what I was going for and trying to do, and she said it didn't come off that way, regardless of how I meant it. She said it felt like I was treating the bird like a tax to her dying, like I was ok'ing her killing herself but not to peg the bird on me. Looking back now, I understand how she could interpret it that way, it makes sense. 

I've tried explaining more than once and apologizing profusely and she said I really need to think about how I say things, because now whenever she's sad she's going to think back to this. She said I'm fucked in the head, that something is mentally wrong with me. What do I do now? She came back and we apologized to each other, and she said she understands what I was trying to do, but that I have to be more careful about how I say things. I don't know what to do now, it's in her head now and she'll remember this."

When I get up I typically let her sleep because she was working late but she gets up at random times and wants to me pay attention to her and stop what I was previously doing, this has kinda been a hindrance. Im not the best boyfriend to her as I spend most if not all of my free time smoking copious amounts of weed and just playing video games, we have a house and 2 dogs together... I'm also a plumber who hates to even go to work,  but ultimately I think our difference of schedule is what is ruining us, Its tough to do things together while our life is like this.. I said to her that we both need some change in our lives but it seems like it's not going to happen. Any decent advice would be appreciated.

I am currently 16 years old and mere 2 months away from being 17. But I think I might never turn 17 looking at how my life is going and how my studies have turned out so far this year. I am from India, from an upper middle class family, ho has had some general financial struggles and being an average teen I have also had some arguments with my parents. I was a really straight A student in my young years, just as any other kid of my age, but this year turned out to be a lot different. I was always interested in learning new things as was always fond of new concepts of science and math. Being from an Asian family, like any other stereotype my family was always  interested in pushing me towards engineering and that is what i opted for after passing 10th grade, but i never was interested in it. I love art and animation and always wanted to become an animator, like on YouTube and stuff. But i got no support for my choices and i was pushed harder everyday by my parents and as a result i did not score high enough in 11th grade. I scored barely above passing grades in most of the subjects and had to give retests in the ones i failed. But in my final year, this time its board exams and i could not learn anything, even after 10 minutes of studying anything my mind zones out and i feel that i am going to fail no matter how hard i try to concentrate. I cannot study through online lectures, not even a single line. Not only that since i could not continue my work in art, i completely lost my flow in art and my hands no shake every time i try to draw.I even tried to tell this to my mom but she said that I am over-reacting and rather should focus on scoring good marks to get into top colleges. I am now worth no more than an idling pile of laundry who cant decide what to do anymore. I have so many thoughts inside me that I just keep on typing them here, I really want to end it all or just get a restart anyhow. I cannot keep going like this or else it might just be better to end it all."

Like my problems don't stack up to some people out there facing genocide and war. But at some point, you hit a breaking point.

I plan to end my life. Every day I fantasize about escaping the pain. The extreme depression and anxiety. I am just waiting for the day where the concept of death no longer scares me, and that day is inching closer all the time.

I have clinical depression and panic anxiety. I suffer from the beginning stages of fibromyalgia and arthritis. I live in constant pain due to a spinal birth defect. Coincidentally I refuse pain killers because my parents are both addicts. This year alone, they have taken $14,000 from me to fund expenses because they can't stop buying shit. And I don't have a job. That was my unemployment. As a university student all 3 of my jobs were lost with Covid. I just get guilt tripped into it every time and I can't listen to my mother cry and tell her no like that...

I call my parents as some of the closest people in my life. But neither of them accept their gay child. I've fought  for 7 years to convince them its not a phase but don't worry, ""I'll find the right woman eventually."" Hell, when I came out to my mom, she tried to kill herself because she ""couldn't live with her son being gay.""

My father no longer feels like the same person who raised me. He's become blatantly racist, and is horrifying going off the deep end in morality.

Its hard because deep down I know they care. I've watched my mother, even when completely out of her mind due to medication, still try and take care of me as she fell apart. So it fucking hurts to say I feel so detached.

I'm 25. I have not hit any of the milestones associated with being young. Normally I'd say thats okay, but I've never been on a date, had a SO, had the first kiss, anything. Hell, I feel so goddamn ugly and unattractive and fat these days its hard to say I blame anyone for avoiding me. (And yes, I've tried dating apps. Fat chance getting a message on those)

I grew up middle class. Still am since I live at home. But growing up I quickly learned no one really cared about me. Everyone has left. Even as a kid, on 3 seperate instances, 3 of my so called friends tried to choke the life out of me. Of those 3 times, the police were called once.

Even recently I've been assaulted by my psycho neighbor. Broke 2 toes and injured my wrist. The police didn't do anything because his story differed from our version of events. It literally happened on OUR porch, several houses from his. Police said ""Well if he does anything again, call us and hopefully we will get here before he kills you""

I am religious, and I've settled with the idea that God doesn't hate gays. I don't believe that. But I've gotten to the point that he hates me specifically. 

I've gone full nihilism. My life doesn't matter. I'm untalented, useless, and nothing in the universe ultimately matters with the eventual heat death of everything. So my death won't matter here and now either.

My body exists as an autoimmune disorder. Fucked up skin thanks to a bad case of KP, im losing my hair at 25, and as I said, full body pain most of the time. Hell, I shouldn't even be alive. I was ""born"" a month early but I was clinically dead until doctors saved me.

I possess no saving grace. Hell, my best friend in school graduated. We went from talking every day to barely at all, and its not from lack of trying. I feel as though most of the people that call me friend do so out of pity.

I have rebounded through several therapists to no avail. My school transitioned me between several therapists as they hired and let people go. I got tired of starting to explain myself over and over and over and over to new people so I have given up.

There is no hope. Not an ounce of me left wants to live just to continue suffering. I have such a negative self view of myself I won't even look myself in the mirror. I get depressed when I see images of people I like/find attractive. How could I ever think about an idol romantically. The thought of them stooping to my level disgusts me. Hell, I used to be a big fan of BTS, both for music and looks, but I can't listen to them anymore. I took down their posters in my room because I felt so repulsed by having their eyes in me.

I like to say I have a big heart. I love fully, unconditionally, and I am very sweet. I love the little things in life, and im generally a bubbly and happy person towards others... but its getting so hard anymore to fight... just yesterday I self harmed again for the first time in a while.


I plan to end my life. Its only a matter of time. So why am I posting here... A cry for help maybe... for a lost soul who feels the world against him... A gentle, peace loving person who is haunted by immense pain and loneliness... someone with so much love he wants to give but can't seem to find it in myself to love myself back...

Please... I beg the internet... help me save me from myself."

My aunt hasn't talked to me for over a year. She just flat out ignores me everytime I see her. She says nothing to me. All of this started because she was mad that my mom wasn't calling her on a regular basis. So I told her that my mom is a busy person and maybe she should call her instead. She said that I was rude and that I was no longer welcome at her house and that we would not be on speaking terms. So I finally decided to tell her that I no longer want her in my life. She said that what I said was hateful and awful. Then her daughter texted me and basically told me what an awful person I am. I sometimes wonder if they're right. I feel like I've taken a relationship away from my mom and I feel like shit for it. I just feel so vile and disgusting. I know I'm probably better off without them, but their words still hurt. I'm scared that I destroy the good things in people's lives. I think that people's lives would of been better if I had just killed myself a long time ago. Sorry for the long post.

kmi09t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kmi09t/im_lost/,I'm Lost.,4,1,1609260807.0,"I don't know where to begin. Everyday is a struggle. I've repeatedly been making attempts on my life since about December. I tried hanging in the beginning, with little success because it seemed too painful. 6 or 7 times of that made me realize that it wouldn't work. I broke in October, and took 1500 mg of antidepressants, more than 60 times what my dose was, in hopes that I would die. After puking and having severe pain for hours on end and texting everyone I loved, I told my mom, because I thought about my families suffering. I was taken to the hospital, then I was put in a psych ward. My experience there wasn't great, as I saw kids even younger than me, around 12 years old, who had attempted to slit their wrists, and the help they tried to provide, in the form of group therapy, did nothing for me. Not even 2 weeks later, in the early months of November, I accidentally slipped in conversation, and my mom realized I had plans to try to kill myself again. She forced me to go into the hospital, and despite my protest, another psych ward. At this Psych ward, my experience was terrible. We were neglected sufficient water, they stopped doing check ins, and they screamed in a room full of kids with PTSD. They were constantly triggering kids with these severe issues, and the constant yelling has caused me to occasionally shake if I hear loud noises. The workers also stopped doing their check ins at some point, so I would see kids start slitting their wrists with things they stole from the workers, so I had to take it into my own hands to stop them. When I was there, I met people who had been raped, their children beaten to death by their parents, forced to take alchohol, but one stuck out. One girl, who was my same age, 16, had been forced to drink alchohol when she was 2, was beaten by her father, forced into sex slavery, tazed 27 times in a basement as punishment and locked in a basement for 48 hours, intentionally starved, saw her friend get shot at point blank and the blood splattered on her, her brother was shot over $50 of meth, and she resorted to any drug you could think of. She had been stuck in Psych wards, residencies, and foster homes, and none of them could sufficiently do anything. She got in this time for jumping in front of a speeding car, and narrowly avoiding death. I thought she was pretty, but I recognized we were in a psych ward, so I didn't take any action, yet. In our groups she mentioned that she liked weightlifting and playing violin, which were 2 of my favorite things. We started to discuss more and more and found that we had a lot of common things we liked. I completely fell for her at that point, and I told her, and she said she felt the same. From that point on, we held hands and hugged when the workers weren't looking, we fell asleep in the hallway looking at each other from the distance between us, and constantly telling each other we love each other. We made plans for all the things we wanted to do, places we wanted to go, and I told her I wanted to give her the life she never had. At some point, the staff realized, and tried to separate us, but before I left, those staff members were gone, and we could see each other yet again. I had seen her arms covered in scars from cutting, and that is the point where I had to start sneaking into her room to take stuff so she couldn't cut herself because the workers didn't do anything about it. On the final day, we were hugging at any possible second we could and repeatedly saying I love you, promising that we will begin to date once she is out of the next stage of treatment. I hugged her before I left, she promised me she'd be alive for me, and I had to leave. I had snuck her snapchat and Instagram accounts so I have her contact, but she is in residential. I looked into it and talked to my psychiatrist, and he said residential can be anywhere from 4 months to 2 years. She is the only reason I haven't ended it all. I feel horrible all the time. I've tried medicine, I've tried new sports and hobbies, I always feel like shit. I see so much suffering in the world, nothing brings me joy anymore, and the medicine puts me in constant pain. I'm scared I'm gonna end up trying to kill myself again, but I'm scared to go into another psych ward or residential. I leave her 2 paragraphs everyday on snap for when she gets back about how much I love her, and that's about the only coping I can do anymore. I promised her I'd give her it all, because she is my only motivation anymore, and the last thing I'm holding onto, but I may not get to see her for a year or more. I don't know what to do. Everyday is pain. I've tried and tried for a full year now, trying to stay alive for whatever I have to hold onto. She is the only hope I have left in this world and I can't even talk to her right now. I'm so lost and I don't know what to do."

If even do, they just say something generic like: ""it'll get better"" I feel like it won't. They don't listen to it and just shrug it off.

I had hopes. I had dreams.

You can't medicate away a demon.

Why do some people make it to live long lives and others' lives are cut tragically short? My idol and hero died at about the same age as I am now while the rest of his family has gone on to live long beautiful lives, god bless them. Why am I going to kill myself at 22 while my brothers are doing better than me and probably going to live long lives? Is it because we didn't know how to play it safe, me and my hero, or were we cursed from the start? When I go to heaven, I'm going to find out the truth finally and escape all the lies and deception in my head and the assault on my body.

I can perfectly mask everything around my siblings, parents, and therapist with little effort, but when I'm alone in my room, that's when it really hits. It feels like my social battery is always running on almost a overtime energy, cause when I'm alone I feel completely drained. But when I'm alone and everything just hurts, I prefer that. It's almost comforting. This'll sound stupid, but the one thing that keeps me going is that I can kill myself in the future, not doing it now so I don't do that to my siblings and parents, but when I'm in college or move out, if I want I can just cut contact and nobody will know. Thankfully, nobody would ever be able to tell what I feel from the outside, cause I can always force a smile, no problem.

I'm the one who always looking back to my past because my past self is too lively and shine so bright.

I remembered how good I am back then. Be able to do everything to my heart content. Everything was getting worse when I got serious asthma when I was nine. My dream as an athlete is over and got bullied because of my disability. I was forced to learn graphic designs by my parents to replace an employee that quit his job. I lost my goal in my life after that. I made countless mistakes and trouble. Everyone around me usually yelled and remind me of the flaws I made and they echo in my head. Every mistake that I made is not allowed. I can't forgive myself to make any mistakes again and become perfectionist. I always give up and want to start anew everytime I do something that is not how I taught. I lost my confident to do everything new including creative design. I lost even more confident when I saw the others are better than me and my parents keep compared me with them. I felt that I couldn't do anthing good to satisfy other people, I'm an all-rounder but with less capibility. I want to forget how useless I was and want to improve myself but the voices in my head echo everytime I did, telling me that I won't do it. The insults and rude words pop in my head like the field of sunflower that once one of it bloom all of it would come after. I lost my confidence in everything, my design ideas are fucked up, I can't recall anything to do it. I lived in this state until now, grade 12, the time for every student to continue to university. I want to enroll in Falculty of Graphic design, but the problem is this is Thailand, whose education system is full of competition. The others are far better than me. I checked my seniors' portfolio and I suddenly hopeless. The criteria of the university is they want student who have knowledge of art composition and graphic design by hand AKA handmade poster. I realized that I can't do anything like that, I only do graphic designs in computer and it is too late to learn that. People said that I kill myself for not being ready in the first place, and that made the voices echo louder. I was not allowed to make mistakes. I feel that I'm so dumb from the very beginning. I feel my heart shattered. If my family know about this, I don't know what would be the outcome. I'm not allowed to cry nor fail them. The major reason is I am the big brother in my generation in my family. The asian tradition that big brother must be the face of the family make me feel even worse that I failed everybody. I don't want to live to carry this burden anymore. I want to be erased from the others' memories, from the history. But I don't want to suicide either because of my brother. Although we weren't best bro, but I feel very sorry if he need to carry the hope of entire family instead of me, the failure brother that love him. I feel sorry for all of my friends in my entire life who supported me even they knew that it wouldn't help me anything.

&#x200B;

I feel heartache everytime I look my computer and my unfinish portfolio. I sigh everytime I can, and I can't sleep in the night. I feel useless even if I rushed my portfolio because there's no any idea come out of my mind. I tried to hand myself several times, but the voices remind me of the effects after my decision. It haunted me to give up my life but it also not. I don't know what I'm going to do. Fuck this life."

It's funny, that I keep getting into the same situation over and over. Almost comical. I run away from home, I get back home, then get institutionalized. Fuck. My life is a cycle of the same shit happening in the same shitty country but now it's getting worse and I can't find my father's gun. I hate it here, even if I want to change it.

God, give me peace of mind. Although my thoughts will leave me, at least the pain will cease. It's almost like death, but I need to keep living for another day. I know you don't love me, God, knowing you don't respect me. But hey, you kept me alive. God is an overbearing mother keeping their child in the garden of Eve.

I want to die. I’m so panicked thinking about having to continue living life and doing things and functioning. I feel like I’ve never been truly happy even before this current depressive episode. I was just getting through the days and coming home and always feeling like I was out of reach of something. Out of reach of being happy. Even when I planned something good to do it was never as good as I expected. Nothing would fill the emptiness I feel inside even when I buy something or do something nice or eat something as a treat to try and do something small to enjoy life. My boyfriend says it will get better and I’ll get back to how I was but I don’t think I want to. What is the point in working all the time to afford bills and snatched moments of doing things that isn’t work to try and get some enjoyment? I feel like my eyes have been opened and the thought of continuing to live makes me feel sick and anxious. How can I do it? How isnt everybody else depressed and wanting to kill themselves? I don’t feel like I can cope anymore. Killing myself feels like a comfort, like a security blanket that I know I can rely on. 

How long can I use it as a back up before I go ahead and do it. Everything is so meaningless and don’t see the point in living to just keep doing this over and over. I can’t see myself living past next week. I feel uncomfortable and panicked when people try and talk to me about things more than a few days in the future. At the start of this episode two months ago I was signed off work and started counselling and antidepressants. I thought I would feel better by now but it’s worse than ever. Everyone says make sure you feel better before you go back to work but how could I stop feeling like this? It’s all I think about. I’m not living for myself I’m living for my boyfriend and my family. There’s nothing that makes me want to stay here for me. How long can I live for other people?"

Recently I feel like my options are running out. I recently (about four months ago) moved back to my hometown, and it seems that all the stress and other stuff has finally piled up and it's coming back around to bite me in the ass. 

My mom has made some bad choices in the past, and as much as I hate to say it, it's sort of ended up affecting me as well. What has always worn me out the most about this whole thing is that nothing helps. No matter how much of my time and money and energy I put into trying to help her, it doesn't show up anywhere. It feels like the more I try the poorer, angrier and the more tired she gets. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm so exhausted that it's affecting my relationships a lot, especially the one with my boyfriend of four years. I get so tired and frustrated and I have no doubt it's tiring out everyone else as well. Such a vicious cycle and I have no clue how to put a stop to it. On top of this it seems like being so stressed for such a long time has finally started affecting my health too. In the past two weeks my condition has plummeted to the point where I have a hard time completing basic chores without feeling dizzy and short of breath. All tests so far have come back clear. The lack of answers honestly doesn't help with the feeling of hopelessness.

I wonder how much worse this will still get. Probably a lot. I hate how much I think about putting an end to all this, but it's hard to see another way out. It's been going on for such a long time. I'm so tired of being a burden and never being enough."

And I have the perfect plan. Today would be the perfect day to do it, because my mom and I are recently sharing a car while mine is in the shop, and she is at work with no car. I had a moment after dropping her off that I was like, okay I can actually go do it now if I want to, but then I started thinking about leaving a note and I don’t know what to write.

I sleep excessively. Am disappointed when I wake up and just try and get back to my dreams or just lay there and continue them on in my head. Then my waking hours are either watching YouTube videos, browsing Reddit or watching films. Sometimes I listen to music, lock myself in the bathroom and pretend I'm a character or another version of myself in the mirror. Someone who's good at guitar or violin, someone powerful and confident and worthwhile. 

Today I've come to the realisation that my actual self is worse than I thought. I had an argument with my brother today (a genuinely nice person) and he told me how I make him feel how I make my mother feel. I thought I was just worthless. Just someone who'll never get off their arse but I'm worse. I make the people around me feel like crap. When I'm frustrated or angry with myself I treat my family like shit. Snap at them, upset them. I was okay just existing, thinking I was neutral but now I know the impact I have on others, I can't be me anymore. 

I'm not asking for anything with this post. I just need to say it. I can't say it to anyone else."

Form to go to hell if can I even get in. There nothing that I necessarily aspire to be and how society is formed I won't be able to be happy. I'm just tired I feel like I shouldn't have been in this world to begin with. 

I haven't eaten since the day before yesterday and my mum has seen to give up on me so I have too. I just heard her saying how I'm lazy and indicisive and she tired if telling me what to do so good luck to me and then compared me to a pensioner. I already know that what she said is true but it hurts more when you hear it out loud.

At this point I've realise how much of a burden I've become on my friends and family even though that's what I was trying to avoid by not wasting money and she also gets annoyed at me easily so it just better if I'm not there. Because talking about my suicidalness is triggering for my friends I can't say anything so I feel alone. I'm just so tired why am I the selfish one if I don't want to be here it would be better. Well itd be better if I was someone else but that's impossible. I'm so tired can I not just sleep forever. I started searching up xanax pill but it seem I need a prescription so done with everything.

Thx for reading it all it's a bit of a mess I rarely express my feelings so doing so is a bit difficult stay safe peeps"

But at the moments im doing pretty good, therapy is good, I'm signing up for a bit of study, I have a job, nearly 5 months away from my narcissist ex.

I have plans to stream some of my comedy (just gotta work out how... work in progress!) My dad got me an amazing kitchen island (my kitchen table is one of the last pieces of furniture left behind by my ex, so I'm super excited to replace it! Dads coming to install it mid jan.) And I'm planning my first tattoo in dedication to the memory of my mum (passed 5th aug. 02)

But 

Sometimes, whether I'm at work, just chilling with my fat cats, or like tonight in the shower, I say very firmly (although quietly thank God cause it happened at work) I just say involuntary ""I WANT TO DIE""
I say it on the same tone as you might say ""I'M SO HUNGRY"" or ""I GOTTA PEE!""

thing is... I don't think I really want to?
Cause my kitties...
And I'm scared dying would hurt.
And my dad ...

I wonder if there's something in my subconscious trying to tell me something. 
However no idea how to bring this up with my councillor without him sending me to the psychiatric ward....

Can any one relate?"

There is a sickness inside of me, I have known about it for too long without having the courage to deal with it. No one would really suspect this kind of sickness from an adult woman that just reached her 20’s but unfortunately it has come down to it.

From a little girl it was pretty clear that I had thoughts of pedophilia and rape, it was hard to be around children younger than myself and even worse growing up, they just remind me of abuse. I must die, though I would never/have never hurt a child or have any inclination or desire to, the thoughts are still there and it’s terrifying. I infantilise myself with men because that is normal to me and yet sex is very uncomfortable. My porn addiction had worsened around the age of 9-10? and by then it was already too late. I’m worried that I’m one of them, one of those monsters, too tainted for redemption.

I cannot count the amount of failed life attempts nor the pleas of death that have followed them. There is no one to go to and no one that could possibly understand. I’ll never be normal and to live such a life doesn’t seem worth it. If you or anyone you know spots signs of child sexual abuse PLEASE report it, please do anything to protect that child because their suffering will know no bounds, there is too much suffering in this world and sometimes a victim can become the perpetrator."

I had to leave to go to my mum's today because I've been really unwell and can't handle the slightest emotional turmoil.  I can't handle what goes in my head 24/7.

I've been trying to die since I was 13.  All I want is to stay alive but I can't stand the pain inside my mind and body anymore.   
I know it's 1000% selfish. 3 people I know/am really close to in the past year have killed themselves and it hurts me so fucking much but I understand. I can't keep hurting the ones around me like this anymore. At least this pain will be final - no more to come afterwards. I'm not saying they won't hurt but I'll know that there's nothing else I can do that will contribute. 

I love my family, my boyfriend and his family, my friends so fucking much I wish I didn't have anyone in my life so I wouldn't leave anyone behind but I know that I have to do this. Me surviving just perpetuates the lie that I am okay. 

I'm not posting here to get anyone to tell me not to do this - just so in the case anyone realises that it's me will know just how fucking sorry I really am. I'm way too much of a coward to properly write a suicide note. 

Mum, Dad, Declan, Maxwell, Grandma, Ronnie, Raoul, Nick, Tom, Isi, Josie, Britt - everyone.  I really do love every single one of you. I thank you so much for loving me as much as all of you did.

Ugly without equal. So shallow it practically negates your own existence. Every breath you take is an insult to their person. Both **** and ***** were happier when around strangers they just met than they ever were with you and it is obvious because they choose to be around them and not you and when they talk about them they always smile and laugh which is in stark contrast to the afterthought you are; the obvious lack of enthusiasm and love when talking to or about you, though it is more likely they just never mention you or think much about you. Everyone has come to regret being with you. Everyone realizes it was a complete mental lapse that the words “I love you” were ever uttered in your direction. The fact that they are better off without you is now just that, a fact, one hundred percent empirically proven. There is no more thinking that it is ok because you feel like you love her because your love is a toxic delusion. You are incapable of feeling or being loved. You are a sociopath. You are a proven waste of time and space. You are a cautionary tale for women accidentally choosing to date a piece of shit. You are fucking pathetic. You are getting what you deserve.

She seems completely convinced that suicide is the most selfish thing you could possibly do and I on the other hand am not convinced... I asked her why she thought that and firstly she brought up the fact her friend killed himself and that was extremely selfish of him, we quickly got off the topic of him and focused more on our experiences with ourselves. She claimed that if she had committed suicide that it would’ve been super selfish of her because her mom once told her that if she ever killed herself then it would break her moms heart so much that she’d end up killing her self too. Therefore it would be selfish... I pointed out how that really contradicts itself since if her mom killed herself then what about the rest of her family? Her grandmother for example? Or her husband? Which she explained was only more proof because if she killed herself then the rest of her family would probably be so hurt that they’d all kill themselves... I don’t think that’s a good or even fair argument. I pointed out that some people genuinely have no family or friends so if they killer themselves who exactly would it be selfish to? Plus is it not selfish itself for someone to feel like another persons life belongs to them? The idea of it being selfish in itself sounds selfish alone. How dare you leave me to end your own suffering you terrible person. Doesn’t that just sound wrong? I’m not saying that suicide is necessarily the right thing to do or even a good thing... I’m just curious what people’s take on it being “selfish” I feel like the only way it could be selfish, perhaps under certain circumstances it could be selfish but I don’t think the act itself is. For example if you and someone you loved where both struggling but trying to support each other and one day you just decide to end it... but it would be just as selfish to just leave them even if it’s not suicide so I don’t think that counts. But if you where on the edge of suicide and the best people can do is tell you that you shouldn’t kill yourself because you’re selfish... well.... that’s kinda messed up"

Expanding my imagination is not really that helpful either. Even if I try and edit the past it's still fucking boring, because it's just not the same. I try and think of the future and it's still relatively boring. This is one of the many ways as to how you know I'm depressed.

But I can’t complete the act. I peer over bridge edges, ready to jump, but can’t make the leap. I can have the rope ready and tied around my neck, but I can’t bring myself to sit or jump. 

No one would care if I was gone. 

My boss and work, which is the primary reason I want to die, would hire someone by the end of the week. Now before you say “Macduff, get a new job.” I tried. No interviews. No callbacks. And it doesn’t matter, I cannot afford to quit and I cannot find a job that wouldn’t want to make me suicidal that I’m qualified for: all I’m good at is listening to entitled people bitch and complain, which of course, would put me back into the same situation. My last job I attempted suicide at and I attempted suicide at this job in July and in the past 2 weeks, et al.

My parents would be disappointed and angry, which is not a difference than what they felt before. They wouldn’t care. And neither does the universe: In fifty years, very few would remember my name. 100 years from now, history would continue without a feather ruffled. The stars turn, the world rotates. My existence will not matter and does not matter: I literally do not contribute a single thing to society.

Everyone claims Suicide is selfish because I’d pass the pain onto others...HOW THE FUCK IS IT NOT SELFISH TO FORCE ME TO LIVE IN SUFFERING? Because you are afraid of being a fucking adult and realizing my life isn’t worth living? Keeping me alive to suffer because you can’t emotionally handle the simple fact that we all die and I opt to do that sooner than later?

People on Reddit and friends say “OMG REACH ERT AND I’LL TERK.” But they stop. They don’t listen. They don’t respond. They’re tired. They ghost. And back to the drawing board on how I can be free I go.

I did everything right: I got therapy, I got meds. I took time off to get mental health care. Since I’ve been back, my life has been hell; which is exactly what it was before.

I want to be gone. Why, O Lord, can’t I follow up on this simple request?"

Almost 4 years on and off and the whole time I’ve loved them yet they never loved me. They said they want the new year to be theirs with their main focus on themselves. 
By Jan 1, they want to call it quits forever. I’m fully aware that what we’re doing isn’t very good yet just want to keep going. What we do makes me feel good and I feel no shame yet when I look at what we do and how they feel about it - in the present moment we feel good but later they tell me they feel shame and want to stop. 
My brain knows that what we do can’t last forever and that it has to end at some point, yet my body can’t stop aching. I’ve cried at least once about it every day since they told me that they want to stop for good and I don’t know if I’ll ever get over this. They’ve told me that they want to call it quits before, yet they always come back to me and I always greet them with open arms. 

I feel shame when I look at my naked body now, and think that all in good for is the pleasure of others and that I’m not deserving of real love.

All I want is to love someone and feel loved. This is the closest thing I’ve ever had to love and I hate the feeling of it falling out of my hands. I respect my partners choice of leaving and won’t stop them from leaving, yet at the cost of my happiness. 

I feel like a fool for letting what’s happened happen to me yet if I could, I’d do it all again in a heartbeat. I hate myself for feeling this way and feel like I’d be better off gone.

I abuse painkillers to make me feel numb and stop feeling. They make me drowsy and I soon fall asleep and stop experiencing the pain of real life. Yet they sometimes appear in my dreams, and my mind either teases me with the fantasy of them loving me, or slaps me in the face with reality, which leaves me waking up ashamed and embarrassed. 

I’ve gone through this spiral for almost 4 years and don’t want to let it go. I don’t know if I’ll be happier with or without them, and I don’t want to go on living without them. 

Anything I do brings me heartbreak and sadness. I wish I was dead, yet don’t have the gall to kill myself, it would hurt too much. 
I just want all the pain and sadness and crying to go away."

As the title suggests, I’m really reaching the point where I’m losing grip of myself. I have felt this way for a while, but its increasing, especially lately. I’ve even started having dreams about killing myself, something I’ve never witnessed prior. I’m seeing violent imageries of myself in various suicidal positions and I feel these hostile behaviors spiraling in my gut. I feel so sick sometimes. I just feel off. Everything feels so empty. It’s not just anger either, it’s violent. It’s this hostile aggression that gradually grows, it’s almost like an infatuation for the need to die. It feels like a priority. It’s something that feels elaborate, planned, and urgent or immediate. I feel so ready to die. I don’t feel connected to my own body. I don’t feel that I’m here. I just feel more drawn to some form of release than I ever have before. I seriously think I’m going to have to talk to my family about admitting myself to a psychiatric ward before this becomes too much. I’m just so tired of this. My mind is enamored by the thought of mutilating myself. It almost excites my head, but another aspect of my mind feels so sorry for it. It feels beyond my control, these thoughts don’t even feel like my own. I also found that my mom has a gun and I just feel more inclined to act out. Every single thing. Every object. Is making me feel more and more driven to act out if it can be used in that form. I need help. I know I do. I don’t know who to call. I can’t see my therapist again for a little while because I’m out of state. I just want to end these thoughts. I want to live. My split mindset doesn’t want me to though. I don’t even feel sorry for myself anymore. This feels so normal. I can’t even tell if this extreme or not. I really can’t. I guess what I’m trying to gain from this is if I should seek psychiatric help on a higher level? My therapy is calling sessions online. I am medicated, but it doesn’t seem to be working or is even worsening my mental state. I’m also a minor, meaning I would need some form of consent to be admitted. I just feel like it’s a matter of time. What do I do?"

I have nothing going for me, my family life is in ruins, I hate everything about myself, and it really doesn't feel like I'm making much of an impact on the people in my life. However, my friends mean the world to me. The bond we've formed is like no other, but I find it hard to live for somebody else. At this point it seems as if the only reason I haven't attempted to kill myself is because of how much they care about me. I really don't understand why my friends value me so much. I can easily be replaced, all I do is make stupid jokes and stuff like that. I don't really matter. I try to help them, but how am I supposed to help others when I can't even help myself.

Friends aside, my mom is another concern. All she has is me and my brother, who has issues of his own, and I feel like if I were to kill myself that would be the last straw for her. I'm not saying she would commit suicide, but too much has gone to shit in her life for her to lose me. 

I try to think of another reason to stay alive, something for myself, but there's nothing. I have no regard for my well-being. If I died in my sleep that would be the best case scenario, at least then it wouldn't be something in my control. There's just so much that I don't want to deal with. There's too much in my life that I need to fix or learn to cope with. I don't care enough about myself to try. I don't think I'd kill myself, but if those friendships start to fall apart who knows. I'm scared of what I might do to myself.

Whether it's due to Covid or their heavy chain smoking, I feel like it's only a matter of time before I lose them. And I don't want to see a world without them. The only two people who really love me unconditionally could be gone before I know it. I have trouble sleeping at night because I keep thinking about how if they die tomorrow, I wouldnt even be able to say with certainty what their favourite movie is, what their first job was in life, what their favourite memory is, etc. Basically I feel like there's like only a few years left of life hanging over their heads. And even tho I try and document things about them so I could remember, I never feel like there's enough time with them. There's not enough time with them and it's soooooo hard to see them because of covid. The lockdown measures are strict from where we live. I'll be going back home after the holidays because of work.

I can't help but feel like it's only a matter of time before I fuck up and disappoint my friends and boyfriend. And nobody other than my parents can tolerate hearing sadness for more than a single conversation; It's like an illness to them, and it drives people away. So who the heck can I lean on when my parents do eventually pass? Nobody would want to stomach the burden of supporting me through that heartbreak. I'd be all alone without my parents.

I can't think of anyone else besides my parents who would stay with me on my deathbed if there ever comes a time when that happens. I feel so sad and lonely. Tired of living, scared of dying."

My dad fought cancer for almost two year and still died in July. My little sister is what keeps me going but when my older, college aged sibling are back in town she treats me like shit. I’m so sick of it.

My older sister ignores me entirely, calls my little sister “sweetie, honey, baby” like all the cute names, and constantly invites her to do stuff with her and spend time with her and never asks me. Ever. She doesn’t hate me but god she acts like she couldn’t care less if I lived or died and honestly I’m ready to prove it. 

My mom is incredibly emotionally abusive or manipulative so she’s no help and I spend most of my time consoling her, and anything I bring up regarding my feelings she throws back at me, and shuts me down. My older brother is the typical college frat boy, so He‘s no help either.

This was my breaking point. I’m on a ski trip, my first one without my dad. He was a big skier, the best. This is such a painful trip and honestly there’s so much going on I can’t do it. I want to walk into the creek and drown and fall asleep in the cold of nothingness. I want to be out of the pain so badly. The only reason I’m still here is my boyfriend, he’d be crushed if I died. I can’t do it but I can’t deal with the pain. Please help me please"

So far each of my partners have let me know they think my penis is small and that they prefer bigger. Every single day I think about death or what it would take for me to kill myself because I don’t feel like anyone is someone that I’m looking for and I am who someone is looking for, and I don’t mean in a destiny kind of way, just a comfortably compatible way.

I can’t shake the idea that I’m one of the disposable men that gets lost to history. Completely forgotten, living in misery, working just to be taxed, not get any satisfaction from life etc. 

What’s the worst part is I’ve experienced being in a relationship that I want, and I’ve got the attention from the people that I’d want it from, but it all falls apart when they don’t want actual sex. All of the other intimacy means nothing to me if there is no mutual satisfying sex. Life is a curse."

I don't have a job, I'm in uni full-time. I've been very depressed. 

I don't have a lot of friends, which is probably why I've managed to become addicted like this to a game. I'm so stressed about money with probably £1000 overdrawn and yet here I am spending money on this game. I've made friends with people through it so I can't just uninstall it and I've spent so much that it would be a waste to just leave it now. I need to get a job somewhere. 

Covid means everything in my life is shit. I don't know how to explain it other than I haven't had sex in months, I'm behind on all my work and this game just takes up all my time. I'm overweight, I'm lonely, I'm poor, I'm stupid. This all seems to be leading to only one place. A place where I've been before. When I was 17 I attempted suicide during my college exams by jumping into traffic. It didn't work obviously. In fact I barely got injured at all. Now I'm at my parent's house for Christmas and I couldn't kill myself here because I wouldn't want to hurt them. My plan is to kill myself after my 21st birthday which is coming up soon while I'm away at my flat by jumping off this bridge I have in mind. I don't want to but I feel like I have to.

Since I'm a trans woman and started hormone replacement therapy in 2015, I had to go off my hormones to try and start producing sperm again. With that brought on depression and dysphoria.

After being off my HRT for 10 months and fucking like rabbits with no results, I went to a couple of specialists and found out that I am not producing any sperm at all. It could be because of the hormones, or I could have just been sterile from the beginning. Who knows. 

I started hormones again back in August, and the last couple months have been a wild ride. I quit my job, my wife and I got married, and of course the pandemic has continued. We've been arguing a lot. She's bipolar and now also experiencing seasonal depression, and tonight told me that if she can't have a baby, she doesn't see the point in continuing life. We're almost out of money, I still haven't found a job, and we have 2 vials of sperm waiting from a sperm bank, and that's our last hope. Her family doesn't support our relationship (again, I'm trans and she's not, and her family are Baptists, while we've both converted to Judaism). So we have no one we can really turn to for actual support. 

At this point, IDK if it would be better for us to just separate and eventually go our own ways or for me to kill myself because I don't think I can take having another family leave me. She talked about killing herself and leaving me the house and her life insurance but my whole fucking life has shown me I'm worth nothing to anybody. I'm so fucking tired of being strong and keeping myself going, and she feels the same way. I emailed my rabbi for advice/help, and if he can't help I don't know what we're going to do. We might lose our house next month if the stimulus doesn't arrive in time, and I really don't want to be homeless again.

Why can’t I just go to my doctor and say I wanna die. We do some paperwork they hear my reasoning and they end my life quickly and painlessly. It’s my life I should be able to choose to die. I have no one. One of my friends hasn’t replied to me since August 6th but they reply to everyone else. My other friend just got into another new relationship and doesn’t give a duck about me anymore. Honestly I keep wanting to just grab all of my pills and hoping my body doesn’t force me to throw up. Why is living so hard?

Anyways, yesterday night I tried to kill myself, I tried stabbing myself and all I got was a little cuts, and I've almost jumped out of my window, but my aunt messaged me and asked if I was okay, and we called. Weirdly enough. Anyways a week ago I just got out of a treatment centre for my last suicide attempt, I took over 30 pills of Tylenol and Advil, and I drank nyquil on the 5th of this month. I stayed in the hospital for 3 days, then I went to a psyche ward, then the center. All I got was melatonin. Anyways, no one knows this about me, but I am addicted to benzos and alcohol. My mom died last month, that's why I attempted, she was my motivation to live, I feel so lost without her. I've been suicidal for years, I've attempted over 5 times. I self harmed. I've been abused in many ways, I have severe anxiety and depression, PTSD, and probably much more things. I'm done with trying to live, I'm sick and tired. I have no more hope or motivation anymore, all I feel is emptiness, a dark void that can't be fulfilled. I've already said goodbye to everyone I need to and I wrote a note. Goodbye everyone, hopefully I am dead by tomorrow morning. p.s. thank you I guess for reading all of that shit.

Edit: I will now attempt suicide. If I don't then I guess I'll update this. Anyways seriously, goodbye."

I won’t deny that I’m extremely lucky. I have parents who love me. A roof under my head. And a room for myself. I’m so lucky, my friends are there when I need them and I’m there for them. But there has to be something fundamentally wrong with me. Every time I go to bed I have to listen to something so I won’t have to scream at the top of my lungs in my head. When presented with the fact I have to deal with life I get scared and everything seems to crash around me. Snd then I think how dumb it is for me to feel the way that I feel. I berate myself every time inside my head that I’m not enough for anyone around me or the things I have. Right now as I type this I feel completely narcissistic like I’m bragging about my good life. I hate it. Every aspect of myself I hate, I’m not good enough. One time time I had a breakdown or panic attack I’m not sure of which but I knew something was going to happen. In my dark room listening to music I couldn’t handle it. And I felt dead in the inside my head was blank and my body started to move by itself. I knew if I left my bed I wouldn’t gone downstairs and put a knife through my chest. Then after a while I stopped myself and it happened again, this time my legs were yearning to go downstairs and I had to pull myself by my bed to stay there or else I would’ve done something stupid. Then as I felt like I was ready to move again I took one step and knew if I took that second one forward I would end my life. A week or two after that I had a dream of doing a group suicide with cyanide pills. Today I had a dream of commuting suicide by jumping off a building with someone. I feel as though these feelings are a fraud that I’m making them up for attention and that it’s not real. During one breakdown my mother came into my room. I regret that. She saw me in this state of weakness. I’m not supposed to do that because I was taught that taking upon suffering and not bothering others is the correct thing to do. I don’t know anything. Everything is confusing. I don’t know if what I’m feeling is valid. I don’t know if I feel this way for attention. I don’t know if I should keep on going. I don’t know anything except one thing. I hate the person who I am and  the things I think and the actions I say and the feelings I have."

I attempted 3xs and before I could finally do it right, my doctor saved me. When my insurance ran out, the suicidal ideations came back and I've struggled so hard for the last 3yrs. I've had so many suicidal ideations with plans, but would cope by utilizing negative destructive coping mechanisms.   


This year was awful. I was used by a guy who treated me like absolute garbage. When I would feel suicidal and call him for support, he would literally say to me: ""I don't want to fucking hear it, don't come to me with that shit, go call someone who wants to hear it, call a doctor, I have nothing to say about it."" Of course that just made things even worse but stupid me was so in love with him I couldn't detach myself. He'd break up with me every other weekend and then we'd get back together with him always promising me he'd actually put effort into our ""relationship"", he's done with his ex, bla bla bla. He wasn't and he's lied all the time. 

There were so many times I nearly ended my life - not just over him - but bc my life just sucks! No job, no source of income, tons of student loan debt, living at home at my age (40) and not getting along with my parents bc they treat me like I'm 12, and now being treated like absolute shit by someone I was madly in love with who completely fooled me into thinking he had feelings for me, too, when all along he was using me. I can't count how many times I had a plan and was ready but I would sob myself into exhaustion and sleep then do a bunch of self-destructive stuff to deal until I could get my hands on whatever my plan involved.

Well, December has always been my favorite f\*cking year of the month for no reason at all. The one month out of the year I oddly feel really happy for no reason at all. I always look forward to December! Only this year it sucked bc I was still with that jerk. He'd invite me to go fishing with him, his brother and sister-in law on Saturdays. We'd go to the store and he'd have me buy stuff to share like 2 boxes of soda and snacks. I'd leave it at his place bc we'd be leaving from there anyway. Then the day before the trip, he'd pick a fight w me, break up with me, and he'd go fishing taking all the stuff I bought and they'd enjoy it all. He'd always roll his eyes and say it's not like he can't replace it, but he never did. The kicker was that he received my super expensive Christmas presents (nearly $300 worth), I know he really liked the stuff bc it's what he wanted, he acknowledged receiving my gifts, and it took him an entire day to say, ""uhh thanks."" in an extremely forced awkward way. After that, he dumped me..... on Instagram...... He blamed it on me, but I called him out on it. Doesn't matter bc in his twisted head he's already justified it that it's all my fault as usual. But this time he admitted that he's not happy and doesn't want to deal with me when there's plenty of other ""broads"" out there. He made such a fuss about me having some of his clothes that he GAVE me claiming I stole them- 3 zip up hoodies that he said I could have bc they had holes in them and he just bought 3 more to replace them, 2 shirts that he said he never wears and never will bc it's not his style, and 1 sweatpants that he said was perfect for me bc it's way too small for him and doesn't fit him. I returned them in a box without contacting or seeing him. He texted ""Thanks for the (box emoji)"", meanwhile he has $60 worth of my things at his place. Right now he's full of life and telling everyone I exhausted him and was suffocating him this whole time when he was the one who was absolutely awful to me and used me for his convenience . But it still feels like crap to hear things like that, you know? On top of that, his ex is still harassing me! I don't even get why!!! I'm not even in the picture anymore, but she got a hold of my email address by going through his email account MONTHS ago (she's a psycho obsessed manipulative bitch) and she keeps sending me weird stuff: sooooo many blank emails from multiple made up accounts, registers me for random sites where women strip for guys through webcam, registers me for so much spam, and on and on! I know it's her bc I've never received so much retarded stuff to my email account until she got a hold of it. Literally after that, it's been blowing up with stupid shit; she thinks she's so slick but she's really stupid. It was a really really sh\*tty Christmas this year. I didn't get a single present or card and I spent it alone. But I'm proud of myself bc for once, I didn't have that innate urge to kill myself. I feel like I'm getting stronger. I'm hurting insanely crazy and life still definitely sucks, but for the first time, the thought didn't even cross my mind! I guess I just didn't know who/where to turn to about this bc it doesn't feel like anyone understands the struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - This jackass made my year miserable and I always wanted to kill myself all year long bc it was so tumultuous (I've been suicidal but he amplified it A LOT). He ruined the best month of the year for me knowing this is my favorite month and he kicked me out of his life after receiving my $300 Christmas gifts to him. But for the first time ever, with all the crappy stuff going on in my life, suicide didn't cross my mind and I'm so proud of myself! I'm still in a lot of emotional pain and wish I had support but I don't know who to turn to so I thought I'd post here.

[edit] for whatever reason I can’t see the comments that were left for me! Can anyone help? I’d like to know what feedback I received! Thank you!"

Even though I know it's how you express sympathy it's just not what I need to hear and it means practically nothing to me. I feel harsh saying that because you know I'm not a harsh person. I've always been a kind and understanding person but I'm getting to the point where I've lived with this for so long and I've lived without the support I need for so long that this is where I'm at. The good news is I know what I need. Maybe not what I need to get out of this hole I'm in (still working on that in therapy) but I know what kind of support I need. The bad news? I'm not getting it and I don't know how to ask you for it. What I really need from my you is love. I need to be hit over the head with it because it just won't stick in my brain. I just need to know that you care, love me, need me, would miss me if I was gone etc. I need to know what makes me worth something because I feel so worthless. I need to know what are my good qualities? What do you like about me? Because it hit pretty hard in therapy recently when I was asked what I like about myself and I had nothing that wasn't tainted with negative thoughts.

When I feel like I might be able to do something basic like eating or going to the bathroom I just break down again.

This week I went through a breakup. Even writing that word it doesn’t feel right. It was the only person keeping me alive these past two years and now without him I’m alone again, what’s worse is my family and friends had no clue how bad I’ve been these months so they’re unprepared when I come to them and ignore me or give me crap advice like “exercise or take a break and relax”. No one picks up their phone or texts back, if they do they sigh in annoyance and give an excuse to hang up quickly.

Today is maybe the last day for me. I don’t see myself past this week and every time I get to this point it feels less and less like I’ll come out alive. Part of me wanted to try getting help but it looks so difficult I might just give up if this pain doesn’t stop. I’m gonna do it."

I keep thinking how much I want to die, and I have discussed that with her.  She always changes the subject when I do.  I should have realized that was not a normal reaction.

&#x200B;

I hit my low today, and I grabbed everything in our medicine cabinet and downed it.  All of it.  And...she got up...and walked out of the room.

&#x200B;

What was she thinking in that moment?  That when the cops came, she wanted to be able to say she didn't see it happen?

&#x200B;

She made no move to stop me.  She just got up and walked out.

&#x200B;

So I went to the next room and sat down.  I thought about things, long and hard.  I made myself throw up and I thought some more.  I would be very surprised if anything is still in me.  My stomach feels like a brick.  But I might go to the ER anyway.

&#x200B;

It's so clear now that she doesn't love me and never did.  Right now, I can hear her listening to music.

&#x200B;

I don't know what happens next, especially since I foolishly let her move me away from everyone and everything I knew.  I have lost a lot of friends and relatives because of her.  I feel like I just woke up from a coma.  The worst part is that people warned me she was like this.  They warned me.  But I thought I knew better.

&#x200B;

The desire to die has not gone away.  It's just been replaced by this ugly wakeup call.  I truly do not know what comes next.

&#x200B;

I don't know why I'm even posting this.  To vent?  A warning?  Don't be stupid like I was.  Fuck.  I have to either get out, or die."

**No future**

I'm  a BS in Biology. I'm applying for jobs at temp agencies but the only  interviews I'm getting are from MLMs. There are always menial jobs  available, but this just confirms to me that I will be paying off my  debts through minimum wage jobs the rest of my life. All these open  opportunities that people talk about is bullshit. There are none for me  because I have no networking, I have wasted the last eight years all for  nothing, and there is nothing ahead.

**Settlement**

I  refuse to settle for my future than for what I could have become. But  at this point, how could I not settle? I can't afford grad school. It's  still an unlikely climb for me to break into a M7 MBA program. If I have  to choose life and take in the bullshit that mental health  professionals want to sell me, then I have to forever live with the fact  that I will always be lesser than what I could have been. This isn't  even pride, I have to accept the fact that I settled for my future.

**Lack of Mourning**

My  brother is the most stoic individual I met. I honestly doubt my suicide  will affect him. Perhaps he will be angry that he is now financially  responsible for my mother. My mother will be hit the hardest; and it  won't surprise me if she follows me. I'm taking steps that this won't  happen by leaving suicide loss groups for her to contact.

But  I honestly think her death will be inevitable. I was her meal ticket,  and once she hears I was expelled, it will hit her incredibly hard. She  will be terribly affected either way and her life is bound to shorten  regardless.

I don't have friends.  My deans never gave a shit about me. No one will ultimately miss me  except for my mother, but honestly this is best path forward. Otherwise  she'd forever be worried about my future, trying to help me financially  despite the fact that I am supposed to provide for her instead.

**Debt cancellation**

Medical  school is expensive, and I took out a lot of loans. Honestly, I think  I'm okay living with debt; in perspective it's like owing a couple car  payments. And If I could get back into medical school and put myself in  more debt, I'd take it. But the fact that my debts won't be transferred  to my family and that they can keep the student loans I have taken out  does help me pursue this decision.

**Difficulty**

Suicide just seems so much easier than life itself. I understand it's  cowardly, but I have accepted the fact that I am one for various reasons  and the label won't throw me off this path. If my deans won't give me a second chance, why would I. I don't deserve redemption, nor am I even irredeemable. You cannot lose if you refuse to play.

**Poetry**

Perhaps  the dumbest reason of all, but in some ways I feel I'm destined to kill  myself. There are jokes among my dad's side of the family of a family  curse, since it's so much like Asian arrested development. My great  grandfather was an orphan who became a self-made wealthy landowner, and  each generation since has gotten misfortune. There's a joke about  deadbeat sons in every family. In my grandfather's that was my youngest  uncle, who killed himself. His oldest brother was murdered, but before  that he had to beg his wife not to divorce him; the widow later received  a large life insurance payout (she had nothing to do with the murder).  My dad's sister was hoodwinked into a marriage and now lives poorer than  us by selling gingseng she collects with her family on the countryside.  And it seems fitting for me to end my life this way too, with no where  else to go."

Things haven’t gotten much easier for me. Incessant yelling from my family or my own voices has kept me from being happy and wanting to move forward.

I eventually found a loving group of online friends who at least put some effort into caring for me for who I am. And in turn, I hope to care for them too. It’s almost like being part of a family again. Thanks to them, I pushed back my planned day. 

How do I feel about it? Well I’m not too sure. I can’t tell if it’s going to be a push to another day or a chance for these feelings to finally start going away. I guess I’m happy that I’m still here for now. And I’ll do my best to cherish this moment.

i’m not sure if this belongs on this subreddit but i think it’s sorta the best fitting one. if it isn’t i’d appreciate if you could tell me where i should post this.

honestly i don’t think i’m suicidal or depressed, i have almost everything i want and i have people i can trust and tell my problems to. sometimes i get like a wave of sadness but i’m fairly sure everyone gets that, that sometimes makes me want to leave everyone and go to sleep for the next year. but i’ve been starting to cut myself and i don’t know why, it hurts when i use my knife to cut myself but i do it anyway. the first time i just cut myself i did a small one but i’ve doing it more and giving myself larger scars and wounds. i want to stop but the moment i get the urge i have to cut even if it’s a small one, i can’t tell anyone cause they’ll all think i’m doing it for attention and my parents will think i’m sick. that’s sorta it but i wanted to post this so if i do spiral into being suicidal and killing myself someone can know how it started i guess. maybe this is just a phase for me and i’ll grow out of it eventually. i know there are people who actually need help so don’t waste time on me and go find other posts who truly need someone to talk to. this is just so i know someone knows."

I go to the best school in the country for my major. I'm a funny guy. I'm not friendless or anything. But for the past five years, barely a day goes by where I don't think about killing myself.

I have to blame myself here. My psychiatrist calls it anhedonia: I just don't get pleasure out of much of anything. Nothing is ever enough for me. When good things happen, I say its coincidence, luck, or thanks to someone else. When bad things happen, I take it to be some profound personal failing and immediately start to spiral or have panic attacks. I know it's not rational. Meds don't do jack shit. Neither did therapy. I can't escape the cycle.

I feel like I'm having my youth stolen from me. I've been volatile and depressed for 25% of my life now. Through all of high school and now half of college. The ""doomer"" is who I am at this point, it's the only shell of a normal person plenty of my friends have ever known. I've only kissed two girls in my life. I'm about to turn 20 with my v-card fully intact. For those who have their standards set low enough to even look at me, they eventually get tired of my shit, and I deserve it. Moreover, I don't think ANYONE (friends or family) actually enjoys my presence. They probably just keep me around so they can keep their consciences clean for when I inevitably go through with it. 

With the pandemic, my sense of agency and control over my fate is slipping away. I can't even keep myself distracted with work anymore—too unfocused and apathetic. I went from straight-A to straight-C's for the first time this past semester, shutting the door on a lifelong dream to go to grad school. My social circles are dwindling. I feel like I'm watching myself burn through years of my life with little recourse. I'm going through the motions. I really don't feel like I've been alive for years.

What the fuck am I going to do? I don't think I can take another 5 years like this...I'm so scared."

Every time I start to spiral I watch community and this line from the intro always resonates with me. Every time things feel like they’re getting better, everything gets fucked up. Whenever I feel like my life is improving, and I have things to look forward to, my partner and I get in a fight, or a bill comes up, or somebody dies. I feel like every day is just a test of how much I can internally go through before I finally snap and hang myself, intentionally OD (I don’t even do those kinda drugs), or just drive myself off a cliff. I frequently fantasize about rope or my car being airborne and falling hundreds of feet down. 

My now ex just keeps manipulating me and lying to me. He will do anything to get his way and doesn’t care who he hurts to do so. He will lie and manipulate when he is being found out, change the story and threaten. We just had a great Christmas together and had to have some cataclysmic fight 2 days later, and now we broke up right before New Years. I’m just going to drink until the New Year and then get out of town for a while to clear my head and make some space between myself and all this. 

If things in my life don’t start changing for the better I won’t be able to continue. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 10 years and it’s not getting better. Brief moments of growth overshadowed by months of regression. I feel like a lost fucking cause and all I do is drain my family financially and emotionally. I meltdown so hard I can’t even function on these bad days. I just lay in bed and smoke and drink and try to feel okay enough to do something. 

Someone help, just fucking end me since I’m too much of a pussy to do it myself. I want to die. I want all this pain that has been my life to end and to feel nothing. Closest I can get is being blackout"

I recently had to cut out a group of people in my life due to toxicity and in doing so, I also managed to cut out a person whom I had taken an interest in. It's been nearly a week again of not uttering a single word to a person. I've done so in the past as well and it's making me so damn anxious.

Every step I try to make towards not being alone only seems to isolate myself away from others even more. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like this. I spend every single day alone, in tears just trying to get to sleep, but only managing to get in about an hour or two.

Wherever I try and go to seek help, it doesn't work. Therapy, psychiatry, public events to meet new people, online platforms like discord and reddit and so much more.

It all just leads back to me finding another place to feel sorry for myself. It's a never ending cycle in which I'm learning how pathetic and horrible of a person I really am. Instead of blaming the people around me, I should be blaming myself. There must be a reason why people keep leaving and this recurring pattern just goes to show it's not them, it's me.
